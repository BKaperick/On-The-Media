For the first time we have a figure from the 2016 Trump campaign who we know is cooperating with special counsel Robert S Mueller III in his Russia investigation George Papadopoulos is talkingExactly what that means we dont really knowBut thats just one of several big juicy questions emanating from  The document is filled with anonymous campaign officials on the other end of Papadopouloss emails We now know who a few of them are thanks to  but a few big ones are still unknown In many cases aides seem to have known about contacts with Russia that the campaign and its principals including President Trump would later denyBelow are four big questions we have in light of and three that have been answeredAt the very end the indictment says Papadopoulos was arrested at Dulles International Airport in suburban Washington on July 27 of this year It says he has talked with the governmenton numerous occasions to provide information and answer questionsItis suspected that the special counsel is trying to flip Paul Manafort and get him to cooperate via his own indictment Papadopoulos was far less central to the campaign but here we actually have someone who is cooperatingWhat did he agree to share in his plea deal And what does he even  to share This may be the biggest question of allThe indictment says Papadopoulos attended a national security meeting about March 31 with Trump and other foreign policy advisers for the campaignIt saysPapadopoulos told the group that he had connections and could arrange a Trump-Putin meetingThe text doesnt technically saywhether Trump was present when this claim was made But if he was it would render Trumps own denials of his campaigns contactwith Russia pretty dishonestThe campaign and the White House have  The denials even came from Trump himself and Vice President Pence But this particular set of emails (and more to come below) suggests that several members of the campaign were aware of contacts discussing a desire on behalf of the Russian government to broker a meetingWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday she was not sure that the president recalls specific details of the meetingThis is yet another high-level aide who would have known there was contact with Russia Papadopoulos told this adviser on April 25 that these governments tend to speak a bit more openly in neutral cities  playing up his own stationing in LondonIt may be neither here nor there in this whole sequence but Papadopoulos seems to have believed at one point that the unnamed London professor introduced him to Putins niece identifying her as such in an email to the campaignHe later says it wasnt actually Putins nieceBut who was it And did Papadopoulos not seek to verify this information Or was he trying to inflate his connections in the email Its all very strangeAnd below are the questions The Post has been able to answerAfter a March 24 2016 meeting with the unnamed London professor and an unnamed Russian national whom Papadopoulos at one point believed to be Vladimir Putins niece Papadopoulos emailed a campaign supervisor and several members of the campaigns foreign policy team according to the document He told them the meeting was to set up another meeting between the campaign and Russian leadership to discuss US-Russia ties under President TrumpThe campaign supervisor at this point replied Great workLater about June 1 Papadopoulos emailed the same supervisor to say that a Russian MFA wanted to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin The supervisor urged Papadopoulos to make the trip with another foreign policy adviser insteadIn a tantalizing footnote someone described as a high-ranking official on the Trump campaign forwarded a Papadopoulos email to another official in late May and said We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signalSo yet again we have a top official in the campaign who was aware of Papadopoulosscontacts with Russia  Papadopoulos titled the email Request from Russia  and thought it through enough to offer a different course of action Along with the supervisor and members of the foreign policy team above thats another apparently high-ranking Trump campaign official who knew about this How could the campaign and White House go on to deny such contactsAlso juicy here What does so as not to send any signal mean Some see that as a potential tell when it comes to a larger effort to coordinate with the Russians which is the big unanswered question in this whole investigation But it could also simply be that they didnt want to telegraph a close alliance with Russia which could have been politically problematicThis is a different high-ranking official from the one mentioned above But its another person who apparently knew based on multiple emails about what the campaign and White House would later denyThe 18th and 19th of each month were busy days at the Woori bank branch in the Kaesong industrial complexSalaries for the 54000 North Koreans who worked in the interKorean economic zone on the northern side of the demilitarized zone that separates the estranged countries were due by the 20thSo the managers of the 123 South Korean companies operating there would head to the Woori branch a couple of days before to withdraw cash Always in US dollars and usually in $100 or $50 notesEvery month the accountant would tally the hours of each worker and each worker would check their hours and sign a list said Ok Sung-seok head of Nine Mode a clothing company that hired 300 North Koreans until The manager of the factory would go to the Woori branch in Kaesong and take out the money in US dollars Ok said The cost for hiring each worker was between $180 and $200 a monthThen with the cash in an Woori bank paper bag the company representative would drive five minutes down the road to a management office and hand over the cash to the North Korean officials thereFor more than a decade South Korean companies have been handing over bags of greenbacks to the North Korean regime in this wayWhen it was opened in 2004 the idea was that the Kaesong industrial complex would help lessen the economic gap between North and South and at the same time expose a few isolated North Koreans to the outside world The government theory went that these benefits outweighed concerns about what the north might do with the moneyBut now that has all changedPark Geun-hye the South Korean president has acted with unusual decisiveness  and acted alone following her gut instinct advisers say  to  in the wake of North Koreas nuclear and missile tests and with it the sunshine policy era of engagementShes the president The buck stops with her said a senior government official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberationsIn an address last week  that the money South Korea was sending through Kaesong was helping the runaway Kim Jong Un regime This echoes what critics of the project had been saying for a decadeSouth Koreas government estimates that it has sent more than half a billion dollars to North Korea through Kaesong over the past 12 years including $120 million last year alone By the time it closed this month 54000 North Koreans were working in 124 Southern-owned factories in the zone making an average of about $160 a monthThey did not receive any of the money instead being paid in vouchers that they could use in local stores No ones knows what proportion of the monthly payment each worker received but the Daily NK a South Korean website with sources inside the North   or about $30The $560 million sent through Kaesong was in addition to the $487 million it sent through the Kumgangsan tourist resort in the years it was open according to unification ministry statistics and the $22 billion in fertilizer rice and disaster assistance from South to North since the mid-1990sParks decision to end the last major engagement project with North Korea was the result not just of North Koreas actions but also of ChinasIn the three years since she took office Park has made concerted efforts to woo China including risking annoying Washington by attending a military extravaganza in Beijing last year Yet after North Korea conducted its nuclear test at the beginning of January Chinese President Xi Jinping refused to take a phone call from Park for a month according to multiple people with knowledge of the situation When they finally talked the Chinese leader didnt say anything that hadnt already been said in the official media anything that couldnt have been said the day of the test said one person who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversationsParks decision to close Kaesong  and also to open discussions with the United States about hosting an  that China staunchly opposes  is meant as a signal that South Korea will do everything it can to punish North Korea and it expects other countries to do what they can analysts sayChina which shares a long border with North Korea is by far its largest trading partner and therefore has the most leverage over its errant neighborThe Kaesong complex was shut down once before  by North Korea which withdrew its workers during a period of heightened tensions in 2013 But experts think that this time the closure is permanentRealistically its closed for good said Lee Jong-seok who was South Koreas minister of unification during the sunshine policy years and remains a strong proponent of engagement Now that the South Korean government has alleged that the money is going into North Koreas nuclear program theres no way they can reopen thisPark had tried to find a middle ground between the sunshine policy and the hard-line tendencies of her predecessor pursuing what she called a trustpolitik approach to North Korea  a combination of carrots and sticks But the nuclear test and missile launch forced her to call an end to this approachShes come to realize that trustpolitik doesnt work said Chun Yung-woo national security adviser to Parks predecessor and an advocate of a much tougher approach to the North Shes now decided to speak the language that North Korea understands the language of sanctions and regime change Yoonjung Seo contributed to this reportAfter the historic ouster of  on Friday scandal-weary South Koreans began turning their attention to a new election due within 60days  and to the prospect that her successor could try to reset relations with neighboring North Korea and its powerful patron China In the three months since Park was suspended over corruption allegations plunging the country into limbo amid protracted impeachment proceedings the regime in North Korea has launched five  and is accused of  of the leaders half brotherAdd to that Chinas anger over the deployment of a US  to South Korea and uncertainty about President Trumps administration in Washington and the lack of leadership in South Korea could hardly have come at a more sensitive time  A political vacuum like this in a key ally that borders a major nuclear threat is not good for the US said John Delury an American political scientist in Seoul I think its been underestimated as a danger and as a destabilizing factorSecretary of State Rex Tillerson will encounter this problem firsthand when he arrives in Seoul next week for discussions about North Korea with a South Korean counterpart who is on his way out Tillerson will also hear about the rise of a progressive candidate whose approach toward China and North Korea could differ sharply from that of the impeached president  and from the stance of the United StatesThe Trump administration is conducting a policy review to decide how to deal with North Koreas threats and there is plenty of talk in Washington about kinetic options  a euphemism for some kind of military action Meanwhile in Tokyo some ruling-party lawmakers are openly pushing for Japan to develop the capacity to preemptively strike North KoreaThat is the kind of talk that South Korea should be shutting down Delury said In addition to its nuclear and missile programs North Korea has conventional artillery lined up along the demilitarized zone and aimed at Seoul a metropolis of 25million peopleThe role of a South Korean president whether liberal or conservative is to be the person who gently takes that option off the table Delury said referring to a preemptive strike The South Korean president has to be saying If you take out their missile pad they take out our capital But that hasnt been happeningPark was immediately dismissed from office Friday after South Koreas Constitutional Court upheld a legislative impeachment motion ruling unanimously that she had continuously broken the law  Elections will be held in early May and the latest opinion polls show Moon Jae-in a progressive who unsuccessfully challenged Park for the presidency in 2012 holding a strong leadMoon favors the sunshine policy of engagement with North Korea  the liberal idea from the late 1990s that engagement can help open up the closed state and narrow the gap between the two KoreasThis sunshine policy ended in 2008 with the election of a conservative president who took a tough approach toward North Korea a stance maintained by ParkFollowing North Koreas nuclear test at the beginning of last year Parks government  that was the linchpin of the sunshine policy accusing the North of using South Korean cash from economic engagement projects to bankroll its weapons programsMoon however has said he would like to resume engagement with North Korea and would go to Pyongyang for talks with its leaderIf Moon wins the general election he will emphasize South Koreas alliance with the US and a strong defense posture said Lee Chung-min a professor of international relations at Yonsei University But his heart will lie in fostering deeper engagement with the North and negotiating an early summit with Kim Jong UnMoon has also signaled an openness to reviewing the Park governments agreement to host the United States Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) antimissile battery  The agreement was reached last year to protect against North Korean missiles and the system was due to arrive in South Korea this summer But in a surprise announcement the Pentagon said the first shipment arrived in South Korea on MondayThis has sparked widespread speculation in South Korea that the United States expected Park to be impeached and wanted to make the deployment more difficult to reverse The US military command in South Korea said the deployment was being carried out according to scheduleChina has vehemently objected to the arrival of THAAD in the region viewing the deployment as a US attempt to keep China not just North Korea in check To prod Seoul to change its mind Beijing has imposed painful restrictions on South Korean imports ranging from toilet seats to pop musicWe are all very clear that the crux of the problem between China and South Korea is that South Korea is ignoring Chinas concerns and is deploying the THAAD antimissile system with the United States Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said FridayWe once again urge South Korea to focus on the interests of the Chinese and Korean people he saidBut analysts say that even if the progressive Moon becomes South Koreas next president he will face difficulties in backtracking on THAAD or returning to the sunshine policyWhile China might expect a U-turn over THAAD if Moon becomes president it will be extremely difficult for Moon to do that since THAAD is being placed primarily for the defense of the United States forces in Korea said Lee the Yonsei professor  Despite Moons inclination to oppose THAAD deployment he will not undo it at the expense of worsening ties with Trump just as Moon begins his term in office Lee saidLikewise it would be difficult to go back to the kind of sunshine policy of previous liberal presidents said Robert Kelly of Pusan National University I dont think there is much support for major engagement any more he saidThis is partly because public opinion has changed dramatically thanks to two North Korean attacks in 2010 that left more than 50 South Koreans dead as well as the Park governments assertion that engagement money was funding weapons developmentI think Moon would have to fight hard to get that kind of engagement off the ground  hed be pushing against the Americans and against his own people Kelly saidBut for South Koreans who wanted Park out there is a sense of opportunityToday is just the beginning said Kim Kyoung a housewife who attended every rally against the impeached president and returned to central Seoul on Friday night to celebrate Parks departure South Korea developed very quickly but now we have an opportunity to move slowly and help our democracy mature Congcong Zhang in Beijing contributed to this reportOnthe brand-new political news website the headlines could have been ripped from a speech by President Trump Immigrants commit more crime Syrian refugees are raping girls and Muslim education is taking over the school system But the two-month-old Gatestone Europe website is based in the Netherlands the contributors are Dutch And their aim their editor says is to swing the debate ahead of European elections this year to deliver a tide of anti-immigrant leaders to office in the Netherlands France Germany and elsewhereWebsites that focus on the perils of open borders immigration and international alliancesare expanding in scope and ambition in Europe seeing a once-in-a-generation opportunity to harness the energy from Trumps win to drive deep into a continent where traditional political parties are struggling Some of the websites are registered in Russia Others like Gatestone Europe are being supported by Americans with ties to TrumpIn the Netherlands someonline activists are backing a handful of anti-Muslim candidates including the fiery Geert Wilders who is running in a dead heat against the ruling party ahead of March15 elections In France news blogs are spreading innuendo about the rivals of the anti-immigrant Marine Le Pen who is the most popular presidential candidate in the lead-up to the election in April and May And in Germany some ofthe outlets have spread false stories about refugees raping people that were repeated by the Russian foreign minister Fed by public anger about refugees the Muslim-bashing Alternative for Germany party is poised to seize seats in Germanys Parliament in SeptemberTheres quite a lot of news quite shocking often with rape or violence and immigrants said Timon Dias 29 who started Gatestone Europe last month after several years of writing for a different anti-establishmentwebsite in the Netherlands We want people to learn whats happening in Europe and vote accordingly especially ahead of elections this yearAlthough many of the sites are small  the Amsterdam-based Gatestone Europe has only four writers and no office  they do not need to be well established to score big on Facebook or Twitter A spicy individual post can go viral with little regard for the history of the outletIts a crowbar in the system Dias said The main line is highly vigilant highly critical about what the effects are of having a significant Muslim minority in the inner cities The project is funded by the New York-based Gatestone Institute which is chaired by former UN ambassador John Bolton who was a finalist in Trumps search for a new national security adviserContacted for comment the Gatestone Institute made available one of its board members retired Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz who said that the organization is nonpartisan and that its aim is tomove the debate to the center Bolton did not reply to a request for commentAs with other similar sites many of Gatestones posts are based on true events spun aggressively to feed the narrative that mainstream pro-European Union politicians are selling out their countries to immigrants The site does not support any one candidate in the Dutch elections but the anti-EU leader of the small Forum for Democracy party Thierry Baudet is a contributorWe report the news to our readers in a directed way Dias saidAlthough Wilders is likely to face trouble forming a coalition and Le Pen is forecast to lose the second round of Frances presidential election both candidates have had success in shifting debate in their nations onto more anti-immigrant Euroskeptic ground Far-right websites are often their megaphoneIn the Netherlands similar news outlets have already made successful forays into Dutch political lifeA referendum last year on whether the Dutch government should ratify a trade deal with Ukraine was triggered by a far-right news site GeenStijlThe eventual rejection of the trade deal turned into an embarrassing defeat for the Dutch government which was forced to backpedal on its commitment to Ukraine Opponents of the trade deal including GeenStijl cited an opposition to EU expansion and a desire not to antagonize the Kremlin as reasons to vote it downPro-Ukraine-deal campaigners say they suspect that the Kremlin put a finger on the scale by supporting activists and pro-Russian trolls online although no link has been proved The activists including GeenStijl deny any connectionBut even absent ties to Russia the news sites demonstrated a powerful ability to disrupt the pro-EU agenda of the Dutch mainstream creating a political headache for Dutch leaders and feeding Western disunity that coincides with Kremlin effortsThe Ukraine referendum has shown what kind of mayhem they can cause said Cas Mudde a Dutch scholar of far-right movements at the University of Georgia What impressed a lot of people was their ability to mobilize people who were commenting on websites to go out and actually vote for a cause People werent expecting thatNow GeenStijls political arm GeenPeil  Dutch for no poll  has spun off into a political party and is contesting the parliamentary election on the promise to hold Dutch leaders accountableUntil my generation everybody had a better life than their parents That has stopped said Jan Dijkgraaf 54 a former journalist who is now the leader of GeenPeilHe said he did not consider himself a far-right politician but he seized on immigration as a major focus for Dutch votersDijkgraaf said he could understand if a mother of three needed temporary refuge from war But when there are boys of 25 with these kind of muscles you have to think are they really victims of a war or do they have plans to get rich or to do something like in Brussels or in ParisThe Ukraine referendum sparked a number of political parties most of which have struggled to break through Wilderss lock on anti-immigrant discourse in the NetherlandsWilders was using Twitter to spark outrage and publicity long before Trump turned to electoral politics A tweet last month of a leading political opponent Alexander Pechtold Photoshopped into a pro-sharia demonstration in London dominated political coverage for days Wilders later acknowledged that the photo was fake but said Pechtold had recently been to a similar demonstrationThey dont care about what is really true what is a little true or what is fake Pechtold said And thats of course what we have seen in the United StatesIn the far-right Web universe the faked picture caused no uproarIts a way of speaking to people said Bert Brussen editor of ThePostOnline another far-right website where headlines on recent articles have included Iraqis on Trial for Gang Rape in Vienna and Massacre by Islamic terror was again prevented in GermanyA lot of what Wilders says its Internet language Brussen said The Internet makes them stronger and they make the Internet strongerIn other countries with elections this year far-right sites are also thriving attracting the attention of some of the American outlets that helped propel Trump to victory Last year Breitbart News  whose former head Stephen K Bannon is now Trumps chief strategist  said that it would take the plunge into the French and German markets although there is so far little sign that it is readying to openBut anti-establishment activists in those countries may need little helpIn France where far-right candidate Le Pen wants to take a hard line against Muslim immigration hold a referendum on EU membership and embrace relations with the Kremlin far-right news sites have taken aim at whichever candidate appears most likely to challenge her in the final round of the presidential election due to be held May 7 (Le Pen is expected to win the first round)For months that was center-right candidate Franois Fillon More recently a surge from the centrist Emmanuel Macronhas drawn a volley of darts from rumor-mongering websites some of them branches of Russian state media Macron recently took on the rumors joking that his apparent ability tohave gay affairs puzzled his wife who is usually by his sideAnd in Germany and Austria experts say roughly 30 German-language alternative websites are currently operating Many have existed for years butthey have transformed into machines to undermine traditional politicians especially since the start of Europes refugee crisisThe majority of them experts say tend to have opaque ownership structures making it difficult to ascertain who is behind them They are almost universally pro-Russian in tone and some of the German-language sites areoperated from Russian servers though direct links to the Russian government are hard to findThey publish stories with a true core building their own atmosphere around this core what we call hybrid fake said Andre Wolf a spokesman for Mimikama an Austria-based fact-checking websiteMany stories seem aimed at undermining German Chancellor Angela Merkels bid for reelection on Sept24 But as a center-left challenger Martin Schulz rose in the polls in recent weeks along surged a flurry of fake reports  including one by the website AnonymousNewsru falsely claiming that his father once ran a Nazi concentration campAcross Europe Dias said the possibility of change is alivePeople feel the epicness of the times theyre living in he said Annabell Van den Berghe in Amsterdam Anthony Faiola in Berlin and James McAuley in Paris contributed to this reportTony Podesta a Democratic power lobbyist announced to colleagues Monday that he is stepping down amid a series of indictments that cast a shadow on work his firm had done with Paul Manafort that may have benefited a Ukrainian regime friendly to the Kremlin The Podesta Group is not named in the newly released indictments but the company is one of two indirectly referenced in the charges Podesta and another lobbying firm Mercury Public Affairs were working with Manafort and his partner Rick Gates from 2012-2014 in lobbying to improve the image of the Ukrainian government In the indictment the firms are referred to as Company A and Company B according to people familiar with the companies involvementManafort and Gates turned themselves in to federal authorities Monday while facing a 12-count indictment on various charges including misleading the government about their secret work for a foreign government  Later in the day Podesta announced his resignation at a staff meeting at the Podesta Groups Washington headquartersIt is impossible to run a public affairs firm while you are under attack by Fox News and the right wing media he told his former employees according to a person familiar with his remarks Podesta is the brother of John Podesta a longtime Democratic adviser who led the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton The resignation of one of Washingtons most prominent Democratic lobbyists shows how the investigation of special counsel Robert S Mueller III is reverberating throughout both partiesIts unclear how much the Podesta Group or its principal founder knew about the funding for the client they represented The Podesta Group and Mercury claimed in lobbying disclosure reports that they represented a Brussels-based nonprofit the European Center for a Modern Ukraine that sought to help Ukraine improve its image in the West from 2012 to 2014 However behind the scenes the lobbying work was being directed by Manafort and Gates prosecutors allege Their real client was the government of Ukraine the indictment says Gates and Manafort for many years represented the Party of Regions a Russia-friendly political organization in Ukraine that was led by Viktor Yanukovych former president of the Ukraine In 2012 Manafort and Gates solicited two Washington DC firms (Company A and Company B) to lobby in the US on behalf of Yanukovych and the Party of Regions and the Government of Ukraine  The Podesta Group fully disclosed its representation of the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine and complied with federal disclosure laws by filing under the lobbying disclosure act over five years ago said Molly Levinson a spokeswoman for the firm in a statement The Podesta Group has fully cooperated with the Special Counsels office and taken every possible step to provide documentation that confirms compliance with the law Based on our due diligence and on the recommendation of definitive legal experts the firm filed the appropriate public disclosures of its representation of the ECFMU over five years ago and in eight subsequent public filings The Podesta Groups work for ECFMU a nonprofit was in support of Ukraines admission to the EU a position supported by foreign policy experts at the time The ECFMU provided formal certification that it was neither funded by nor directed by a government or political party  A Mercury partner Michael McKeon issued a statement Monday afternoon acknowledging the firms representation of the Center Mercury worked for the ECFMU with the intention of aligning Ukraine with western democracies generally McKeon wrote Mercury retained a lawyer to determine the proper method of disclosure of such representation and followed the advice he said noting that the company has previously filed under lobbying and foreign-agents disclosure laws Mercury takes its obligations to follow all laws rules and regulations very seriously Mercury has and will continue to fully cooperate with the Office of the Special Counsel he wrote While claiming that the European Center for a Modern Ukraine was the client that organization was actually under the ultimate direction of the Government of Ukraine Yanukovych and the Party of Regions the indictment said  Company A and Company B were paid for their services not by their nominal client the Centre but solely through off-shore accounts associated with the Manafort-Gates entitiesThe Podesta Group and Mercury came into focus for prosecutors as they delved deeply into Manaforts finances earlier this yearThe way the South Korean government tells it North Korea is on the brink of collapse A collapse in no small part being brought about by the tough actions of the South Korean governmentBarely a week goes by without a report of cracks in Kim Jong Uns regime This weeks report concerns the alleged execution of a vice premier and the banishment of two other senior officialsA spokesman for South Koreas Unification Ministry said Wednesday that Kim Yong Jin who served as North Koreas education minister and then as a deputy prime minister  Why and when Inappropriate to say on both counts he saidBut Seoul confirmed his execution through various channels said the spokesman Jeong Joon-hee South Korean reports suggested that the vice premier was branded an anti-party and anti-revolutionary element and killed by firing squad in July after not standing upright at a meeting of the Supreme Peoples AssemblyAt the same time Jeong said that Kim Yong Chul a hard-liner in charge of inter-Korean relations and Choi Hui vice chief of the propaganda and agitation department were sent to the countryside for reeducationThis was the latest installment in Seouls narrative that Kim Jong Uns grip is weakeningPrevious chapters include the recent defection of the deputy North Korean ambassador in London because he was sick and tired of the system and reports that a North Korean official based in Southeast Asia and tasked with making money for the leadership had defected with bags of cash Add to that the mass defection of 13 workers from a North Korean restaurant in China  This all conveniently comes after President Park Geun-hyes administration in Seoul took surprisingly harsh steps to punish Pyongyang for its January nuclear test  in particular  then supporting tough international sanctionsThe South Korean president has been quick to draw a line linking all these events saying last week that serious cracks were appearing in North Korea and that elite defections could be a sign that the system is shakingBut South Korean intelligence has a record of being right as often as it is wrong  a  early this year showed up at a party congress in May  and of being used for political purposesSome analysts wonder whether thats what is happening nowI think its clear that when it suits the South Korean governments purposes information is shared with the media said Scott A Snyder a Korea expert at the Council on Foreign Relations So how reflective are these reports of whats happening in North Korea We dont always knowAlmost since the establishment of North Korea as a Soviet client state 70 years ago government officials and analysts have been predicting its imminent demiseWhile most analysts agree that sudden changes such as the latest ones probably reflect stresses within North Koreas senior ranks there is wide variation in interpretation Some say executions and purges are a sign of instability but others say they are a sign of strength because Kim Jong Un is consolidating his leadershipThe regime probably does face some pressures but the overall internal trajectory over the past three or four years has been one of consolidation and efforts to impose even higher tests of loyalty Snyder said Id say it was a sign of instability if disloyalty went unpunished  Totalitarian states like the one that Kim Jong Un inherited retain control through a reign of terror using executions and purges to keep the elite in line and more general repression and limits on information to keep the wider society under controlThe current leaders father Kim Jong Il executed more than 2000 officials between 1994 and 2000 said Cheong Seong-chang a respected North Korea-watcher at the Sejong Institute outside SeoulKim Jong Un has had about 130 officials put to death since he took over the helm of the country from his father almost five years ago according to a tally by South Koreas Yonhap News AgencyNotable among those executed are Kims own uncle Jang Sung Thaek put to death in 2013 for apparently amassing too much power and wealth and the   Kim Yong-hyun professor in North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul said that some shake-up was to be expected after Kim Jong Un held a Workers Party Congress in May the first since 1980A wide reshuffling of the North Korean elite has taken place as part of the process of building Kim Jong Uns system he said adding that the execution could have served as a warning to others in North Koreas top tierWhile high-level defections are embarrassing for Pyongyang and officials running off with money meant for the leadership will inflict some pain neither presents an existential threat for North Korea said Christopher Green a North Korea researcher at Leiden University in the NetherlandsAs with so many things about North Korea the present picture will be clear only with hindsight There could be cracks in the regime and it could be about to collapse but the thing is no one actually knows Green said Yoonjung Seo in Seoul contributed to this reportXandra Lammers lives on an island in Amsterdam the back door of her modern and spacious four-bedroom house opening onto a graceful canal where ducks swans and canoes glide byThe translation business she and her husband run from their home is thriving The neighborhood is booming with luxury homes going up as fast as workers can build them a quietly efficient tramway to speed residents to work in the world-renowned city center and parks bike paths art galleries beaches and cafes all within a short ambleBy outward appearances Lammers is living the Dutch dream But in the 60-year-olds telling she has been dropped into the middle of a nightmare one in which Western civilization is under assault from the Muslim immigrants who have become her neighborsThe influx has been too much The borders should close said Lammers soft-spoken with pale blue eyes and brown hair that frames a deceptively serene-looking face If this continues our culture will cease to existTo Europes powers that be the threat looks dramatically different but no less grave If enough voters agree with Lammers and support the far right in elections here on Wednesday and then its modern Europe itself  defined by cooperation openness and multicultural pluralism  that could come crashing down  The stakes have risen sharply as Europeans anti-establishment anger has swelled In interviews across the Netherlands in recent days far-right voters expressed stridently nationalist anti-immigrant views that were long considered fringe but that have now entered the Dutch mainstreamVoters young and old rich and poor urban and rural said they would back the Geert Wilders-led Freedom Party  no longer the preserve of the left-behinds  which promises to solve the countrys problems by shutting borders closing mosques and helping to dismantle the European UnionTheyve found a very powerful narrative said Koen Damhuis a researcher at the European University Institute who studies the far right By creating a master conflict of the national versus the foreign theyre able to attract support from all elements of societyAlong the way Europes old assurances have been swept aside The far right may exist the continents political establishment has long told itself but a virtuous brew of growing economic prosperity increased cross-border integration and rising education levels would blunt its appeal Most important all the pungent memory of the nationalist rights last turn in power would keep it from ever gaining control in Europe againBut in 2017 every one of those assumptions is being challenged  perhaps even explodedAfter the transatlantic jolts of and Donald Trump last year continental Europe is bracing for a possible string of paradigm-rattling firsts in its postwar history  In France has a credible shot at a triumph in spring presidential elections In Germany appears poised to win seats in the national parliament this fall And here in the Netherlands a man convicted only months ago of hate speech could wind up on top when votes are counted in next weeks national electionsAt first glance the Netherlands  a small nation of 17million that has long punched above its weight on the global stage through seafaring exploration and trade  seems an unlikely setting for a populist revoltUnlike in France where the economy continues to stagger nearly a decade on from the global financial crisis the indicators in the Netherlands are broadly positive falling unemployment healthy growth and relatively low inequality By most measures the Dutch are some of the happiest people on EarthAnd unlike Germany where Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the countrys borders to a historic influx of refugees in 2015 the Netherlands has been relatively insulated from mass immigration Compared with its neighbors the Dutch took significantly fewer asylum seekers during the refugee crisis and much of the countrys nonnative population settled in the Netherlands decades agoThose differences make it all the more surprising that the far rights message resonates here and hint at just how difficult it could be to halt the global populist waveFor much of the past two years Wilderss Freedom Party has led the polls though it has recently dropped into a virtual tie with the ruling center rightBecause of the deeply fragmented nature of Dutch politics  there will be 28 parties on the ballot Wednesday  the Freedom Party could come out on top with just 20percent of the vote Even if it does it is considered extremely unlikely that Wilders would end up governing because other parties have spurned himBut he has already had an outsize influence forcing rival politicians  including the prime minister Mark Rutte  to shift their policies and rhetoric in his directionTo many Wilders supporters the overall picture of a growing economy with a comparatively small number of recent immigrants is beside the point Their reasons for backing the platinum-haired politician  who refers to Moroccans as scum and advocates a total ban on Muslim immigration  run much deeperThe main issue is identity said Joost Niemller a journalist and author who has written extensively on Wilders and is sympathetic to his cause People feel theyre losing their Dutch identity and Dutch society The neighborhoods are changing Immigrants are coming in And they cant say anything about it because theyll be called racist So they feel helpless Because they feel helpless they get angryAnd today that anger can be found far beyond the poorer less-educated working-class areas where Wilders and his party first gained substantial supportI hear it on the tennis court and at the golf club People dont want immigrants said Geert Tomlow a former Freedom Party candidate who fell out with Wilders but still sympathizes with many of his positions One-third of Holland is angry Were angry We dont want all these changesThat is true even in places where little seems to have changedTeunis Den Hertog a 34-year-old small-business owner lives in a pastoral town that he said is virtually untouched by immigration Ive heard theres a Turkish man who lives here  but just outside the town thankfully he saidNonetheless Den Hertog said he wants the government to close the country to new arrivals and reestablish compulsory border checks for the first time in decadesYou can see a vehicle coming with a lot of men with dark skin and pick them out said Den Hertog who grew up poor and one of nine children but now earns enough to afford a comfortable suburban-style house for his family of four Otherwise its just too dangerousDen Hertog said he typically avoids the countrys diverse cosmopolitan cities But Wilders supporters exist there too as Lammers  the Amsterdam island resident  can attest  University-educated financially successful and raised in the culturally progressive firmament of the Netherlands biggest city Lammers had long staked her ground on the left Her father was a regional mayor from the Labour Party and she identified as a supporter well into adulthoodI was very politically correct she said I believed in the social experimentIt was a move up the social ladder that precipitated her shift across the political spectrumIn 2005 she and her husband bought their home in the Amsterdam neighborhood of IJburg an innovative development built on a cluster of artificial islandsLike many who moved to the neighborhood Lammers and her husband did so because the area offered bigger houses at lower prices than could be found in the crammed city center And at first it was everything they had hopedIt had a village feeling Everyone knew each other They put a temporary supermarket in a tent she recalled It was cozyBut then came a surprise Families of Moroccan and Turkish origin started moving in part of a social program to dedicate 30percent of the developments housing to people on low incomes the disabled or the elderlySuddenly she said white Dutch residents had to share their streets gardens and elevators with Muslim women wearing headscarves and men sporting beards Crime noise and litter soon intruded on her urban idyll she saidThe newcomers generally spoke Dutch and many seemed to work But she faulted them for not integrating the evidence of which she said could be found in their traditional dress and attendance at a modest storefront mosqueShe suggested they try church instead though Lammers said she does not attend (Sometimes on Sunday I watch American church on the television Lammers said Theyre very opposed to Islam I like that)If the newcomers have hurt her neighborhoods desirability its not apparent in the home prices which have sharply risen Nor is it visible on the streets which are clean tidy and on a mild late winters day filled with children of various ethnic backgrounds happily riding scooters and bikes But Lammers remains bitterYou think youre going to live in a well-to-do neighborhood she said But you end up living in a so-called black neighborhood because of the socialist ideologyAmong the beneficiaries of that ideology is one of Lammerss friends Ronald Meulendijks a 44-year-old who has been living on full-time medical disability since he was 29The government pays him the equivalent of $1000 a month and provides him with a steep discount on a light-filled three-bedroom apartment in the heart of IJburg  benefits he said he deserves as a native-born Dutchman with a long pedigreeMy whole family of seven generations paid taxes he saidMuslim immigrants and their children by contrast are undeserving he saidWhen I see all the refugees getting everything for free I get very angry I want to throw something at the television said Meulendijks who dotes on his pair of chow-chow rescue dogs and serves visitors to his art-filled apartment copious tea and strawberry pie A government has to treat its own people correctly before accepting new ones First you must take care of your ownAnd if the government fails Meulendijks has dark visions of whats to comeI think Holland will need a civil war he said between the people who dont belong here and the real peopleTo drive home the point Meulendijks has decorated his panoramic windows with five large posters bearing the face of Wilders and his partys campaign slogan The Netherlands is ours againA pronounced nick in the glass  the result of a carefully aimed rock  suggests not everyone in the neighborhood agrees with Meulendijkss clash-of-civilizations worldviewNeighbors said they did not recognize the grim vision of IJburg that Lammers and Meulendijks describedWhich country you come from or which religion you have it doesnt matter here said Iris Scheppingen 41 a resident for the past decade who is raising three children in IJburg The children all play togetherAt a nearby halal pizza restaurant  one of the neighborhoods few businesses that explicitly cater to Muslim customers  the owner said the area was safe and quiet He said he had never noticed a cultural clashNice people here said 49-year-old Farhad Salimi as his staff of young kitchen workers slung pies and sprinkled toppings Everyone comes here for pizza Immigrants Dutch people Everybody We dont have problemsThe world however was a different storyA refugee from Iran who moved to the Netherlands nearly 30 years ago Salimi said he had seen what religious zealotry and the politics of exclusion did to his native landNow the gray-haired Salimi fears it is happening across the West even in the peaceful and prosperous country that had so enthusiastically welcomed himThe politicians are exploiting divisions turning people against one another for their own gain he said Extremism is rising Where will it endEverywhere he said solemnly is messed up Karla Adam in London contributed to this reportAs Donald Trump surged in the Republican primary polls in the early months of 2016 his outsider campaign faced growing pressure to show that the former reality-TV star and noted provocateur was forming a coherent and credible world view So when Carter Page an international businessman with an office near Trump Tower volunteered his services former officials recall Trump aides were quick to make him feel welcomeHe had come with a referral from the son-in-law of Richard Nixon New York state Republican Party Chairman Ed Cox who had conveyed Pages interest to the campaign Cox saidA top Trump adviser Sam Clovis then employed what campaign aides now acknowledge was their go-to vetting process  a quick Google search  to check out the newcomer He seemed to have the right qualifications according to former campaign officials  head of an energy investment firm business degree from New York University doctorate from the University of LondonPage was in He joined a new Trump campaign national security advisory group and in late March 2016 the candidate pointed to Page among others as evidence of a foreign policy team with gravitasBut what the Google search had not shown was that Page had been on the FBIs radar since at least 2013 when Russian officials allegedly tried to use him to get information about the energy businessBy the summer of 2016 Page who had been recently named as a Trump adviser was under surveillance by FBI agents who suspected that he may have been acting as an agent of the KremlinAs part of its broader investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government the FBI continues to examine how Page joined the campaign and what conversations he may have had with Russian officials about the effort to interfere with the election  with or without the knowledge of Trump and his team  according to people familiar with the matterThe Senate Intelligence Committee has also zeroed in on Page asking him for records of all his contacts with Russians during the campaign all financial interactions he had with Russia and all communications he had with Trump campaign staffThe circumstances that led to Pages easy access to the Trump campaign represent one of the main questions facing investigators Were Trumps connections to multiple Russia-friendly advisers mere coincidence or evidence of a coordinated attempt to collude with a foreign government Or were they the result of incompetent vetting that left a neophyte candidate vulnerable to influence from people with nefarious agendasRegardless of the answer the campaigns previously unreported procedures for vetting Page and other advisers are greatly complicating matters for Trumps presidency Along with Page a number of other Trump associates are under growing scrutiny by congressional investigators and the FBI as they examine potential ties between the campaign and Moscow including former national security adviser Michael Flynn onetime campaign chairman Paul Manafort and informal Trump adviser Roger StoneThis week former CIA director John Brennan told the House Intelligence Committee that in 2016 he had seen intelligence revealing contacts and interactions between Russian officials and US persons involved in the Trump campaign that I was concerned about because of known Russian efforts to suborn such individuals He did not name the individuals but said that when he stepped down as CIA director on Jan 20 he had unresolved questions about whether the Russians had been successful in getting campaign associates to work on their behalf in a witting or unwitting fashionMultiple people familiar with campaign operations most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations said that Page and others were brought into the fold at a time of desperation for the Trump team As Trump was starting to win primaries he was under increasing pressure to show that he had a legitimate presidential-caliber national security team The problem he faced was that most mainstream national security experts wanted nothing to do with himEveryone did their best but there was not as much vetting as there could have been former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski saidAnother longtime campaign official put it this way Anyone who came to us with a pulse a rsum and seemed legit would be welcomedWe were not exactly making due diligence the highest priority another campaign veteran addedA White House spokeswoman referred questions to Trumps campaign Michael Glassner who currently serves as manager of Trumps campaign committee declined to commentPage and Trump aides have said that Page never met Trump and Page left the campaign in August 2016 Page has denied working on behalf of the Russians and said questions about his Moscow ties are part of a political witch hunt designed by Democrats to discredit TrumpPage has for months declined to answer questions about how he joined the Trump team and who invited him aboard calling the matter irrelevant in an email exchange with The Washington PostIn a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod J Rosenstein last week Page wrote that he had been an informal unpaid member of one of [Trumps] campaign committeesIn his defense Page in recent weeks has sent a series of meandering letters to investigators He has quoted Maroon5 lyrics cited the writings of George Orwell and said he is being persecuted because of his Catholic faithIn a letter sent Wednesday to the House Intelligence Committee Page referred to himself as an unpaid informal member of the Make America Great Again movement a reference to Trumps campaign slogan and said he had been illegitimately swept up into this investigation based on false evidence and propagandaPages entry to the campaign came as Trump was starting to win Republican primaries and take commanding leads in GOP polls  but was also facing criticism for his lack of foreign policy advisersIn early March 2016 more than 70 conservative national security experts signed an open letter opposing Trumps candidacy calling him fundamentally dishonest Trump announced that then-Sen Jeff Sessions (R-Ala) the only senator supporting him would chair a foreign policy panel for the campaign  but no other members of the panel were named publiclyWhen the hosts of MSNBCs Morning Joe pressed Trump on air in mid-March to name people with whom he spoke about foreign affairs the candidates response only seemed to underscore his lack of serious adviceIm speaking with myself number one because I have a very good brain he saidAs the campaign maneuvered behind the scenes to expand its ranks Page had at least one built-in advantage when he joined the Trump campaign geographic proximityHe ran a company Global Energy Capital LLC with offices located a block from Trump Tower and connected by an atrium to the famed propertySome campaign veterans speculated that Page may have stepped forward on his own essentially walking into campaign headquarters and introducing himself without a referral  a frequent occurrence at Trump Tower in those early daysLast week Page rejected this version of events Wrong again he told The Post via text message At least one other primary person(s) involvedOn Thursday after Cox described his role Page confirmed that the New York GOP chairman had connected him to the Trump campaignCox said in an interview that Page an acquaintance from business and political circles had reached out to him in early 2016 expressing interest in joining the Trump campaign Cox said he routinely connected potential volunteers with GOP campaigns He described Page as very informed and up to date on thingsSeveral former officials recall that when Page first showed up at Trump Tower Lewandowski introduced him to other campaign aides Lewandowski said he could not remember the encounter which was first reported by the Daily Caller but also did not rule it outClovis who assembled and vetted the list of national security advisers that included Page declined to comment Now a top official at the Agriculture Department Clovis had worked on Russia-related issues at the Pentagon in the 1980s and as a candidate for US Senate in Iowa in 2014 had questioned the effectiveness of sanctions imposed after Russias incursion into UkraineRepresentatives for Flynn Sessions and Jared Kushner Trumps senior adviser declined to comment A White House official said senior policy adviser Stephen Miller also a key campaign staffer at the time had no role in the formation of the foreign policy groupA thorough vetting of Page might have revealed several red flags Page had spent three years working in Moscow for instance and he held stock in the Russian company Gazprom meaning that he could have a personal financial stake in the future of US-imposed sanctions against RussiaPage wrote in a September letter to then-FBI Director James B Comey that he had sold his de minimis equity investment in the Russian company at a loss a month earlierPage had previously drawn the attention of the FBI after he had conversations in 2013 with a man posing as an executive with the New York branch of the Russian development bank Vnesheconombank The man was later convicted of being a Russian spy and FBI recordings included discussions among Russian operatives about their attempts to recruit Page Page has said that he cooperated with the FBI and that the only crime related to the incident is that US government officials appear to have recently revealed his role to the mediaBy late March 2016 when Trump appeared before The Posts editorial board he was prepared to brag about his new foreign policy teamI can give you some of the names Trump said after Post Publisher Frederick J Ryan Jr asked about his advisersSecond on the list of five read aloud by Trump Carter Page PhDAnother unusual name on Trumps list of foreign policy experts was a little-known figure named George Papadopoulos whose inclusion may also have demonstrated the vulnerabilities that came with limited vettingHes an energy consultant Trump said Excellent guyThe news media soon reported that Papadopoulos seemed to have exaggerated elements of his rsum And touting his position as a Trump adviser Papadopoulos began offering positive comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin to foreign audiencesPapadopoulos did not respond to requests for comment His name had surfaced four months earlier on a similar list of foreign policy advisers circulated by the presidential campaign of Ben CarsonBarry Bennett who served as Carsons campaign manager and later as an adviser to Trump recalled that he was surprised when Trump named Papadopoulos to his teamHe was someone who worked for me at the Carson campaign for like 15 minutes And somehow he was on the list Bennett said of his reaction to the Trump roster I was like how in the hell did that happenTrump soon added a few names to the group and held a formal briefing with its members in a conference room at his not-yet-opened hotel in Washington A photo of that session distributed by Trump on social media  meeting with my national security team Trump wrote  showed the candidate at the head of the table and Sessions at the opposite endPapadopoulos could be seen at the table Page was not there and Trump officials have said that Trump never met Page during his five-month stint as an adviser People involved with the campaign recall that Page attended other meetings that the group held in Washington including one attended by Sessions He also submitted policy memos for the campaigns review a former campaign adviser saidIn June Page stunned a group of foreign policy luminaries during a private meeting at Blair House with the visiting prime minister of India by going off-topic to declare that Putin was a stronger and more reliable leader than President Barack Obama according to people who were in the room Page also promised that US-Russian relations would improve if Trump were elected Page has denied this account blaming it on his political enemiesThe next month Page delivered a speech at a Russian university in which he was highly critical of US policy Page has said he met with no Russian government officials during the trip except for briefly greeting a deputy prime minister who attended the eventOver the summer the FBI convinced a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of Russia law enforcement and other US officials Pages name also appeared in a now-famous dossier which quietly circulated among reporters and alleged that there were links between Trump associates and the Kremlin The document asserted that Page met with top Russian officials to plot how to elect TrumpThe document which was compiled by a former British spy employed by Trumps political adversaries became public after the election and was dismissed by Trump and his allies as fake news Page vigorously rejects the allegation about him and said the FBI should spend its time investigating how the document came together instead of his activitiesPage used his Wednesday letter to the House Intelligence Committee to defend his contacts with the Russians Presenting the letter as a follow-up to Brennans testimony Page wrote that throughout my interactions with the Russians in 2016 I consistently made it crystal clear that all of my benign statements and harmless actions in Moscow as well as elsewhere overseas were solely made as a scholar and a business person speaking only on behalf of myself In other words in no way connected to then-candidate TrumpEarlier this month Page insisted in writing to the Senate Intelligence Committee that for all the attention he has received he did not once meet TrumpIn retrospect and with the 1984-inspired governance standards employed in 2016 Page wrote I consider it fortunate that I never briefed

Winston Churchill ordered at the height of World WarII and residents of this fish-and-chips enclave in the land of flamenco pamper their simian neighbors with meticulous care and feedingYet even as the colony of apes  tailless monkeys really  thrives in its home at the top of the Rock the 30000 Britons who live at the foot of the soaring limestone monolith are feeling nervousThey may not be going anywhere But thanks to Brexit Gibraltar is about to leave the European Union  giving Spain new impetus in its centuries-long quest to retake control of this strategically vital and economically prosperous territory Britains sole continental outpostTo the residents  who take their Britishness seriously  Spains suggestions that Gibraltar could be cut off from the rest of Europe unless it accepts at least partial Spanish sovereignty represent a serious threatGibraltar they say embodies the European ideal of shared prosperity through cross-border trade and movement But as European bonds fray those living here worry that the coupling of Brexit with Spanish threats could return Gibraltar to a painful pastInstead of feeding the goose that lays the golden egg Spain is trying to kill it said Ernest Tito Vallejo Smith a retired military man local historian and tour guide We dont know whats going to happen Were stuck in limboIn that respect Gibraltar has company Since to exit the EU the country has been locked in suspended animation awaiting the outcome of negotiations that will reshape virtually every aspect of its relationship with its European neighborsAs Gibraltars predicament shows untangling Britain from the EU will not be easy With the negotiations expected to begin this spring British Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that she will deliver results to a population demanding liberation from the Brussels bureaucracy and in particular greater freedom to limit migration into BritainBut she also will have to defend British financial interests which are heavily intertwined with the EU And she will need to look out for each of the United Kingdoms component parts some of which  Scotland Northern Ireland and Gibraltar voted against BrexitMeanwhile European negotiators will seek to use every bit of leverage to drive a hard bargain with their soon-to-be-former EU ally and to dissuade other wavering members from a rush to the exitsThe negotiations due to last two years could leave tiny Gibraltar especially vulnerable Its residents know this well and it helps to explain why 96percent of Gibraltarians who voted in the June referendum opted for remainUnlike its rainy island motherland some 1000 miles to the north sun-splashed Gibraltar relies on daily movement and trade across a European border to supply nearly half of its workforce and the vast majority of its resources And the country that controls that border is Spain  which gave Gibraltar away to Britain in a peace treaty more than 300 years ago and has wanted it back ever sinceWith the Brexit vote Spanish officials seemed to think their moment had finally come Within hours of the result then-Foreign Minister Jos Garca-Margallo declared that the time to plant the Spanish flag on the Rock was close at handLast fall Spain took its case to the United Nations arguing that Britains hold on Gibraltar represented an outdated relic of colonialismSpains position has slightly softened in recent weeks with the countrys new foreign minister acknowledging that Spain has little hope of regaining control as long as the British government and Gibraltar authorities refuse to budge But he also suggested that there will be consequences to Gibraltarians for a spurned Spanish offer of co-sovereigntyThey have a right to get left out of the EU if thats what they want Alfonso Dasits told the Spanish newspaper El Pas But if Gibraltar wants a relationship with the EU it will have to go through usTo longtime residents the implication is so clear it doesnt even need to be stated With Britain and Gibraltar out of the EU Spain could decide to sharply limit movement at the border choking off the territorys thriving economy which is built on financial services online gambling and e-commerceMost people here do not think Spanish authorities actually would go that far But as residents know from bitter experience it has been done beforeNever underestimate the lengths that the Spanish government will go to to damage Gibraltar said Edward Macquisten chief executive of the Gibraltar Chamber of Commerce Thats the lesson of our historyIndeed steady as the Rock of Gibraltar may be a familiar phrase worldwide but through millennia of war siege and disputed control this place has rarely been placidIts location  on a peninsula jutting into the Mediterranean with clear views of the African and European coasts plus the nine-mile-wide strait that bears Gibraltars name  has made it an incomparable military prize The Rock itself is a natural fortress its sheer walls deterring all but the most dogged invadersBut the same factors that made Gibraltar so coveted have also made it the object of damaging battles as the tunnels cannon batteries and pockmarked stone walls that litter the verdant Rock attestWith only one road in and out Gibraltar is also highly vulnerable to siege In 1969 the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco took advantage of that weakness abruptly closing the border The territory was cut off from supplies and deprived of workers Families divided by the separation were forced to shout news of births and deaths across a fence their words dying in the sea wind on particularly blustery daysThe border was not fully reopened for 16 years creating a bitter and lasting memoryWe dont want to go back to a situation of history revisiting itself said Jennifer Ballantine director of the Gibraltar Garrison Library It was painful enough the first timeChief Minister of Gibraltar Fabian Picardo insists that that is not going to happen  and that neither is any form of Spanish sovereignty an idea Gibraltarians emphatically rejected in a 2002 referendumThe people of France are French the people of Germany are German and the people of Gibraltar are British Picardo said in an interview in his handsome offices off Gibraltars Main Street which is lined with fruit-laden orange trees and red postal boxes bearing the seal of Queen Elizabeth IIBritains vote for Brexit Picardo said was a moment of deep sorrow in Gibraltar  because residents are committed Europeans and because they knew the vote to leave would give Spain leverageBut now that Britain has made its choice he said it is vital for the territory to retain access to the single European market and to preserve fluid movement for the 12000 workers who cross the border daily He said Britains government will fight for bothI have absolutely no doubt that London understands how important those issues are for Gibraltar and for the United Kingdom he saidBritish officials have for their part insisted that they will not submit to Spanish demands Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson made that clear in typically colorful fashion declaring that Britain would maintain an implacable marmoreal and rock-like resistance to any effort to weaken its control over GibraltarBut even so Gibraltars plucky residents are girding themselves for possible hard times The monkeys  Europes only free-range colony  are here to stay and so are the British But that doesnt mean life wont become roughThe Gibraltarian is a born survivor Weve been through sieges through wars through all kinds of bad times said Vallejo Smith the tour guide historian and lifelong resident who at 68 speaks from personal experience But somehow we always manage to come out afloat Karla Adam in London contributed to this reportWith the transatlantic relationship on the line European leaders are trying to put a brave face on Donald Trumps new world orderThey may hold the American president-elect in profound disdain a feeling many  But through gritted teeth they insist that the ties anchoring the globe since World War II will endure  if not with much warmth then at least through the sort of transactional relations Trump can understandThat theory however will be put to the test as tweets and interviews turn into policy and actionAfter decades of transatlantic relations based on a shared set of interests and values Europe is reckoning with what could happen if only one of those remainsIts where interests and values intersect where were going to find problems said Robin Niblett director of the London-based think tank Chatham House If our values stand for anything its open democratic societies and open markets If America moves away from those thats pretty fundamentalTrump supporters would undoubtedly say he is fully committed to democracy and capitalism But many Europeans view in his tweets and raucous rallies a fundamental shake-up of the values underpinning the liberal international orderAnalysts and former European officials say the list of potential flash points includes Russia Iran Israel and Palestine climate change democracy promotion and global tradeTo European leaders the gap goes beyond mere policy differencesThe president-elects determination to embrace adversarial autocrats such as Russian President Vladimir Putin even as he pointedly criticizes allied democrats such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel his threats to discard internationally agreed deals such as the Paris climate accord or the Iranian nuclear agreement his indifference to the fate of the European Union and dismissive approach toward NATO his apparent lack of concern about evidence of Russian interference in the US election and his oft-repeated jabs at free trade and the media all point to an Atlantic-size gulf between the new US commander in chief and the European establishment  Serious tensions have erupted between Europe and Washington before  think the freedom fries era when France and Germany rejected the Bush administrations march to war in Iraq But rarely have Europeans felt that fundamental values may be so deeply in oppositionWere getting into uncharted territory here where Europeans will have to strike a balance between a transatlantic relationship that remains intense and a deep fundamental disagreement on values and an interpretation of what democracy is about said Stefano Stefanini a former senior Italian diplomat who was his nations ambassador to NATO from 2007 to 2010It is difficult to know to what extent Trump will carry through on his foreign policy promises In confirmation hearings his cabinet nominees have at times with the man who selected them Analysts also note that Trumps promises are often contradictoryBut European nerves were  this week when Trump told interviewers from a British and a German newspaper that he thought more countries would follow Britain out of the EU that NATO was obsolete and that Merkel had made a catastrophic mistake by welcoming hundreds of thousands of refugeesThe sudden unpredictability of Europes most important global partner comes as the continent is deep in the throes of its own identity crisis reeling from the same populist shocks that brought Trump to power  the fall of Italys center-left prime minister and the emergence of  in Eastern Europe are all considered symptoms of the anti-establishment tide washing over the Western worldYet unlike in Washington as of Friday the establishment remains in charge in most European capitalsBut no one knows for how longWith elections looming this year in the Netherlands France and Germany far-right parties are making a concerted push to end the centrist consensus that has prevailed in Western Europe for generations That dynamic coupled with Trumps unpredictability makes it almost impossible to say what contours the US-European relationship will take Theres absolutely huge uncertainty over what kind of US administration Europe will find itself dealing with said Adam Thomson director of the European Leadership Network and a former British ambassador to NATO Theres also uncertainty for the Trump administration over what kind of Europe America will be dealing with  For the most part European leaders have tried to project confidence that the Trump era will be business as usual with shared interests in combating terrorism tamping crises and promoting economic growth overriding any differencesBritain with one foot out the door of the EU has been particularly keen to cultivate close ties and ensure its special relationship with Washington remains intactEuropes accommodating response reflects how internally divided it has become and how little power it has relative to Washington The United States spends vastly more on defense than Europe  nearly three times as much as all European members of NATO combinedTrump has demanded that NATO allies pay their own way while raising questions about whether he would come to members defense in the event of an attack His closest European ally is neither British prime minister Theresa May nor Merkel but  the bomb-throwing Brexit champion who wants Britains departure to be the trigger event in the EUs ultimate collapseThere has never been an American president who did not support European integration Its a first A tragedy for Europe Stefanini saidDespite European division and weakness leaders could be left with little choice but to distance themselves from Trump if he follows through on pledges considered antithetical to European valuesA ban on Muslim immigration a resumption of the use of torture or an end to American participation in the Paris climate accord  all Trump campaign promises  would undoubtedly elicit strongly negative reactions in EuropeBut perhaps most critical will be his handling of two of the Wests adversaries Russia and IranTrump appears determined to improve ties with Putin just three years after Russian military intervention in Ukraine prompted the United States and Europe to impose sanctionsIn theory much of Europe would welcome a lowering of tensions between Russia and the West said Thomson the former British ambassador But the details will be criticalIts important for Europeans that this is not seen as some kind of sellout to Russia and that theres not a US-Russia deal done over European heads Thomson said On Iran too the maneuvering will be extremely delicate Trump has repeatedly attacked as a really really bad deal the  negotiated in 2015 between Iran and six of the worlds leading powers  the United States the United Kingdom France Germany Russia and China Any Trump move to unilaterally pull the United States out risks antagonizing every other party to the agreement Critics say it could also undermine global faith in Washingtons commitment to live up to its promises  If Europe is going to effectively counter Trump however it will have to stay united And it is far from clear that it can   The declaration was a signal not only to Trump but to her own voters ahead of an election in which she faces the likelihood of a far-right anti-immigrant party capturing seats in the Parliament for the first timeA lot of thinking in Berlin is already going into how we will have to reckon with Trump in actions he takes strategically or actions he takes that impact the Western liberal order said Daniela Schwarzer head of the German Council on Foreign RelationsBut there are limits to how far Germany can goEven if Germany is willing to take the lead it needs to work with others And this is a messy picture Schwarzer saidWith Britain focused on its EU exit London is unlikely to take a stand against Trump unless it is forced to do so Europes other major power France has its own struggles as it prepares for spring presidential elections in which a far-right party stands a chance of victoryWhoever wins French policy analysts said they feared their country was entering a new era of ties with WashingtonIn many ways its not so much what America will do but in a way what America has become said Dominique Moisi a co-founder of the French Institute for International Relations Its essence as much as its performance We dont know what the performance is going to be but we have an inkling that the essence of America has changed Birnbaum reported from Brussels and McAuley from ParisRobert S Mueller III was greeted with near universal praise when he was appointed to lead the investigation into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election but as he builds his special counsel team his every hire is under scrutinyAt least seven of the 15 lawyers Mueller has brought on to the special counsel team have donated to Democratic political candidates five of them to Hillary Clinton  a fact that President Trump and his allies have eagerly highlighted These critics also point to some of the lawyers history working with clients connected to the Clintons and Muellers long history with former FBI director  as they question whether those assigned to the investigation can be impartialMany lawyers and ethics experts say they can see no significant legal or ethical concerns with the teams political giving or past work and they note that Trump often misstates the facts as he casts aspersions But others say the optical problem is a real one that threatens to undermine public confidence in the probe  In my view prosecutors who make political contributions are identifying fairly strongly with a political party said William P Barr who served as attorney general under George HW Bush I would have liked to see him have more balance on this groupCriticizing those conducting an investigation is not a new tactic Democrats famously  in the crosshairs during his examination of President Bill Clinton And by raising questions about the investigators early legal analysts said Trump is laying the groundwork to question any results that are not to his likingBy staking out the position of partisanship through campaign contributions the president simply is setting a stage for a public relations assault down the road said Jacob Frenkel a defense lawyer at Dickinson Wright who previously worked in the now-defunct Office of the Independent CounselTrump hascalled the special counsels investigation the single greatest  in American political history adding that it was led by some very bad and conflicted people In a more recent  the president said that Mueller was very very good friends with Comey which is very bothersome and that the people that have been hired are all Hillary Clinton supporters some of them worked for Hillary ClintonI mean the whole thing is ridiculous if you want to know the truth from that standpoint Trump said But Robert Muellers an honorable man and hopefully hell come up with an honorable solutionAsked if Mueller would have to recuse himself he said Were going to have to seeTrump supporters have raised similar concerns Former Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich  that Republicans were delusional if they think the special counsel is going to be fair The pro-Trump group Great America Alliance  in which conservative commentator Tomi Lahren opined Only in Washington could a rigged game like this be called independentBut Attorney General  a strong Trump backer who has recused himself from the Russia probe was more circumspect  on FridayMr Mueller is entitled lawfully I guess at this point to hire who he desires but I think he should look for people who have strength and credibility by all people Sessions saidPressed on whether he had confidence in Mueller Sessions said I feel confident in what hell do Thats all I can say to you about thatMueller has brought in 15 attorneys to work with him  among them former colleagues at the firm WilmerHale and veteran Justice Department lawyers said Peter Carr a spokesman for the Special Counsels Office Only 13 have been publicly identifiedPut together the team is a formidable collection of legal talent and expertise with experience prosecuting national security fraud and public corruption cases arguing matters before the Supreme Court and assessing complicated legal questionsThe team members include a Justice Department deputy solicitor general who has argued more than 100 cases before the Supreme Court the chief of the Justice Departments fraud section  who worked as an assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force and  a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel who also came from WilmerHaleRhee was on the team representing the Clinton Foundation and another lawyer working with the special counsel  once represented Clinton aide

case where a prosecutor has been removed because of a political donation  Quarless donations were the most substantial Over two decades he gave more than $30000 to various Democratic campaigns

the teams workTheres a bipartisan consensus that the various wild conflicts allegations that have been made by Trump and his allies are groundless said Norm Eisen a fellow at the Brookings Institution who served as Obamas ethics czar It just is not the case that lawyers or investigators are disqualified by political activity of this kindTrump and his allies have also fixated on the longtime professional relationship between Mueller and Comey but the president might be overstating their relationshipThe two men played central roles in a 2004 incident during the George W Bush administration

congenial relationship as former colleagues Both served long legal careers that involved overlapping time spent within the Department of Justice and thats pretty well documented But beyond that theyre not close personal friends Kelley said Theyre friends in the sense that co-workers are friends They dont really have a personal relationshipKelley said Comey had never been to Muellers home and Mueller had never been to Comeys home He said they had lunch together once and dinner together twice  once with their spouses and once after Comey became FBI director so Mueller could brief him on the job Once in 2004 with two others from the Justice Department they played golf together Kelley saidKelley said Deputy Attorney General knew of Mueller and Comeys relationship before naming Mueller as

Bush began phoning foreign capitals to reassure allies startled by Pyongyangs surprising feat The test aides said had been mostly a failure a botched 1-kiloton cry for attention from a regime that had no warheads or reliable delivery systems and would never be allowed to obtain themThe current course that they are on is unacceptable State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said publicly at the time and the international community is going to actA decade later that confidence has all but evaporated After a week in which Pyongyang successfully lobbed  into the Sea of Japan US officials are no longer seeing North Koreas weapons tests as amateurish attention-grabbing provocations Instead they are viewed as evidence of a rapidly growing threat  and one that increasingly defies solutionOver the past year technological advances in North Koreas nuclear and missile programs have dramatically raised the stakes in the years-long standoff between the United States and the reclusive communist regime according to current and former US officials and Korea experts Pyongyangs growing arsenal has rattled key US allies and spurred efforts by all sides to develop new first-strike capabilities increasing the risk that a simple mistake could trigger a devastating regional war the analysts saidThe military developments are coming at a time of unusual political ferment with a new and largely untested administration in Washington and with South Koreas government coping with an  Longtime observers say the risk of conflict is higher than it has been in years and it is likely to rise further as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un seeks to fulfill his pledge to field long-range missiles capable of striking US citiesThis is no longer about a lonely dictator crying for attention or demanding negotiations said Victor Cha a former adviser on North Korea to the Bush administration and the Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies a Washington think tank This is now a military testing program to acquire a proven capability  Pyongyangs ambition to become an advanced nuclear-armed state is not new North Korea began building its first reactor for making plutonium more than three decades ago Over the years it has shown ingenuity in increasing the range and power of a stockpile of homemade short- and medium-range missiles all based on Soviet-era designsOften in the past the new innovations have been accompanied by demands a clamoring for security guarantees and international respect by a paranoid and nearly friendless government that perceives its democratic neighbors as plotting its destruction After the first atomic test in 2006 then-leader Kim Jong Il threatened to launch nuclear missiles unless Washington agreed to face-to-face talksNorth Korea has been slammed instead with ever-tighter  meant to cut off access to technology and foreign cash flows Yet despite the trade restrictions diplomatic isolation threats and occasional sabotage the countrys weapons programs have continued their upward march goaded forward by dictators willing to sacrifice their citizens well-being to grow the countrys military mightAnd now in the  progress is coming in leapsPyongyangs  occurred on Sept9 on the 68th anniversary of North Koreas founding Seismic monitoring stations picked up vibrations from the underground blast and quickly determined that this one was exceptionalScientific analyses of the test determined that the new bombs explosive yield approached 30kilotons two times the force of the Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima Japan in 1945 The device was twice as powerful as the bomb North Korea tested just nine months earlier and it was 30times stronger than one detonated in 2006 in a remote mountain tunnel More ominously North Korea last March displayed a new compact bomb one that appears small enough to fit inside the nose cone of one of its indigenously produced missilesRegardless of whether the miniature bomb is real or a clever prop North Korea does finally appear to be on the verge of a nuclear breakout said Robert Litwak an expert on nuclear proliferation and director of International Security Studies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars He said Pyongyangs arsenal is believed to now contain as many as 20 nuclear bombs along with enough plutonium and highly enriched uranium to make dozens moreWhen I got into this field Litwak said at a symposium on North Korea this month I couldnt have conceived of North Korea acquiring a nuclear arsenal approaching half the size of Great BritainsThe countrys missiles also have grown more sophisticated Last year North Koreas military conducted the first test of a   a significant advance over the countrys existing liquid-fueled rockets because they can be moved easily and launched quickly Also in 2016 North Korea broadcast images of engineers testing engines for a new class of advanced missiles with true intercontinental range potentially putting cities on the US mainland within reachThe provocations have continued in the weeks since the inauguration of President Trump who just before taking office appeared to taunt Pyongyang in a Twitter post saying that North Koreas plan for building intercontinental ballistic missiles A month later Kim launched one of the countrys new solid-fuel missiles interrupting  with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Last weeks coordinated launch of four intermediate-range missiles appeared intended to showcase the countrys ability to fire multiple rockets simultaneously at US military bases in Japan increasing the likelihood that some will penetrate antimissile shieldsNorth Koreas state-run media has occasionally shown propaganda footage of Kim huddling with his generals over what some analysts have jokingly called the map of death a chart that portrays Japanese and US mainland cities as potential targetsThe laughter has now stopped said Jeffrey Lewis an expert on North Korean weapons systems This idea that these things were just bargaining chips  something that was true years ago  is superseded by the fact that there is now a rocket force  with a commander and a headquarters and subordinate bases all with missiles said Lewis director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies This is now a living breathing thingThere have been notable failures as well Numerous test rockets have drifted far off course and others never made it off the launchpad Many analysts say it could still be several years before Kim can construct a true ICBM that could reliably reach the US mainland and perhaps longer before he can demonstrate an ability to incorporate a nuclear payload into his rocket design Yet already the basic components for a future arsenal of long-range nuclear-tipped missiles are in place Lewis saidThe ICBM program is real Lewis said Theyve showed us their static engine test They showed us the mock-up of the nuclear warhead They have done everything short of actually testing the ICBM When they do test it the first time it will probably fail But eventually it will work And when it works people are going to freak outFor decades the United States and its East Asian allies have tried an array of strategies to blunt North Koreas progress ranging from diplomacy to covert operations to defensive antimissile shields Lately the search for solutions has taken on an intensity not seen in yearsAs diplomatic initiatives have stalled US Japanese and South Korean officials have broadened the search for measures to ensure that Pyongyangs missiles remain grounded or  in the event of a launch  can be brought down before they reach their target The efforts have proved to be partly successful at bestThree years ago alarmed by North Koreas advances on missile systems the Obama administration ordered the Pentagon and intelligence agencies to deploy highly classified cyber and electronic measures against North Korea largely aimed at undermining the countrys nuclear and missile programs two former senior administration officials said Aspects of the initiatives were described in  The effort was further intensified last year the officials said in response to new intelligence assessments showing North Korea inching closer to its goal of fielding long-range ballistic missiles  The clandestine effort begun under President Barack Obama appears to have borne fruit judging from a rash of missile failures in the past year said one former official familiar with the program The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the secret operationsWere stopping shipments Were making sure things dont work the way theyre supposed to one former official said Weve been able to delay things in some cases probably by a lot Its a cat-and-mouse gameBut the second official familiar with the Pentagons cyberwarfare efforts acknowledged that North Korea remains an exceptionally difficult target because of its isolation and limited digital infrastructure The official suggested that at least some of the recent missile failures were probably caused by North Korean errors I would be wary of claiming too much he saidWe were trying to use all the tools that were available to us in order to degrade as much of their capabilities as possible a second former official said But we just did not have nearly as much game as we should haveIn handoff meetings with Trump Obama described the gathering threat in stark terms calling it the most serious proliferation challenge facing the new administration according to aides familiar with the discussions The Trump White House has since convened three deputies committee meetings on North Korea and ordered a new top-to-bottom threat assessment White House officials say that Trump is weighing all options from a new diplomatic initiative to enhanced military capabilities possibly including a highly controversial return of tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea for the first time since the early 1990sThe administration is dispatching Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to East Asia this week to confer with counterparts in Beijing Tokyo and Seoul And the White House is defending its decision last week to send antimissile batteries to South Korea despite vehement opposition from ChinaThe initiatives have failed to calm tensions in the region As more missiles streak across North Koreas eastern coast Japanese and South Korean officials are pledging increased investments in defensive shields and highly accurate conventionally armed missiles designed to preemptively destroy North Korean launch sites and command centers if an attack seems imminent North Korea has responded with similar threats describing its recent missile launches as a dry run for a preemptive  the presumed staging ground for forces preparing to come to South Koreas aid if war breaks outIn the past such a strike would be seen as suicidal as it would certainly result in a devastating counterattack against North Korea that would probably destroy the regime itself But Kim is betting that an arsenal of long-range nuclear-tipped missiles would serve as an effective deterrent said Cha the former Bush administration adviserThats why they want to be able to reach the continental United States so they can effectively hold us hostage Cha said Do we really want to trade Los Angeles for whatever city in North KoreaSuch an attack on the US mainland is not yet within North Koreas grasp and US officials hope they can eventually neutralize the threat with improvements in antimissile systems But in the meantime each new advance increases the chance that a small mishap could rapidly escalate into all-out war Cha said In a crisis everyone is put in a use-it-or-lose-it situation in which everyone feels he has to go first he saidThe growing danger now he said is miscalculation Ellen Nakashima contributed to this reportTensions between Republicans and Democrats over the investigation of Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election intensified Sunday with President Trump demanding to know why his campaign is under federal scrutiny while his former opponent Hillary Clinton is not The presidents latest outburst over the inquiry led by special counsel Robert S Mueller III surfaced on Twitter as his administration braced for the possibility that the first batch of charges in the case could be publicly announced as soon as Monday  that a federal grand jury had approved an indictment although details of the possible charges and the name of a defendant remained unclearTrump issued four tweets over 24 minutes attacking the Mueller probe as unfair and citing various Clinton controversies that he said warranted investigation Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia collusion which doesnt exist the president said The Dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) Witch Hunt for evil politics but the Rs are now fighting back like never before There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton and now the facts are pouring out DO SOMETHINGLater in the morning Trump added All of this Russia talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts & Reform Is this coincidental NOTOn Sunday talk shows Republicans rallied around Trump and questioned how CNN could have received information about secret grand jury proceedingsThere are very very strict laws on grand jury secrecy so depending on who leaked this to CNN thats a criminal violation potentially New Jersey Gov Chris Christie (R) a longtime friend of Trumps said on CNNs State of the Union on Sunday For us to have confidence in this process weve got to make sure that the grand jury process remains confidential remains secret so that the special counsel can work effectively to be able to get to the bottom of all that hes looking intoHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif) cast doubt on the objectivity of Muellers team noting that the prosecutors staff includes a lot of individuals attorneys who played in politics whove given money on the Democratic side Of the eight attorneys on the team who have been publicly identified  including President Barack Obama and Clinton This president won the election solely on the idea that he connected with the American people No other influence involved McCarthy said on Foxs Sunday Morning Futures But the idea of what Ive watched of what the Democrats have been doing it sure raises a lot of questionsRep Trey Gowdy (R-SC) chairman of the House Oversight Committee came to Muellers defense and said that he doesnt agree with Republicans who are calling for Mueller to resign or stop his investigation I would encourage my Republican friends  give the guy a chance to do his job Gowdy said on Fox News Sunday The result will be known by the facts by what he uncovers  I would say give the guy a chance to do his jobDemocratic lawmakers mostly stayed out of the Sunday fray after a week in which Clintons 2016 campaign came under fresh scrutiny The campaign funded political opposition research into Trump that helped create a highly publicized dossier on the Republican candidate and fueled some allegations now under scrutiny by MuellerThe 35-page dossier is composed of 17 memos containing raw intelligence some of it highly salacious and not independently confirmed It relies on Kremlin-linked sources and alleges that the Russian government had been trying to support Trumps candidacy while gathering compromising information that could be used as blackmail The dossier was published by BuzzFeed in January Its unclear how much the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee paid for the opposition research by Fusion GPS a Washington firm that conducts investigations for private clients The Clinton campaign paid $56million in legal fees to a law firm from June 2015 to December 2016 according to campaign finance records and the DNC paid the firm $36 million in legal and compliance consulting since November 2015 Its impossible to tell from the filings how much of that work was for other legal matters and how much of it related to Fusion GPSTrump tweeted Sunday morning that the dossier which he called Clinton made Fake Dossier could have cost as much as $12 million although he did not explain how he reached that number Trump was at it again early Monday In a tweet Trump again cited funding reports without elaborating on a source Report out that Obama Campaign paid $972000 to Fusion GPS Trump wrote The firm also got $12400000 (really) from DNC Nobody knows who OKdCompiled by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele the dossier mirrors a separate conclusion reached by US intelligence agencies that the Russian government intervened in the US election in an effort to bolster Trump and harm Clinton such as through hacking the DNC and distributing materials to WikiLeaks to publish at key momentsFusion GPS which hired Steele to gather information was first employed to investigate Trump during the Republican primaries by the  a conservative publication that receives financial support from billionaire GOP donor Paul Singer according to two people familiar with Singer The Beacon said in a statement that its research ended before Fusion GPS hired Steele and that none of the research that it commissioned is included in the dossier In April 2016 an  and the DNC hired Fusion GPS which then hired Steele Brian Fallon a former spokesman for the Clinton campaign said he learned about Steele and the dossier after the election People familiar with the matter told The Washington Post that the Clinton campaign and the DNC did not direct Steeles activitiesRep Adam B Schiff (Calif) the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence said Sunday that a lot of the information in the dossier has been corroborated I certainly would have liked to know who paid for it earlier but nonetheless thats just one factor to be considered Schiff said on ABCs This Week on Sunday It doesnt answer the ultimate question which is How much of the work is accurate How much of it is true And my colleagues dont seem particularly interested in that question but that is really the most important question for the American peopleSchiff said he has not been told anything about any impending indictments in Muellers investigation noting that such notification would not have been appropriate  Trump also tweeted Sunday about Clintons involvement in what he called the Uranium to Russia deal demanding that the matter receive greater scrutinyThe  while Clinton was secretary of state allowed a Russian nuclear energy agency to acquire a controlling stake in a Canadian-based company that had mining licenses for about 20percent of US uranium extraction capacity The company cannot export the uranium Earlier this month House and Senate Republican leaders announced they would and the House Oversight Committee launched a probe into  during the campaign In the latter investigation Republicans say they want to know why

mature reasonable kid on the blockKim kicked things off in a New Years address Sunday by saying his country was close to test-launching an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) which if successful could ultimately put a nuclear warhead within range of parts of the United StatesTrump who had once suggested inviting Kim over for a hamburger to persuade him to give up his nuclear weapons program took to his usual medium to respondNorth Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the US It wont happen Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) But how experts asked did the US president-elect aim to stop it happeningThe head of the Brookings Institution offered one interpretationHas our next commander-in-chief issued 18 days before his Inaugration a pledge that the US will wage preemptive war against the DPRK  Strobe Talbott (@strobetalbott) South Korea not wanting perhaps to contemplate that possibility of rockets raining down on the Korean Peninsula took a different view Its Foreign Ministry said Trump in his tweet had issued a clear warning to North Korea that showed his awareness of the urgency of the threat and that he will not waver from a policy of imposing sanctionsBecause of our active outreach President-elect Trump and US officials are clearly aware of the gravity and urgency of the North Korean nuclear threat ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck told a briefing They are maintaining an unwavering stance on the need for sanctions on North Korea and for close cooperation between South Korea and the USThis also raises the issue of how much interpretation should be required for the tweets of what will soon be the most powerful man in the world  Euan Graham director of the international security program atthe Lowy Institute in Sydney said the world was on the slippery slope of trying to interpret one mans not particularly coherent tweets But he added that the exchange has increased the chances that North Korea could be the first crisis out of the box in the Trump presidency at least in AsiaCertainly Trump does appear to be concerned about the issueCiting a senior US intelligence official  that Trumps first and at that time only request for a special classified intelligence briefing was for one on North Korea and its nuclear weapons program Obama also reportedly made clear his concerns over the issue at his handover conversation with TrumpBut what is Trump going to do His next tweet offered a clue Get China to do moreChina has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the US in totally one-sided trade but wont help with North Korea Nice Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Those comments did not go down particularly well in Beijing which argued it had been long pushing for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and cast itself as the voice of reason and moderationChinas efforts in this regard are perfectly obvious Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular news conference As a permanent member of the UN Security Council we have proactively participated in relevant discussions on the North Korean nuclear issue and have jointly passed several resolutions with other partiesThis shows Chinas responsible attitudeChinas nationalist Global Times newspaper took the argument a stage further saying that Trump was pandering to irresponsible attitudes and stoking the anxieties of some Americans in his accusations against ChinaChinese foreign policy experts say the United States was wrong to blame their country arguing that the fundamental motivation for North Korea formally known as the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea or DPRK to develop nuclear weapons is American hostilityThe DPRK feels unsafe because the United States wants to overthrow it said Cai Jian a professor of Korea studies at Fudan University in Shanghai Now the United States blames China and believes China is irresponsible This is very ridiculousThe United States has long insisted that North Korea must disarm before talks can be held and has responded to the countrys nuclear and missile tests by tightening sanctions The latest round was imposed by the UN Security Council in November and supported by ChinaBut despite the sanctions data shows trade between China and North Korea is still growing said GrahamKim has put North Koreas nuclear weapons policy at the center of his countrys national and security strategy China would like Pyongyang to abandon the program but is unwilling to do anything that might destabilize the regime Western experts sayFrustration with China over the issue is something Trump shares with all of his immediate predecessors Graham said but the president-elects generally hard line toward Beijing would only make it dig in its heels more firmly he saidMeanwhile Trumps brash style has been something of a propaganda gift for BeijingTheres a funny sort of inversion game going on there Graham said China is trying to posture as the global stakeholder and the reliable party for regional peace and global governance whereas the United States is in Chinas eyes reeling around like a punch-drunk heavyweightThe threat of an American missile defense system being stationed in South Korea appears to have concentrated minds in Beijing on how to punish PyongyangChina now seems ready to support limited United Nations sanctions against North Korea over a recent nuclear test and rocket launches partly in response to US pressure experts said MondayBeijing has reacted angrily to the prospect of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system being deployed in South Korea but a tougher line from Washington and Seoul seems to be having some effect on Beijings calculations experts said    on Monday China Daily argued that the missile defense system was not the answer to the North Korean crisisThere will be no ground for its introduction should the parties agree to a sanctions package that is sufficient for Pyongyang to reevaluate its nuclear program the editorial said For that to happen the new UN resolution must truly bite  The editorial echoes comments by Foreign Minister Wang Yi who  in Munich on Friday that the United Nations should adopt a resolution to ensure North Korea will pay the necessary price and to show there is a consequence for its behaviorChina of course would never admit it was reacting to American pressure It still favors much weaker sanctions than those proposed by the United States and is likely locked in negotiations to soften the blow according to Yanmei Xie a senior China analyst at the International Crisis Group in BeijingIt could even be argued that Beijing is merely hyping the likely effect of a limited sanctions package to convince Seoul that the anti-missile system deployment is unnecessary  and to cast Washington as the real troublemakerStill even nationalist tabloid  Monday that China should shift policy toward North Korea in the face of mounting pressure and growing challengesIt argued that elite and public opinion was changing with greater numbers of people now seeing North Korea as a burden and an annoying neighbor rather than an old friend This in turn led to a shift in favor of actions that make Pyongyang feel pain for its obduracyThe more Chinas policy in this regard departs from public opinion the more political cost China has to pay the Global Times wroteAfter North Korea launched a rocket this month apparently to test its ballistic missile technology Seoul agreed to begin talks with Washington on deploying a THAAD unit with the US military in South KoreaTHAAD is a land-based system designed to shoot down incoming short- medium- and intermediate-range missiles and could offer South Korea and some of the 25000 US troops deployed there greater protection against missiles launched from the NorthThe threat of deployment comes amid growing frustration in both Seoul and Washington not only with Pyongyangs actions but also with Chinas muted response  But some Chinese experts argue the THAAD system is mainly used for intercepting long-range missiles rather than short-range ones and that its real target is China They argue that the proposal has undermined Beijings friendship with Seoul and widened distrust with the United StatesForeign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Monday that the missile defense system would directly violate Chinas strategic security interests and he condemned relevant countries for using the Korea peninsula issue to undermine those interestsThere is still a huge gulf separating China and the United States in terms of their strategic goals over the North Korea issue said Shi Yinhong director of the Center for American Studies at Renmin University of China in BeijingHe said China was willing to speed up US Security Council negotiations but would not agree to any sanctions that covered its own trade with North Korea or affected its neighbors access to food or oilAny sanctions he said would be less tough than measures China itself adopted in 2013 shortly after President Xi Jinping took power and at a time when relations with Washington were on an upswingNow it is impossible for China to do the same thing given the state of Sino-US relations he said Also if China sanctions North Korea like it did in 2013 North Korea will become more of an enemyThe Crisis Groups Xie said China probably aims to do just enough in terms of sanctions to placate the South Korean government and convince Seoul to again drag its feet over the THAAD deployment as it has done for yearsChina may agree to narrow sanctions targeting certain individuals and entities but not those that could remotely threaten to destabilize the country or regime or turn North Korea into an openly hostile neighbor she saidSanctions of that nature might dial up the pressure on the North Korean regime a notch but are very unlikely to persuade it to abandon a nuclear program

House that he would have won the popular vote had it not been for millions of illegal votes according to people familiar with the meetingTrump has repeatedly claimed without evidence that widespread voter fraud caused him to lose the popular vote to Hillary Clinton even while he clinched the presidency with an electoral college victoryTwo peoplefamiliar with the meeting said Trump spent about 10 minutes at the start of the bipartisan gathering rehashing the campaign He also told them that between 3 million and 5 million illegal votes caused him to lose the popular voteThe discussion about Trumps election victory andhis claim that he would have won the popular vote was confirmed by a thirdperson familiar with the meetingThe claim is  and  found virtually no confirmed cases of voter

Trumps comments as he returned to the Capitol from the meeting Monday nightWe talked about different electoral college popular votes going through the different ones McCarthy said Well we talked about going back through past elections Everyone in there goes through elections and stuff so everybodys giving their different histories of different partsAsked by reporters after the meeting if Trump made any surprising statements at the gathering House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) replied Well I wont even go into thatJia Yongtang doesnt have much luck with the ladies He thinks its because of all the weight hes put on More likely its because his online dating picture shows him as the spitting image of Kim Jong UnThe North Korean leader might be one of the most reviled people in the world but Jia has reason to be happy about the notoriety that comes with Pyongyangs endless missile launches and occasional nuclear tests For the past four years Jia has been making a living of sorts trading on his uncanny resemblance to the young dictatorSome people are excited some people are scared said Jia  wearing sunglasses and a navy-blue Mao suit with a plastic version of the red Kim badge that all North Koreans must wear over their hearts  on the street in Taiyuan the capital of coal-producing Shanxi province I get a lot of requests for selfies Two young women stopped and gasped when they saw Kim getting into a black Mercedes-Benz SUV with a reporter They stopped and whispered to each other trying to figure out if it really was Kim But no requests for selfiesAs the worlds attention turns to Beijing to see if it will punish Kim for his  the case of Jia is something of a metaphor for the complicated relations between China and North KoreaChinas view of North Korea is very different from that of the United States Sure Beijing doesnt appreciate Kims efforts to develop deliverable nuclear weapons and there are signs of a slight chill on the border between the two countries but China is not trying to bring about regime change or much change at allFurthermore theres a kind of nostalgia here among older people in particular for the simpler communist life  the good old days before cutthroat capitalism arrived in China  Jia whos about 5 foot 3 was working as a security guard in 2012 outside the Birds Nest one of the stadiums built for the Beijing Olympics when someone commented on his resemblance to Kim who had become the third-generation leader of North Korea a few months beforeHe decided to take advantage of the likeness but becoming a more obvious Kim Jong Un took some work For starters Jia weighed only 130 pounds when he decided to morph into the North Korean leader but with some concerted fried-rice consumption hes managed to get to 190 pounds (about 10 pounds lighter than the Internet estimates the real Kim weighs)He grew out his bangs and now has a Kim coif so perfect that some people think its a wigHe appears in character at random events and even has a brief scene at the end of a new film called Drunk Youth with the Chinese Barack Obama Ending a meeting the pair waves and makes peace signs at the cameraYes Jia has seen  about the assassination of Kim that led to the entertainment company being hacked by North Korea He was not impressed with Randall Park the Korean American who played the dictatorIt would be safe to say that Jia is not on the brink of breaking into the big time His regular gigs involve appearing  often alongside his self-appointed mentor a Mao Zedong impersonator named Xiong Ding Jian  at minor events and standing around just looking like KimSometimes Jia breaks into a half-intelligible speech in Korean that hes memorized wishing people a happy new year and saying I love China  When a reporter gently pointed out that he was saying hello in the South Korean way not the version most commonly used in North Korea Jia got defensive All Koreans speak the same language he said Unspoken Dont mess with my artLike the real Kim this doppelganger is afraid the Americans are after him Im afraid the Americans will come here to kill me That theyll think Im really Kim Jong Un and will come here to kill me he said a little nervouslyBut that doesnt stop him from getting out and about in ChinaOn a recent day he appeared as a judge at a talent show in a dance school on the 19th floor of a high-rise building here in Taiyuan a second-tier city in Chinas industrial heartland As Taiyuans answer to Simon Cowell put the kids through their paces Jia sat there in his dark suit and darker glasses watching and occasionally clappingThe kids had no idea who he was supposed to be When one young girls mother said the leader of North Korea the girls face remained blankJia and Xiong came to Taiyuan at the invitation of the local cultural heritage department and appeared at events with Mao praising the citys development while Kim stood alongside himOver lunch with Jia and Xiong afterward some locals praised the two strongmenWe are very honored to have them here We have a lot of respect for North Korea and Kim Jong Un because he is the leader of a socialist country said one of the pairs lunchmates a retired military educator who uttered words that wouldnt have been out of place in his classroomA businessman chimed in Kim Jong Uns father had a really good friendship with China so we like the son We have a lot of respect for himAsked further about Chinas relationship with North Korea the men demurred saying they were just common people who didnt know much about politics and suggesting that the subject was too sensitive to be discussedAsked what Mao would have made of Kim Xiong took the diplomatic route I dont know thats for the older generation to answer he said If his father hadnt died we would be closer than we are now At that time North Korea respected China As Mao said North Korea should listen to its big brotherI care about the heart not the politics of being an actor Jia addedBut in matters of the heart hes not doing so well Xiong and the others tease Jia for being unmarried at 34 calling him an old man in an empty nestBut he rejects the suggestion that his Kim routine is damaging his chances I think it probably helps he said adding that his profile picture entices women to start conversations with him Some girls think I look like a strong leader

country is being led by someone who was put there by a foreign power Maher repliedTrump and the people whove defended him on national television have faced a barrage of criticism over what role the Russian government played in the 2016 electionAs The Washington Posts  The past few days have brought a growing list of confirmed communications between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials with each new revelation adding to a cloud of suspicion that hangs over the White House as critics demand an independent investigation  The Trump administration at first denied any contact with the RussiansRecently the Trump team has acknowledged meetings happened but described them as polite introductions Helderman reportedMichael Flynn was forced to resign as national security adviser because of his pre-inauguration contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak including a meeting alongside Trumps son-in-law and senior adviser Jared KushnerThrough it all Lord has been helping to articulate the administrations positions He re-signed with CNN in 2017 one of seven new pro-Trump commentators Lord over the past year has had several heated interactions while debating Trumps actionsHe faced off against CNNs Van Jones after Trump was unwilling to disavow the endorsement of former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David DukeThey were the military arm the terrorist arm of the Democratic Party according to historians Lord told Jones in the CNN segment from March For Gods sake read your historyThen at the Democratic National Convention Lord said the Democratic Party should take responsibility for slavery and its legacy in the United States   Ive never understood why after 176 years of writing political platforms the Democratic Party doesnt simply say We were responsible for slavery and segregation We apologize Lets name the injustice  we were responsible for creating this culture of race in this country and were sorry I mean I just dont understand whats wrong with thatBritish Prime Minister Theresa May told congressional Republicans on Thursday that the election of President Trump had ushered in the dawn of a new era of American renewal and said the United States and Britain could lead together again in a modern world fraught with uncertainty and dangerAddressing the GOP members of Congress at their annual retreat May walked a tightrope between praise for and criticism of the new administrations emerging foreign policy alternating between support for some of the positions Trump has staked out and a clear rejection of othersShe urged engagement with Russia but to beware of its president Vladimir Putin She defended the value of NATO and the United Nations while acknowledging they need changes to meet current-day needs She criticized Irans support of the government in the Syrian civil war and its malign influence in the region but defended the nuclear deal as deterring Tehran from building a bombMay said the United States and Britain were working together to defeat the ideology of Islamist extremism but in an aside suggested she does not back the idea of banning visitors and refugees from majority-Muslim countriesWe should always be careful to distinguish between this extreme and hateful ideology and the peaceful religion of Islam and the hundreds of millions of its adherents she said Nor is it enough merely to focus on violent extremism We need to address the whole spectrum of extremism starting with the bigotry and hatred that can so often turn to violence  Many of Mays remarks were met with enthusiastic applause and standing ovations  even more than when Trump spoke before the group earlier in the day On Friday May will be the first foreign leader to visit the White House since Trump was sworn in and she spoke repeatedly of the special relationship between the United States and Britain epitomized by the friendship between Republican president Ronald Reagan and the Conservative prime minister Margaret ThatcherAnother common theme was the alienation many Americans and Britons feel in an era of globalization helping sweep Trump and May before him to power Part of Mays mission is to promote trade between the two countries as Britain prepares to leave the European UnionPeople often those on modest incomes living in relatively rich countries like our own feel that the global system of free markets and free trade is simply not working for them in its current form she saidThe speech gave May the opportunity to present Republicans with a sweeping vision of what she depicted as their shared conservative worldview  one built on liberty open markets and universal rights To make her case she repeatedly invoked the three great heroes of conservative transatlantic history  Churchill Reagan and ThatcherShe also used language notably more partisan than that of her predecessors hailing the November election as an opportunity for American renewalBecause of that great victory you have won she told the Republicans to loud applause America can be stronger greater and more confident in the years aheadBut amid her lavish praise were constant reminders of just how far Trump has deviated from the conservative worldview she describedOn trade security multinational institutions and most conspicuously on Russia May laid out stances that are in keeping with a long tradition of Western consensus  but that Trump has unceremoniously discardedBy raising the differences without explicitly naming them May almost seemed to be willing Trump to return to the fold of traditional transatlantic foreign policyLess than a week after Trump proclaimed America first and suggested a shrinking global mandate for the United States May informed the crowd that Global Britain intended to take on an even more internationalist role where we meet our responsibilities to our friends and allies champion the international cooperation and partnerships that project our values around the world and continue to act as one of the strongest and most forceful advocates for business free markets and free trade anywhere around the globeAs if to underline just how far that vision is from Trumps as she spoke the White House threatened to slap a 20 percent tariff on Mexican imports amid a dispute over who will pay for the presidents planned border wallUnlike Trump a vociferous critic of alliances and multilateral institutions May defended organizations such as the United Nations NATO and even the EUIn contrast with Trumps protectionism she gave an enthusiastic endorsement of free trade  and aggressively plugged the US-British trade deal she hopes that she and Trump can ultimately reachThe most jarring difference between May and Trump however was on Russia Although Trump has appeared eager to win over Putin May urged caution She offered support for nations in the Baltics that have been menaced by Russia and cited the illegal annexation of Crimea as legitimate reasons for them to feel afraid Although Trump has questioned whether the United States should come to the defense of NATO allies in the event of an attack May was unequivocalWe should not jeopardize the freedoms that President Reagan and Mrs Thatcher brought to Eastern Europe by accepting President Putins claim that it is now in his sphere of influence she said in a line that received thundering applauseWhen it comes to Russia as so often it is wise to turn to the example of President Reagan who during negotiations with his opposite number Mikhail Gorbachev used to abide by the adage Trust but verify she said in a speech that drew repeated rounds of applause and ovationsWith President Putin my advice is to engage but bewareMay also said she thought that Britain and America should never again invade foreign countries The days of Britain and America intervening in sovereign countries in an attempt to remake the world in our own image are over she saidBritish voters have defied the will of their leaders foreign allies and much of the political establishment by opting to rupture this countrys primary connection to Europe in a stunning result that will radiate economic and political uncertainty across the globeThe voters decision to jettison Britains membership in the European Union was expected to jolt markets worldwide on Friday and unsettle Western capitals By the time the BBC had called the result at dawn in London Friday the pound had already plummeted to its lowest level against the dollar in decadesThe vote is perhaps the most dramatic to date in a wave of populist and nationalist uprisings occurring on both sides of the Atlantic that are overturning traditional notions of what is politically possibleFor months the political and economic elite had looked on with growing apprehension as Britain flirted with a choice  popularly known as Brexit  that experts had warned could lead to global recession and a rip in the Western alliance The vote could also lead to Scottish secession a broader EU unraveling and the fall of Prime Minister David Camerons governmentBut most analysts had predicted this pragmatically minded country would ultimately back away from the move and opt to keep Britain in an organization regarded as a pillar of the global economic and political order Instead a majority of British voters heeded the call of pro-Brexit campaigners to liberate the nation from what many here regard as an oppressive Brussels bureaucracy that enables mass migration into the countryLet June the 23rd go down in our history as our independence day cried a jubilant Nigel Farage a firebrand anti-EU leader in a 4 am celebration All around him leave campaigners clinked pints of beer and cheered their improbable victoryWhen polls closed six hours earlier Farage had all but conceded defeat saying he believed remain had won But as results poured in through Thursday night and into the early hours of Friday the remain camp was increasingly despairingAbout a third of results had yet to be counted as of 4 am local time But the BBC reported that leave had taken an insurmountable leadThe results came after 15 hours of voting from the remote Scottish isles to the tip of Gibraltar The outcome revealed vast divides  with massive victory margins for remain in thriving metropolitan centers such as London and equally resounding victories for leave in small towns rural areas and struggling post-industrial cities  As local authorities announced results markets swung wildly between optimism that the country would stay in the preferred choice of investors and pessimism that Britain had just voted to get outAfter initially rising to a 2016 high the pound plunged in international trading as jittery investors prepared for a scenario that had not been priced into market calculationsAs the hours ticked by there was a dawning realization that Britain could become the first country to leave the 28-member EU In television interviews remain supporters looked stricken and predicted catastropheGod help our country tweeted Paddy Ashdown the former Liberal Democrat leader and an outspoken EU advocateThe outcome will rattle officials in Washington President Obama had made a high-profile plea for Britain to stay Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump who was in Scotland on Friday to open a golf course backed Brexit  Although Britain may not actually leave the EU for years Thursdays vote fires the starting gun on what is widely expected to be a messy proceeding as Britain and EU officials begin untangling the vast web of connections between this island nation and the other 27 members of the blocThursdays outcome will be a crippling blow to Cameron who had campaigned vigorously for Britain to stay in the EU and had cast the referendum as a choice between an insular intolerant little England and an outward-looking pluralistic Great BritainHaving failed to convince a majority of voters he is expected to come under intense pressure to resignCameron initially promised the referendum in 2013 in a bid to unite the country and especially his Conservative Party behind a common stance on an issue that has divided public opinion here for decadesAt the time he may have expected a relatively easy victory But the campaign soon went off script as Justice Secretary Michael Gove and then-London Mayor Boris Johnson  friends and sparring partners of Camerons since his days at Oxford  both declared in February their intention to campaign for outThe populist-minded Johnson will now be seen as the most likely successor to Cameron if the prime minister is pushed from his perch at 10 Downing StreetI think the Boris Johnson momentum will be unstoppable said Steven Fielding a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham Cameron will try to find a dignified exit But its not clear how long the backbenchers will give him to do thatThe leave campaign found a compelling rallying cry with its call for voters to Take Back Control a slogan that resonated among an electorate ill at ease with record levels of immigration  much of it from Europe under the EUs free-movement policyPolls suggested that leave alienated some voters with its reliance on what critics saw as increasingly nativist rhetoric That was particularly true after the killing last week of pro-EU lawmaker Jo Cox a murder that appeared to awaken a passion in remain supporters that had been previously lackingA leave lead last week in the polls diminished and the race turned into a dead heat Surveys released Thursday as Britons votesdhad shown remain with a clear edge results that cheered investors and boosted markets across Europe and AsiaBut as with last years British general election the polls were badly wrong apparently unable to capture the mood of an increasingly defiant electorateThe prevailing tone of the campaign on either side was fear and loathing with neither venturing for long into hope or aspirationThat spirit mirrored the angry mood of voters across the Atlantic in the United States and surprised even close observers of a nation that sees itself as deeply pragmatic and rationalNotions of Britain as a deferential consensual society at ease with itself have been thrown out the window Fielding said This campaign has revealed a very profound mistrust among a substantial segment of society toward conventional political authority The EU became a lightning rod for mistrust of politics more broadlyThe vote split the country along essential lines Old versus young Provincial versus metropolitan Scotland versus England Native-born Britons versus immigrants  As the first votes were cast nationwide  with the often-variable British weather running the gamut from a torrential downpour in London to sunny clear skies in Scotland  anxiety was the prevailing moodHilary Clarke a 45-year-old stay-at-home mom was the first to vote at a southwest London polling station She said she would use her stubby pencil to check remain on her ballotIf I had been confident I wouldnt be standing in the rain at 7 in the morning she said as she sheltered beneath a colorful umbrella The reason Im first in the queue is Im going straight to the airport to go to Barcelona and I may not return if vote goes the wrong wayClarke said she could not understand the logic of those pushing for leaveI can see that sometimes it seems we are hemorrhaging money to the EU she said But at the same time we seem to get so much more back than we give Even if youre disagreeing with whats said at the table its better to have a place at itBut for leave voters Britains four decades of membership in the European Union and its precursors have only dragged the country downAndreas Hajialexandrou a 48-year-old businessman of Greek Cypriot heritage said the country could simply not withstand the impact of record numbers of immigrants from elsewhere in EuropeThere are pressures on local services I speak to our local [doctors] and they are just swamped he said The question is how long can you support that level of immigrationInside a dark chemistry lab in a derelict old building Pvt Shane Diaz gingerly drew 13 milliliters of an unknown brown liquid from a glass flask up into a syringeBreathing through a gas mask that made him sound like Darth Vader he was careful not to spill a drop as he put it into a sample jar Who knew what chemical weapons the North Koreans had been making hereRemove the tubing from the syringe and be mindful of the needle  it might come out Sgt Tyler Lawrence said from behind him And when you get the tubing out kill itEverything had to be done exactly by the book These samples could be used to prosecute Kim Jong Un and his cronies with war crimes before the International Criminal Court Or at least thats what the American soldiers were training forThe US and South Korean militaries are staging their  an eight-week exercise involving everything from amphibious landing exercises on southern beaches to computer-simulated decapitation strikes aimed at taking out the leaders of a certain regime just to the northAbout 17000 American troops and 300000 South Korean personnel are taking part in computer-simulated exercises which end this weekend and field drills that continue through the end of April  The allies scenario is clear to prepare to go into North Korea after the regime in Pyongyang collapses or after it orders a suicidal invasion of the SouthThe exercises come at a particularly tense time on the Korean Peninsula with   punishment for the Norths recent nuclear test and missile launch  biting at the same timePyongyang has been making its unhappiness with both developments loud and clear threatening preemptive strikes or claiming some major technological advance on a daily basisThe DPRKs army will reduce all bases and strongholds of the US and south Korean warmongers for provocation and aggression into ashes in a moment without giving them any breathing spell the state-run Korean Central News Agency said in a recent commentary about the exercises using the official abbreviation for North Korea  While North Korea has been threatening to use its nuclear weapons a key component of the drills involves dealing with chemical or biological agents About 700 soldiers 100 of them South Korean are taking part in a series of 28 drills over 18 daysIn addition to its nuclear weapons program the Kim regime is thought to possess chemical weapons including nerve agents such as sarin gas that it can make domesticallyEvidence suggests that North Korea has significant quantities and varieties of chemical weapons Joseph S Bermudez an expert on North Koreas defense  It also has to a lesser extent the ability to employ these weapons worldwide using unconventional methods of deliveryThe use of chemical weapons in Syrias civil war has shown how devastating this form of warfare can be and has refocused some attention on the Norths presumed programsAt a largely unused army base north of Seoul close to the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas soldiers were practicing what to do if they came across a clandestine chemical weapons lab in North KoreaAt a drill Monday soldiers in full combat gear from an Army unit based at Fort Hood Tex stormed the dilapidated building chosen because it was similar to what American soldiers might actually encounter in North Korea and swept through the dark rooms guns drawn  In the building they found 55-gallon drums with liquid on top empty munitions shells and a filling station a chemical lab with a sign reading quality inspection in Korean on the outside A sharp odor pervaded the space (it was Bengay that the soldiers had smeared on the walls for verisimilitude)Its more real here for sure Its a real-life scenario said 1st Lt Jonathan OConnell who had come in from Fort Hood for the exercises There are multiple known sites that are literally hours away from here by footSeeing it was clearly a chemical weapons site the soldiers called in specialists from the US Armys 2nd Infantry Division the only division with a full chemical battalion and the only chemical weapons team stationed outside the United StatesEnter Pvt Orin Johnson the team leader with his notebooks and camera Pvt Charles Kimiaga with a bucket filled with plastic sheeting and glass jars and Diaz with a scanner that started beeping immediately They were decked out in Mopp 4 gear the highest level of protective suits with gloves and boot covers taped onto their suitsUnder the close inspection of Lawrence their evaluator the three slowly moved through the rooms with their vapor detector radioing in their findings along the way It looked like a cross between CSI and Breaking BadOur guys need to be able to identify whats going on and understand whats on the site and understand whats there said Lt Col Adam Hilburgh the battalion commander We use the current intelligence picture to tailor our training to thatIf they were to actually find chemical or biological agents in North Korea the soldiers would have to take samples and keep them secure so they could be introduced at the International Criminal Court Hilburgh saidIn the chemical lab Lawrence told the men to get out their kill bucket They promptly set up a yellow bucket bag and poured in powder to kill whatever liquid was inside the flasksLawrence was not impressed with the time it was taking The [chemical] process is still ongoing he barked Youre assisting the enemyThe trio set about putting samples into glass jars  10 milliliters or about two teaspoons was all the court would need Lawrence said  and analyzing them in the scannerIt turned out it was lewisite a blister agent (Anti-lewisite pills were found in another room along with the supposed North Korean gas masks)The soldiers prepared to package it up and ship out the liquids before moving steadily up the difficulty ladderNext on their training list going underground to practice working in tunnels containing radioactive material  and very little oxygenSecretary of State John F Kerry and Chinas foreign minister agreed Wednesday to move ahead with a UN resolution condemning North Korea for its  but they appeared as far apart as ever on how far to push PyongyangThe United States says any additional UN action against the North is likely to include expanded sanctions Beijing a key ally of North Koreas  at the nuclear test this month but has not indicated whether it will endorse further pressureAs a permanent UN Security Council member China could use its veto power to block any measuresAfter a five-hour meeting between Kerry and Foreign Minister Wang Yi the two diplomats appeared before reporters with tension written across their faces Wang drummed his fingers on the side of his lectern as a grim-faced Kerry excoriated the actions of North Korea and its erratic leader Kim Jong UnKerry used unusually forceful language about the dangers posed by Pyongyang Wang repeatedly mentioned the need for stability on the Korean Peninsula While both agreed that more sanctions are warranted they said the details would have to be resolved in talks at the UN Security Council in coming days  Kim Jong Uns actions are reckless and they are dangerous Kerry said of the leader whose regime has been backed by China for six decades Whether or not he achieved the explosion of a hydrogen weapon is not what makes the difference Its that he is tryingSix-party talks also involving South Korea Russia and Japan began in 2003 but failed to make headway North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in 2006 and finally quit the talks in 2009 It has since conducted three tests the most recent on Jan6China has voted in the UN Security Council to sanction North Korea over its previous nuclear tests and it has condemned the latest one But Wang made clear that China is prepared to go only so farSanctions are not an end in themselves he said Our goal should be to bring the nuclear issue on the Korea Peninsula back to the negotiating track  Kerry declined to be specific about what sectors might be affected by sanctions But he suggested they might include trade involving the flow of goods and services between North Korea and China shipping and aviation as well as resource exchanges involving coal and other fuelThere are many different ways we think in which non-punitive to the people of North Korea but nevertheless effective steps can be taken he said Kerry came to Beijing as part of an effort by US officials to persuade the Chinese government to press Pyongyang to give up its nuclear program He said China has a special role to play because it serves as the Norths lifeline providing food fuel and a conduit for most of its trade and financial transactionsIn Beijing analysts and state media argued that pushing North Korea further could make it more aggressive or hasten the regimes collapse propelling a stream of refugees into China and potentially installing a US client state on its border Washington is exacerbating the situation they saidBut Kerry made clear that the strategy of relying on Beijing to prod Pyongyang needs to change He said North Koreas stated intention of acquiring intercontinental ballistic missiles threatens the United States which he said will never accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed stateThe United States will take all necessary steps to defend the American people and to honor our security commitments to allies in the region he said I say that making clear we do not want to raise military tensions we are not seeking additional steps other than UN Security Council resolutions but we will not walk away from any actions necessary to achieve the goalKerry also held out a carrot to North Korea saying it would get sanctions relief economic help energy and food aid plus direct humanitarian assistance if it ends its nuclear programYet even as he stood alongside Wang after their lengthy meeting which extended into lunch Kerry seemed to be pleading with China to do more to rein in its neighbor noting that China was one of five countries that negotiated an agreement to trim Irans nuclear programNuclear-related sanctions against Iran were lifted this month once Iran pared down its uranium stockpiles and disabled or mothballed parts of its nuclear facilitiesWith all due respect more significant and impactful sanctions were put in place against Iran which did not have a nuclear weapon than against North Korea which does he saidIn contrast Wangs words were laced with reluctanceOur position will not be swayed by specific events or the temporary mood of the moment he saidWang said China is committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula but he said two other principles are equally important The commitment to uphold peace and stability The commitment to resolve the issue through dialogue and consultationIn the past Washington has used less confrontational language than Kerry employed Wednesday hoping China would use its clout to pressure North Korea on its own But in recent weeks US officials have shown signs that their patience is wearing thinYanmei Xie senior China analyst with the International Crisis Group in Beijing said US officials may have recognized the limits of their softer approachNow they appear to be trying a different approach raising the stakes for China of what the US sees as inaction over North Korea she said I think the US is not pretending anymoreChinas foreign minister has a plan to ease tensions in East Asia North Korea should stop testing missiles and the United States and South Korea should stop joint military exercises he said WednesdayThe comment was delivered at a news conference in Beijing two days after North Korea test-fired four missiles and the United States and South Korea began deploying a new missile defense system raising regional tension and renewing about Asia policy under President TrumpChinas suggestion is as a first step for North Korea to suspend nuclear activity and for the US and South Korea to also suspend large-scale military drills Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said This he said could get all sides back to the negotiating tableWang warned that the United States and North Korea appear headed for a collision The two sides are like two accelerating trains coming toward each other with neither side willing to give way he saidThe question is Are the two sides really ready for a head-on collision Our priority now is to flash the red light and apply the brakes on both trains   What Wang proposed Wednesday is not new North Korea has suspension for suspension many times and the United States has balkedBut this is the first time it has been raised under Trump presenting some new possibilities said John Delury an assistant professor at Seouls Yonsei University We dont know what Trump is going to do about North Korea Delury said There is a policy review underway now and it looks like all options are on the table At the heart of all this is a question about Beijings role in relations among China North Korea South Korea Japan and the United States particularly as Washington charts a new foreign policy under TrumpIn February North Korea tested a solid-fuel rocket that it claimed was part of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the United States The country was then linked to the killing in Malaysia of ruler Kim Jong Uns half brother  who had been under Chinese protectionOn Monday as Chinas National Peoples Congress opened in Beijing and US-South Korea military exercises got underway Pyongyang launched four missiles  target practice it saidAll sides have condemned North Koreas actions What they cannot agree on is what to do nextChina says the conflict should be solved by the United States and North Korea But Washington has long argued that the conflict cannot be resolved without more help from ChinaNorth Korea and China were once as close as lips and teeth as communist revolutionary leader Mao Zedong put it Although they are still technically allies  Wang resurrected Maos lips and teeth line Wednesday  China is frustrated by North Koreas nuclear theatrics and exhausted by its economic woesAfter Februarys rocket launch Beijing closed loopholes in an existing effort to curb North Korean coal imports a sector seen as a financial lifeline for Kims regimeChinese experts insist that Beijing has few remaining options when it comes to Pyongyang mostly because North Korea sees the development of its nuclear program as the only way to protect against the United States  the North would rather have no coal or no cash than cease to exist the theory goes Even if China stops oil aid to North Korea it will still not give up developing nuclear weapons saidYang Xiyu a senior fellow at the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing  Indeed despite their many differences Beijing and Pyongyang share a belief that the presence of US troops in South Korea is the root of regional conflict  a view highlighted this week when China lashed out at the United States and South Korea over the deployment of a new antimissile systemThe United States and South Korea say theTerminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is necessary to shoot down North Korean missiles China believes it could be used to spy on Chinese airspace Although Trumps precise plans are unknown his previous comments on North Korea suggest that he thinks it is up to China to play a bigger role The THAAD deployment however could make it tougher to get Beijing on boardExperts said Trump seems unlikely for now to accept Wangs proposalThere is very little possibility that they will get back to talks said Zhang Liangui a North Korea expert at the Communist Partys Central Party SchoolThat means the next move will probably come from Washington  and depend on Trump We just hope that the US can solve this Zhang said Congcong Zhang and Jin Xin contributed to this reportTheres a chill in the air in Dandong these days and not just because winter is comingA steady stream of trucks still rumble across the single-lane bridge from China to North Korea from dawn until dusk every day and North Koreans can still be seen in the streets and in the restaurants of this grimy border city the commercial gateway to the isolated stateBut tradinghas become significantly harder in recent weeks a dozen people involved indoing businesswith North Korea said in interviews the result of a double-pronged attempt by Beijing to communicate its anger with the regime in PyongyangEverythings become tougher since September a Korean Chinese factory owner who employs North Korean workers here told The Washington Post This crackdownis because of the missile and nuclear tests and it doesnt look like its going to blow overThis news might be slightly more encouraging than official Washington has been expecting  but only slightly Although China is annoyed with North Korea its primary consideration  keeping the regime afloat  has not changedIndeed the chillhere is partly because of the tough international sanctions imposed in March after North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test They are aimed at cutting off North Koreasability to earn hard currency through coal exports and shippingBut an equal or even bigger influence is the surprise detention of a prominent Dandong business executive a member of the Communist Party no less who stands accused of helping North Korea dodge sanctions and obtain materials for its weapons programWhen business people hear this kind of story of course we feel very constrained and it makes us very cautious a South Korean businessman trading in this area said on the condition of anonymity The atmosphere is so tense that none of the business executives interviewed were willing to be publicly identified even as they insisted that everything was aboveboardBusiness is down but no one knows how long that will last Even now there are plenty of ambiguous signs The annual trade fair here was canceled  yet coal exports from North Korea are breaking records China holds the lever and its intentions can be only speculated uponFor more than a decade the international community led by the United States has tried to inflict economic pain on North Korea in an effort to convince it that the costs of pursuing a nuclear weapons program outweigh any benefitsIncreasingly tight rounds of sanctions have however clearly failed to change the regimes calculus North Koreas leader Kim Jong Un has ordered and dozens of missile launches this year apparently aiming to produce a nuclear weapon capable of reaching the US mainland   Sanctions are the only tool that the international community really has given that there is no appetite for engagement and even less for military actionIn March the UN Security Council passed a resolution that among other tough measures ordered mandatory inspections of all cargo going into North Korea and banned North Korean exports of coal iron and iron ore unless they are for livelihood purposesBut with almost all North Korean trade going through China and Dandong specifically sanctions are only as effective as Beijing wants them to be Beijing doesnt want the collapse of its impoverished nuclear-armed neighbor and it certainly doesnt want the 28000 American troops stationed in South Korea to be able to move right up to the peninsulas border with ChinaChina has a permanent interest in keeping North Korea afloat no matter what said Andrei Lankov a Korea expert who teaches at Kookmin University in Seoul You will never be able to persuade China to do something differentAs a result this frontier There were alwaysofficials willing to turn a blind eye middlemen brokering deals in the shadows entrepreneurs looking to gain a foothold in what they hoped would becomean increasingly open marketSanctions were a matter for faraway Beijing and even farther-away Washington   But theres a shift in the wind And the question now is After the nuclear tests and missile launches including three while China was hosting the Group of 20 summit meeting in September is President Xi Jinping angry enough to inflict a little more pain on KimWhat was once a black-and-white picture  China supported sanctions in principle but not in practice  has become a complicated gray oneThere is plenty of activity going on here Dozens of trucks laden with steel rebar and sacks of cement line up on the road outside the customs house every day waiting to cross into North KoreaAt the main logistics center everything from tangerines to a Mercedes-Benz SUV without tags was being prepared for export on a recent day The customs process has become a little more complicated said a North Korean driver with a truck full of tiles But if you pay its okaySolar panels and generators continue to be popular and there are still tens of thousands of North Korean laborers here And trade in coal which makes up about 40 percent of North Koreas exports hit a record in AugustThat is because China has a different interpretation of the livelihood exception said Western diplomats involved in the process While the international community has focused on the ban China is focusing on the exception   Diplomats in Beijing are highly doubtful that the Chinese government has any intention to seriously punish North Korea expressing frustration at the coal figures and skepticism about reports of tougher times on the borderIn the wake of Septembers nuclear test the United States has been pushing the United Nations to close the loophole but China has resistedChina still believes it should not hurt ordinary people in North Korea said Zhang Tuosheng director of research at the China Foundation for International and Strategic StudiesThe main problem is that the gap between the US and China on North Korea is so huge Zhang said I dont think China would agree to close the livelihood exception That would damage ordinary peopleBut one joint action even if it wasgrudging has had a tangible impactIn September the US Justice Department and its chief executive Ma Xiaohong accusing her of using the company as a front to channel American dollars to North Korea helping it to finance its nuclear weapons program It was the first time Washington had used secondary sanctions to punish a Chinese entity for helping North KoreaChinese provincial authorities while saying their actions were independent responded by detaining Ma and launching an investigation of Hongxiang alleging the company committed serious economic crimesThat someone who was such a big mover and shaker here could be stopped in her tracks has sent shivers through DandongMa was a city official and the government doesnt usually mess with people like that Its had a very serious impact here the Korean Chinese factory owner saidThe South Korean businessman echoed this sentiment I personally think that the Hongxiang case has had a bigger impact than sanctions The vibe I get is that people are being cautiousIn interviews businessmen detailed an increasingly difficult operatingenvironment  Last year I did about 10 big deals  construction equipment automobiles  but this year Ive done none said a Korean Chinese intermediary who brokers deals for investors on both sides of the borderThe actions and specifically those against Hongxiang have riled some localsDandong people are feeling insulted like the Americans are bullying us said a man who said his name was Wang and who drives business people around town This was business approved by the governments in China and North Korea You can link any material to nuclear development if you want toPeople involved in the Hongxiang case warn against seeing Chinas response as the start of a broader crackdown with one saying that getting Beijing to act was exceptionally difficultBut recent evidence shows Lankov said that Beijing has decided to enforce  and not enforce  sanctions in a new controlled wayThis is all being done at the central-government level assuming that low-level officials are difficult to control Lankov said They need it to be planned and measuredChina will always put its interests first he saidThey want to have the situation under control They will keep North Korea afloat but the central government in Beijing will decide which buttons to push and whenHow long will this chill lastBusiness executives here said they hope that it wont continue much longer Whenever there are specific events China shows that they have tightened up for a short period But after some time it goes back to business as usual said one of the South Koreans who spoke to The PostBut the ball is in North Koreas courtIt depends on whether there is a sixth nuclear test or not the Korean Chinese middleman said If that happens things are going to get even harder Yoonjung Seo and Congcong Zhang contributed to this reportRead moreChina will suspend all imports of coal from North Korea until the end of the year the Commerce Ministry announced Saturday in a surprise move that would cut off a major financial lifeline for Pyongyang and significantly enhancethe effectiveness of UN sanctionsCoal is North Koreas largest export item and also Chinas greatest point of leverage over the regimeThe ministrysaid the ban would come into force Sunday and be effective until Dec 31China said the move was designed to implement Novembers United Nations Security Council

of Kim Jong Uns half brother in MalaysiaKim Jong Nam had been hosted and protected by China for many years and his murder if proved to be conducted on Pyongyangs orders would be seen as a direct affront to Beijing experts said  China has also come under significant international pressure to do more to rein in North Koreas nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs whileChinese President Xi Jinping is believed to have become increasingly irritated by Kim Jong Uns behaviorNorth Korea is Chinas fourth-biggest supplier of coal Although China announced in April that it would ban North

cover for coal to continue to flow across the border in huge quantities with imports of non-lignite coal up 145percent last year to 225 million metric tons (248 million US tons)But in a sign that Beijings patience was running out it rejected a coal shipment from North Korea worth about $1million Monday the day after the test of an intermediate-range ballistic missile South Koreas Yonhap News Agency reportedChina has long been reluctant to do anything that might threaten the stability of the North Korean regime  mainly because it fears that the reunification of the Korean Peninsula could bring South Korea an American ally that hosts US troops right up to its borderGiven that a total ban on coal imports could be destabilizing it remains to be seen how firmly the pledge will be carried out But Pyongyangs unwillingness to consider Chinas interests has badly damaged  or even destroyed  trust between the long-standing alliesChina still places a premium on stability but Xi Jinping is growing more and more frustrated with Kim Jong Un saidPaul Haenle director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing adding that the missile test and the assassination were seen as serious offensesBeijing took the assassination as a direct affront to China Xi is less willing to tolerate these provocations he said China is putting a squeeze on its economic lifeline to send a message to PyongyangWang Weimin a professor at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs at Fudan University in Shanghai said sympathy for North Koreas national security concerns had disappeared in Beijing and blood ties between the countries had been broken as it became clear that the regime could not be tamedIf we choose an ally that cant be tamed we might become the biggest loser he said Thats why we are more and more strict with North Korea Now self-interest is central We wont pay attention to North Koreas interests anymorePresident Trump hasalso called on China to put more pressure on North Korea to stop its nuclear weapons program and the subject may have come up during a telephone conversation he had with Xi earlier this monthChina hastotal control over North Korea Trump said in an interview on Fox & Friends in early January And China should solve that problem And if they dont solve the problem we should make trade very difficult for China  The UN Security Council condemned North Koreas latest missile test Monday and urged members to redouble efforts to enforce sanctions That appeal came after an emergency meeting in New York called by the United States Japan and South Korea Jin Xin contributed to this reportThe United States rebuffed a proposal from China to apply the brakes to an escalating standoff with North Korea saying positive action was required before it would engage with the irresponsible Kim Jong UnChina was trying to mediate the rising tensions in East Asia which pit its once-close ally North Korea against the United States and its evolving foreign policy under President TrumpThe North Koreans have given us enough reason to think how irresponsible they are with little cause to believe that were dealing with a rational person on this said Nikki Haley the US ambassador to the United Nations Speaking to reporters Wednesday after an emergency UN Security Council meeting on North Korea she added We have to see some sort of positive action by North Korea before we can take them seriouslyThere has been no official Chinese reaction to the snubChinas foreign minister Wang Yi  Wednesday to suspend missile tests in return for a suspension of US-South Korea military exercisesWang compared the United States and North Korea to two accelerating trains coming toward each other with neither side willing to give wayHe cast China as a railway worker or signalman trying to keep things on track though US critics argue that China is not a neutralsignalman but Pyongyangs patronA suspension for suspension deal Wang argued was key to preserving peace and getting back to the negotiating tableWhat he proposed has been pitched before by North Korea and rejected by the United States But with the Trump administration still fleshing out its foreign policy some experts wondered whether the proposal had a shotIt did not Haley said the administration is still deciding how to proceed I can tell you were not ruling anything out and were considering every option thats on the table she saidThey may need to move quickly The early months of the Trump presidency have coincided with a surge of tension in AsiaIn February North Korea  a

brother Kim Jong Nam who had been under Chinese protectionThen on Monday as US-South Korean military exercises got underway Pyongyang  launching four missiles that landed in waters off the Japanese coastThe same night the United States and South Korea pushed ahead with the long-planned deployment of an antimissile system that China strongly opposesAt the center of this complex and evolving conflict are questions about Chinas ties to North Korea and the US role in East Asian affairs particularly under TrumpChina and North Korea see the presence of US troops in South Korea as the root of regional conflict and they wantthe United States to acknowledge or address thisThe United States and South Korea are focused on the North Korean threatThey say THAAD is a defensive system designed to shoot down North Korean missilesBut China believes that THAAD could be used to spy on Chinese airspace and sees the system as evidence of US military meddling in Asian affairs After the deployment on Monday Chinas Foreign Ministry warned of unspecified consequences for the United States and South Korea and has continued to target South Korean business interestsThe United States meanwhile has pushed for China to play a more assertive role in reining in North KoreaWith Chinese leaders outraged over THAAD the  for the Trump administration will be getting them to abandon their patronage of North Korea Jin Xin contributed to this reportIn a US election cycle where it often seems that nobody agrees on anything the presidential front-runners appear to share one article of faith China is the key to fixing North KoreaAsked how they would handle Pyongyang   and  have all mentioned the need to push or pressure China to do moreNow come reports that China and the United States are making  on a UN resolution to tighten sanctions on North Korea On Wednesday diplomats at the UN Security Council said the two permanent members of the body have reached an agreement on the draft resolution

for the Obama administration a diplomatic ray of light amid the gloom in the region over disputes in  It could also hurt North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his cronies experts sayBut another tougher round of sanctions is far from the cure-all that some politicians imagine China and the United States remain at odds over what the new rules are supposed to achieve  Everyone is talking about sanctions said Stephan Haggard a North Korea expert at the University of California at San Diego But we have to ask Sanctions to what endAsking China to act on North Korea makes sense Beijing and Pyongyang are   frenemies really  and it is no secret that North Koreas economy is sustained in large part by trade across the Chinese borderThe latest US proposal calls for a more aggressive targeting of the firms that keep Kim in business including secondary sanctions against companies that do business with those firmsThe strategy is designed to hit Kim where it hurts said Sung-Yoon Lee a Korea specialist at Tufts Universitys Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy The North Korean people are uniquely isolated and cut off but the regime is not It depends on cash flow depends on international financial transactions and depends on the dollar system to feed the eliteThis approach has worked before Nearly a decade ago by  a Macau-based institution that handled North Korean money the United States cut off Pyongyangs cash supply  and brought North Korea back to nuclear negotiations (Those talks later fell apart)Tong Zhao an expert on nuclear disarmament at Beijings Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy said the measures being formulated are not just about finance but also are an effort by the United States to put more pressure on ChinaBeijing has long opposed unilateral sanctions and is wary of any move that might hurt its economy or cause instability across the border At the same time it is increasingly frustrated by North Korea and worried about a  That makes Beijing more receptive to sanctions that   or so Washington hopesAfter Obama signed the new sanctions legislation last week a South Korean newspaper  that ICBC a major Chinese bank was curbing its business in North Korea according to a branch near the border The report was  of a potential shift in Chinas strategyBut calls to several banks in Dandong a key hub at the China-North Korea border suggest that the policy direction is far from clear Reached by phone workers at Bank of China China Merchants Bank and Bank of Dandong branches said they no longer did business with North Korea An employee at China Construction Bank said it was doing business with North Korea but would not go into detailsNorth Korea watchers warned against seeing the ICBC anecdote or any branchs statement as proof of a real push to stop cross-border transactions Weve seen this movie before China starts to enforce some sanctions and then a month later they loosen up again said Bonnie Glaser a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in WashingtonThe Chinese might be looking for some things to do to ease the pressure that the US is putting on them she saidAlthough China says it supports UN Security Council resolutions on North Korea it has a bad enforcement record according to UN and  reportingThe North Korean regime has deep connections to various sectors of Chinas economy A real or rumored crackdown at the big banks is unlikely to prevent smaller banks from moving money across the border let alone curb the trade in resources experts saidIts inconvenient as hell for North Koreans to move cash across borders but this relationship is way bigger than banking said Adam Cathcart who studies China and North Korea at the University of Leeds in BritainReached by telephone a man who gave his name as Mr Han who works at a Chinese company that imports minerals from North Korea dismissed the idea of tighter sanctions with a profanity He said he moves his money through local banks or in cash without any problem I can basically do anything he saidAnother mineral trader who identified himself only as Mr Cai said that US sanctions would not hurt him but that UN measures could make a dent if China chose to enforce themBoth said business is down because of a slump in commodity prices not as a result of politicsHaggard the North Korea expert at the University of California at San Diego said the economic slump plus sanctions could increase pressure on Pyongyang But that does not mean a lasting solution is in sight he saidEven with China on board there is no quick fix Liu Liu Gu Jinglu and Xu Jing contributed to this reportChina warned Tuesday of consequences for South Korea and the United States over the deployment of a US antimissile system further raising regional tension and posing a challenge to the Trump administrationThe stern words came a day after North Korea launched four missiles that landed off the Japanese coast  an exercise the North Korean government said designed to practice for in JapanAmerican and South Korean officials say the continuing missile launches by the North Koreans demonstrate why the new antimissile system is necessary as a defense against Kim Jong Uns regime The US military began  the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system to South Korea on MondayBut Beijing as a threat to the Chinese military and evidence of US meddling in East Asian affairs I want to emphasize that we firmly oppose the deployment of THAAD Geng Shuang a spokesman for Chinas Foreign Ministry said Tuesday at a daily news briefing in Beijing We will resolutely take necessary measures to defend our security interestsAll consequences entailed from this will be borne by the US and the Republic of KoreaGeng did not provide details on what consequences are in store for either country although South Korean officials said they expected retaliatory moves against companies doing business in ChinaThe stepped-up tensions in East Asia create a potentially difficult and multipronged problem for the United States involving South Korea in the midst of internal political turmoil North Korea often

from leaving its territory prompting the Malaysian government to accuse it of hostage takingMalaysia retaliated by banning all North Koreans from exiting its borders and warning the Kim regime that it was inviting further international opprobrium China was angered by the Feb13 murder which the Malaysians say employed VX nerve agent and some analysts suggest the North Korean missile launch was secondarily designed to provoke BeijingIn Washington State Department spokesman Mark Toner reiterated US criticism of North Korea and the missile launches Theyre increasingly becoming a pariah through this kind of behavior he said Were pursuing tougher and tougher sanctions but were also looking at other means to make that message clear to themChinas Foreign Ministry did not specify any actions against the United States on Tuesday but Beijings displeasure over the antimissile system marked an abrupt change in tone after a generally cautious approach until now toward the new American presidentAlthough some Chinese initially welcomed the idea of Donald Trumps presidency convinced a seasoned businessman would take a practical approach to politics Trumps early moves on Taiwan Since the inauguration Chinese officials have taken a careful approach playing up the positive and playing down areas of disagreement including Trump administration comments on the South China Sea That is until Gengs statement on Tuesday Plans to deploy the THAAD system which predates the Trump presidency have long been a source of tension between Seoul and BeijingIn the run-up to the deployment China has taken aim atSouth Korean businesses in China Beginning on Friday it has been warning would-be Chinese tourists against booking trips to South Korea  Although some travel agencies have already stopped selling tickets and tours to South Korea Chinas National Tourism Administration has officially ordered travel agencies to stop all tour groups and cruise ships by March15 the South Korean official saidThe new measures would also shut down duty-free shops run by Lotte the South Korean conglomerate that helped Seoul secure land for THAAD according to the South Korean officialA representative of Chinas Tourism Administration said by phone that the agency has indeed advised travel agencies not to sell South Korea tours or ticketsThe South Korean official and the Chinese tourism representative spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to give information to the news mediaThree large Chinese travel agencies confirmed the order from the Tourism Administration Two said they have already stopped selling packages the other said it would stop selling by March 15After Lotte helped the South Korean government secure land for THAAD it was denounced and threatened in Chinas Communist Party-controlled press Nearly two dozen of the companys retail outlets were subsequently shut down by Chinese authorities for alleged safety violations  China recently rejected applications by Korean airlines to add charter flights on popular tourists routes a move interpreted in South Korea as a  on the missile systemThere have also been scattered efforts to implement a pop-culture blockade with South Korean television programs pulled from Chinese websites calls for boycotts of South Korean cosmetics and canceled K-Pop (Korean pop) showsPolitically motivated attacks on foreign business are strikingly at odds with Chinas recent calls to protect globalization and free trade most notably President Xi Jinpings  at the World Economic

would seek international action against possible violations of the World Trade Organization and the Seoul-Beijing free trade agreementHe also pledged to help South Korean companies deal with any discrimination they faceThe South Korean official called Chinas moves regrettable noting that curbing business will hurt Chinese vendors tooNorth Koreas missile launch on Monday further complicates the tensions The state-run Korean Central News Agency said the four missiles were intended as practice for an attack on the bases of the US imperialist aggressor forces in Japan After a flight of

Congcong Zhang and Jin Xin in Beijing contributed to this reportThe Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee helped fund research that resulted in a now-famous dossier containing allegations about President Trumps connections to Russia and possible coordination between his campaign and the Kremlin people familiar with the matter saidMarc E Elias a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC retained Fusion GPS a Washington firm to conduct the researchAfter that Fusion GPS hired dossier author Christopher Steele a former British intelligence officer with ties to the FBI and the US intelligence community according to those people who spoke on the condition of anonymityElias and his law firm Perkins Coie retained the company in April 2016 on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the DNC Before that agreement Fusion GPSs research into Trump was funded by an unknown Republican client during the GOP primaryThe Clinton campaign and the DNC through the law firm continued to fund Fusion GPSs research through the end of October 2016 days before Election DayFusion GPS gave Steeles reports and other research documents to Elias the people familiar with the matter said It is unclear how or how much of that information was shared with the campaign and the DNC and who in those organizations was aware of the roles of Fusion GPS and Steele One person close to the matter said the campaign and the DNC were not informed by the law firm of Fusion GPSs roleThe dossier has become a lightning rod amid the intensifying investigations into the Trump campaigns possible connections to Russia Some congressional Republican leaders have spent months trying to discredit Fusion GPS and Steele and tried to determine the identity of the Democrat or organization that paid for the dossier  that the Justice Department and FBI should immediately release who paid for itElias and Fusion GPS declined to comment on the arrangement A DNC spokeswoman said [Chairman] Tom Perez and the new leadership of the DNC were not involved in any decision-making regarding Fusion GPS nor were they aware that Perkins Coie was working with the organization But lets be clear there is a serious federal investigation into the Trump campaigns ties to Russia and the American public deserves to know what happenedBrian Fallon a former spokesman for the Clinton campaign said he wasnt aware of the hiring during the campaignThe first I learned of Christopher Steele or saw any dossier was after the election Fallon said But if I had gotten handed it last fall I would have had no problem passing it along and urging reporters to look into itSome of the details are included in a Tuesday letter sent by Perkins Coie to a lawyer representing Fusion GPS telling the research firm that it was released from a client-confidentiality obligation The letter was prompted by a legal fight over a subpoena for Fusion GPSs bank recordsPeople involved in the matter said that they would not disclose the dollar amounts paid to Fusion GPS but that the campaign and the DNC shared the costSteele previously worked in Russia for British intelligence The dossier is a compilation of reports he prepared for Fusion GPS The dossier alleged that the Russian government collected compromising information about Trump and that the Kremlin was engaged in an effort to assist his campaign for presidentUS intelligence agencies later released a public assessment asserting that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to aid Trump The FBI has been investigating whether Trump associates helped the Russians in that effort  Trump has adamantly denied the allegations in the dossier and has dismissed the FBI probe as a witch huntOfficials have said that the FBI has confirmed some of the information in the dossier Other details including the most sensational accusations have not been verified and may never beFusion GPSs work researching Trump began during the Republican presidential primaries when the GOP donor paid for the firm to investigate the real estate magnates backgroundFusion GPS did not start off looking at Trumps Russia ties but quickly realized that those relationships were extensive according to the people familiar with the matter   Those people said that it is standard practice for political campaigns to use law firms to hire outside researchers to ensure their work is protected by attorney-client and work-product privilegesThe Clinton campaign paid Perkins Coie $56 million in legal fees from June 2015 to December 2016 according to campaign finance records and the DNC paid the firm $36 million in legal and compliance consulting since November 2015  though its impossible to tell from the filings how much of that work was for other legal matters and how much of it related to Fusion GPSAt no point the people said did the Clinton campaign or the DNC direct Steeles activities They described him as a Fusion GPS subcontractorSome of Steeles allegations began circulating in Washington in the summer of 2016 as the FBI launched its counterintelligence investigation into possible connections between Trump associates and the Kremlin Around that time Steele shared some of his findings with the FBIAfter the election the FBI agreed to pay Steele to continue gathering intelligence about Trump and Russia but the bureau pulled out of the arrangement after Steele was publicly identified in news reportsThe dossier was published by BuzzFeed News in January Fusion GPS has said in court filings that it did not give BuzzFeed the documentsCurrent and former US intelligence officials said that Steele was respected by the FBI and the State Department for earlier work he performed on a global corruption probeIn early January then-FBI Director James B Comey presented a two-page summary of Steeles dossier to President Barack Obama and President-elect Trump In May Trump fired Comey which led to the appointment of Robert S Mueller III as special counsel investigating the Trump-Russia matterCongressional Republicans have tried to force Fusion GPS to identify the Democrat or group behind Steeles work but the firm has said that it will not do so citing confidentiality agreements with its clientsLast week Fusion GPS executives invoked their constitutional right not to answer questions from the House Intelligence Committee The firms founder Glenn Simpson had previously given a 10-hour interview to the Senate Judiciary CommitteeOver objections from Democrats the Republican leader of the House Intelligence

American people are more treacherous than Richard Nixons attacks on the press former Post reporter  Trumps comments are reminiscent of dictators and authoritarians including Stalin including HitlerIn an editorial  the language that Mr Trump deployed on Friday is more typically used by leaders to refer to hostile foreign governments or subversive organizations It also echoed the language of

the failing New York Times Colbert said mocking McMasters introductory remarks Wow things have really changed since I was in the Army five minutes agoSpecial counsel Robert S Mueller III fired his opening salvo this week unsealing charges against three former Trump campaign aides thought to have engaged in a medley of wrongdoingThe cases he revealed legal analysts said indicate he is pursuing an extensive probe that will explore both personal wrongdoing of those connected with President Trump and possible efforts campaign officials took to work with Russia to influence the 2016 electionCollusion  the word Trump often uses to describe Muellers case even as he asserts such a thing never happened  is not itself a crime and Muellers team will probably have to sort through unseemly political dealings to determine whether a law was broken legal analysts said In his first public charges though Mueller offered a hint of the direction he might take  Former campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos for example pleaded guilty to making a false statement to FBI investigators who asked about his contacts with foreigners claiming to have high-level Russian connectionsOf particular note he falsely described his interactions with a London-based professor claiming to have connections to high-level Russian officials who purportedly had dirt on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emailsPapadopoulos said his interactions with the professor  thought to be   occurred before he joined the campaign and did not amount to much In fact the professor told him about the emails in April 2016  after his role on the campaign was made public  and the two were involved in extensive discussions about a possible meeting between the Trump campaign and Russian officials according to Papadopouloss plea agreement  The conversation about emails is possibly a critical piece of evidence legal analysts said That is because one charge that investigators might try to substantiate against those higher in the Trump campaign is a conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse ActIf Mueller can find evidence that members of Trumps team conspired in Russias hacking effort  by directing it or aiding in another way  they might face criminal charges legal analysts said Papadopouloss plea says that he discussed some of his efforts to broker a meeting with the Russians with other more senior Trump campaign officials  although some seemed to treat him warily  Theres a significant difference between the Russians having dirt and offering that dirt and someone asking the Russians to commit an illegal act to obtain that dirt said Jacob Frenkel a white-collar lawyer at Dickinson Wright who previously worked in the now-defunct Office of the Independent Counsel The latter likely would be prosecutable and probably as a conspiracy to commit a computer crime or as a computer crimePapadopouloss conversation about emails of Clinton took place a month after  and well before  Also it was not until June 2016 that  that the Democratic National Committees computer network had been breachedBut at that time it was well known that Clinton had deleted tens of thousands of emails she deemed personal from her private server Those messages were of great interest to Republicans who believed they might show something nefariousIt was unclear to what emails the professor was referring or if he truly had access to any messages damaging to Clinton Jonathan Biran a former federal prosecutor now in private practice at Biran Kelly said Muellers team is probably asking What did people within the campaign know about how those emails had been obtained and whether they had reason to believe they were illegally obtainedAaron Zelinsky a lawyer in the special counsels office said at Papadopouloss plea hearing which was held in secret earlier this month that the foreign policy advisers case was a small part of a large-scale ongoing investigation Though Papadopoulos was first arrested in July the court kept his case sealed for months after prosecutors asserted that making it public would significantly undermine his ability to serve as a proactive cooperatorFormer Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Rick Gates his longtime business partner were charged in a separate 12-count indictment in connection with their work advising a Russia-friendly political party in Ukraine While their charges do not directly relate to their roles on the Trump campaign legal analysts said the case could offer a preview of how Mueller plans to proceedAmong many other counts including conspiracy to launder money and failing to file reports of foreign bank accounts Manafort and Gates were charged with carrying out a conspiracy against the United States Specifically the special counsel alleged that they worked to defraud the Justice and Treasury departments as they tried to hide their incomes and lobbying work for Ukrainian interestsMueller could be working to convince Manafort and Gates to cooperate and he could also be trying to send a message to others in Trumps orbit that he will leave no stone unturned and that those who deceive investigators will be charged legal analysts saidBut Mueller also could be signaling a charge he could pursue in connection with the coordination case  a conspiracy to defraud the United States by coordinating with RussiaCollusion is not a crime but basically the criminal equivalent is conspiracy said former federal prosecutor Randall Eliason You could have a conspiracy to defraud the US by interfering with our electionMueller must also separate efforts that might seem seedy from those that are illegalAn opposition research firm funded by Clintons campaign and the DNC tapped a former British spy to dig into Trumps personal and business dealings and the former spy purportedly solicited information from Russian government officials That work might similarly be viewed as an unsavory effort to engage with foreign interests to win an election but it would not necessarily be illegal if there was no conspiracy to defraud anyone legal analysts saidThere could be something out there that stinks to high heaven Frenkel said but it doesnt make it a violation of law Devlin Barrett contributed to this reportA conservative publication said Friday it paid a Washington research firm to start probing Donald Trumps background  a move that set in motion a chain of events leading to the explosive dossier alleging ties between Trump associates and RussiaIn a statement the Washington Free Beacon said it retained Fusion GPS to provide research on multiple Republican candidates in the 2016 presidential election Two people familiar with billionaire GOP donor Paul Singer said he provides financial support to the publication A spokesman for Singers firm Elliott Management did not respond to requests seeking comment The Free Beacon said its research ended before Fusion GPS hired a former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to produce a series of reports alleging links between Russia and those close to Trump That occurred after the firm was

statement from Free Beacon editor in chief Matthew Continetti and chairman Michael Goldfarb We stand by our reporting and we do not apologize for our methods  The Free Beacons lawyers notified the House Intelligence Committee of its role in the matter FridayThe website published a statement on Friday that said it paid Fusion GPS to research multiple candidates in the Republican presidential primary just as we retained other firms to assist in our research into Hillary Clinton Since its inception in 2012 the website has retained third-party firms to conduct research on many individuals and institutions of interest to us and our readers Opposition research is nothing new in political races or the corporate world but it is not a common practice for a news website to hire out such work which is often expensive Firms like Fusion GPS can charge tens of thousands of dollars for research on a single subject After the Free Beacon stopped paying Fusion GPS the research firm offered in April 2016 to continue researching Trump for the Clinton campaign and the DNC The Free Beacon said it did not know at the time that the Clinton campaign and the DNC hired Fusion GPS later to continue the work  The dossier  a collection of reports compiled by Steele that began in mid-2016 and continued after the election  cited sources familiar with the inner workings of the Kremlin who said Russia

his submarineMadsen was taken into custody on Aug 12and his trial is expected to begin in MarchSince August Madsens retelling of what led to Walls death has changed repeatedly He is being held in Vestre Prison in Copenhagen and has been charged with manslaughter Madsen told a Danish court that he was showing Wall around his boat when he lost his grip on a 150-pound hatch which then collided with Walls skull He said he panicked and gave Wall what prosecutors called a burial at seaIn the shock I was in it was the right thing to do Madsen  according to Agence France-PresseReuters  that Madsen said there was a pool of blood where she had landed before he panicked and tossed her lifeless body overboardYet when divers discovered Walls  in early October the gruesome details of that burial began to cast doubt on Madsens testimony The Associated Press reported that Walls severed legs were found in plastic bags weighted with metal while her recovered head showed no signs of fracture like it would have if struck by a hatchAnother bag contained a knife along with Walls clothing A naked torso had been found in the same waters weeks earlier and had been stabbed 15 times according to the APBut even Madsens claim that he gave Wall at burial at sea contradicted what he told police immediately after her disappearance Madsen initially claimed he dropped Wall off on shore in Copenhagen before his submarine  a 60-foot UC3 Nautilus  sankBut once police pulled the boat up from the sea floor they discovered blood inside Madsen was arrested on a manslaughter charge and accused of scuttling his own ship Authorities matched blood found inside the submarine with DNA from the torso and from Walls toothbrush and hairbrush police said in a news conferenceWhen the torso washed up on shore several days after the submarine was recovered Madsen conceded that Wall had died on board But he claimed it was an accident caused by the falling hatch The charges against Madsen were then upgraded to murderTwo people are on a boat Her legs and head and arms were cut off and we can prove that Jakob Buch-Jepsen special prosecutor with the Copenhagen police told The Washington Post Madsen has told prosecutors that he was interested in sadomasochism and had had sex onboard the Nautilus beforeIn September aSwedish newspaper quoted Madsens defense lawyer as saying Madsen was not quite like other people in his sexual preferences despite his being harmless Madsen still denies having sex with Wall according to Mondays news releaseYet  prosecutors said they had discovered videos on Madsens computer of women being tortured and decapitated Buch-Jepsen said he and his colleagues presumed the images to be realMadsen said duringthe pretrial session that the computer hard drive  which was found in a laboratory run by Madsen  didnt belong to him but instead were part of tools used by everyone in the laboratoryMondays news release said that over the past two weeks several dives had been carried out to find Walls arms and cellphone The dives have so far been unsuccessfulUnlike garden variety yeast infections this one causes serious bloodstream infections spreads easily from person to person in health-care settings and survives for months on skin and for weeks on bed rails chairs and other hospital equipmentSome strains are resistant to all three major classes of antifungal drugs Based on information from a limited number of patients up to 60 percent of people with these infection have died Many of them also had other serious underlying illnessesThose at greatest risk are individuals who have been in intensive care for a long time or who are onventilators or have central line catheters inserted into a large veinIn the United States the largest number of infections has been reported in New York with at least 28 cases according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Infections have also been reported in Illinois Maryland Massachusetts and New Jersey Last June the CDC sent an urgent alert to clinicians to start looking for the infections which are difficult to identify with standard laboratory methodsAs soon as we put out that alert we started to get information about cases and now we know more about how it spreads and how its acting Tom Chiller the CDCs top fungal expert said in an interview Thursday The CDC now tracks the updating the case count every few weeksIn addition to the 35 infected patients an additional 18 were carrying the organism but werent sickened by itThe microbe is among a group of newly emerging drug-resistant threats health officials saidThese pathogens are increasing theyre new theyre scary and theyre very difficult to combat said Anne Schuchat CDCs acting director during a briefing in Washington this week about the growing danger fromOf the first seven cases that were last fall four patients had bloodstream infections and died during the weeks to months after the pathogen was identified Officials said they couldnt be sure whether the deaths were caused by the infection because all the individuals had other serious medical conditions Five patients had the fungus initially isolated from blood one from urine and one from the earThe infection is still relatively rare Its really hitting the sickest of the sick Chiller saidSo far the fungus doesnt seem to be evolving into new strains within the United States Because the country doesnt yet have any homegrown strains of the deadly fungus it gives us a better opportunity to contain it and stop it from spreading Chiller saidIn other countries infections have been resistant to all three major types of antifungal drugs but so far the US cases have been treatable with existing drugsBecause invasive bloodstream infections with  are common in hospitalized patients in the United States health officials are concerned that this deadly strain could get into that mix Chiller saidUnlike  infections in the mouth throat or vagina (which are typically called yeast infections) invasive yeast infections can affect the blood heart brain eyes bones and other parts of the body and are more dangerousAmong infectious disease clinicians and laboratory personnel infections involving fungi dont typically ring the same kind of alarm bells as   until nowThis is a paradigm shift because is not generally thought of as highly resistant or passed person to person Chiller saidSince the CDC issued its alert in June the agency has provided funds and additional expertise to help regional laboratories and hospitals identify the organismKim Jong Un stood on the stage in front of stylized portraits of his father and grandfather men he wasnt supposed to be strong enough or cunning enoughto succeed lauding the thrilling explosion of the most recent nuclear test and the leap forward in all sectors of the national economyHis Western-style suit his haircut his glasses even his gravelly voice were all reminiscent of his grandfather Kim Il Sung the founder and eternal president of North Korea who to this day is associated with strength and prosperityIn front of him in the huge hall were 3467 delegates called in May to the before Kim Jong Un was even born Among them were hard-nosed party stalwarts the sort who had been expected by some analysts to turn against the inexperienced upstart when he first rose to the top But there they were men in military uniforms covered to the waist in medals cheering party officials scientists the editor of the party newspaper anti-Japanese revolutionary war veterans field laborersIt was Kims moment It was his way of saying Im in charge here And these were the people who were keeping him in power the North Korean loyalists who like Kim have a vested interest in keeping the worlds most repressive regime intactTheir supportenabled Kim to celebrate his fifth anniversary as the leader of North Korea on Saturday propelling the communist monarchy into its 71st yearThe Kim family has ruled the country through fear and favors since the end of World War II when Kim Il Sung was chosen by Joseph Stalin to run it as a Soviet client state His son Kim Jong Il continued the family rule for 17 years until his five years ago Saturdayat age 69The founders grandson Kim Jong Un was then anointed as the Great Successor in a country where the Kim family is deified and its supporters live large while the remaining 20-odd million North Koreans struggle to feed their families and heat their shabby homesDuring the transition plenty of people who make a living studying North Korea from abroad predicted the systems demise doubtful that a Swiss-educated Chicago Bulls fan with no military background and none of the revolutionary myth of his forebears could retain control of a country run by hard-line octogenariansBut he hasFive years on the Kim regime has not just held together it is relatively strong  The economy has been growing if not booming The country has functioning nuclear weapons and is toward being able to deliver them to the continental United StatesKim has given his closest ally Chinese President Xi Jinping the cold shoulder and suffered little for it He has threatened to attack the United States and has actually attacked South Korea but the sanctions imposed as punishment have fallen well short of fatalHe has been a good dictator in the sense that he has behaved in accordance with the rules said Bruce Bueno de Mesquita a political scientist at New York University who describes how authoritarian leaders around the world retain power in his book  Why Bad Behavior Is Almost Always Good PoliticsHe has governed through corruption and rent-seeking and keeping the population miserableAnd theres no reason to expect Kim to be going anywhere soon Bueno de Mesquita said If they survive the first two years most dictators die in their sleepKen Gause a North Korea leadership expert at CNA a research company in Arlington Va agreed that Kim seems firmly in control  at least for nowYou have a leader who is becoming more comfortable in his own skin and is able to delegate and manipulate the levers of power in a much more sophisticated way Gause said I would say he is still working on building and solidifying his power But for all intents and purposes he is the leader in every sense of the wordFor kleptocratic dictators the world over the key to staying in power is keeping the elite happy and rivals scaredNowhere is this the case more than in North KoreaKim has retained power by relying on a relatively small group  perhaps a couple of hundred military officials Politburo members and money-makers who also have an interest in keeping him at the helm When he convened the congress in May he put more of his core supporters into positions of power Regimes like this stay intact by spending money on the military and the apparatchiks instead of on the massesHes paying the people who keep him in office enough so they wont defect to anyone else Bueno de Mesquita said He needs to keep the loyalists loyalAnd for the loyalists of Pyongyang life is the best it has been in decadesThere are new high-rise apartment buildings popping up everywhere although the lower floors are most desired since there isnt enough electricity to power the elevators Theres a pizza restaurant in the city and a German beer hall amusement parks and swimming pools Supermarkets stock Japanese mayonnaise and French wine Taxis are everywhere With money anything is possibleAnd increasingly people have money  Once reliant entirely on the state North Koreans have been increasingly allowed to Factory managers and co-operative farmers have more freedom to innovate as long as they meet their state quotas and private trade in products from television sets to chewing gum is now tolerated A recent study from Seouls Korea Institute for National Unification that the North Korean government collects between $13million and $17million each day in fees from market tradersA new class of donju or masters of money has emerged in this space between state and private activity using their positions in the regime  many travel to the outside world where they can trade  to enrich their leader and themselvesBut while tinkering at the margins Kim has operated very much according to the playbook written by his grandfather He has elevated the standing of the Workers Party and emphasized economic development both of which under his father were subordinated to the military and nuclear weaponsThere is no doubt that the economy is a shadow of what it could be State factories remain stuck in the Soviet era if they are operating at all Tough multilateral and direct sanctions imposed after nuclear and missile tests are bitingThose sanctions threaten the foreign-currency earnings that Kim needs to continue underwriting the lifestyles of the North Korean upper crust and keeping them happyBut the country is still in its best economic shape in decades with growth of about 2 or 3percent according to private-sector analysts much better than in the years of contraction under his fatherIf Kim who turns 33 on Jan 8 maintains the support of North Koreas top tier he could remain in power for decades to come said Sue Mi Terry a former North Korea analyst at the CIAThe junior Kim has already ruled for five years and could conceivably rule for another 50 years she said if he maintains the support of North Koreas elites the shareholders in his regime  But there will be challengesWhile the elites as a group by and large still support him there are signs of growing discord among the ruling class as it struggles for power and influence Terry said noting that there have been several high-profile defections from the regime this yearBut Kim doesnt just use money to curry favor he uses to instill fear Since he took power at least 100 top-level officials have been purged or executedMost notably he had his own uncle Jang Song Thaek hauled out of a meeting at the end of 2013  broadcast on television  and denounced as a traitor for all ages thenThe elites know that if Kim can turn on his uncle and other high-ranking officers like he did any of them could be next in his gun sights Terry saidCheong Seong Chang a leadership expert at the Sejong Institute outside Seoul said the purges are a sign of Kims strengthIf Kim Jong Uns power base was weak it would have been risky to execute these high-ranking officials he said noting that the younger Kim executed many fewer people than his father did  about 2000  during his own transition period These executions show that he has absolute powerFor one of the worlds most threatening figures very little is known about Kim as a personIntelligence from inside the isolated state is notoriously thin and only a handful of outsiders have met him The only Americans to have spent any time with him are Dennis Rodman the former Chicago Bulls basketball player who visited the country three times and his entourageJoe Terwilliger a New York geneticist who accompanied Rodman on two of his trips said Kim is very different in person from the outside worlds caricature of himHes charming and gregarious and very friendly He told a lot of jokes and we had open conversations about every imaginable topic like hanging out with old friends said Terwilliger who went jet-skiing with Kim at his summer house and sang karaoke in front of him He especially likes sports music and movies and even asked about Sylvester StalloneSince taking over Kim has cultivated an image as a man of the people Hes gone on rides at one of Pyongyangs new amusement parks Unlike his father who never appeared in public with any of his wives Kim is often accompanied by his fashionable spouseKim and Ri who are believed to have two or three young children have visited Pyongyang residents in their apartments sitting on the floor with them Kim has even poured drinks for his hosts  a humble gesture in a culture that prizes seniority and protocolState media shows Kim with a much smaller retinue than his father had and he is tactile often slapping backs and clasping hands a huge smile on his faceExperts have been trying to psychoanalyze North Koreas leaders for decades but its hard given how few clues there are The popular view is of a nuclear-armed madman but such mockery risks underestimating KimPeople like him are not crazy and they are not erratic said Bueno de Mesquita the NYU political scientist They are carefully calculatingBut given Kims capacity for brutality his and his apparently impulsive tendencies there is reason to be concerned about his hot-headedness said Jerrold Post a psychiatrist who founded the CIAs personality analysis centerThis is all about big boys and their big toys Post said I must say Im concerned about words leading to actions between him andIndeed Kim has proved quick to escalate tensions as in the summer of 2015 when a confrontation with South Korea over a land-mine attack brought the two countries to the brink of warThe next two or three years will be critical for Kim analysts say as he solidifies his control and confronts the unconventional Donald Trump administration But if the past is any guide it would be prudent to avoid making predictions about the North Korean regimes imminent demiseThere has been a lot of wishful thinking going on since the 1990s said Gause of CNA Im not saying that their days are not numbered but North Korea is a very resilient country You cant go on expecting the Kim family to crumble Yoonjung Seo contributed to this reportNorth Korea has made no secret of its goal to produce an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the United States mainland giving it the means to send a nuclear warhead to its archenemy Kim Jong Uns rocket scientists are thought to be several years from being able to do this instead concentrating on intermediate-range missiles that can reach only as far as GuamBut now some analysts are asking Did North Korea just try to launch two long-range missilesWe think it is important that people consider the possibility that this was a KN-08 test said Jeffrey Lewis director of the East Asia nonproliferation program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California referring to the intercontinental ballistic missile or ICBM by its technical nameNorth Korea conducted two missile tests earlier this month on Oct 9 and 19 Both took place at an air base in Kusong on North Koreas west coast on the other side of the country from the usual Musudan test site near Wonsan on the east coastThe United States Strategic Command said Wednesday that both tests are presumed to be of Musudan missiles and South Korean military officials have said the same The Musudan is technically capable of flying as far as 2400 miles putting Guam within range and almost reaching AlaskaThese would mark the seventh and eighth Musudan tests this year Only one in June was a success flying about 250miles and reaching a surprisingly high altitude   But after poring over satellite photos enhanced with a near infrared band of light Lewis and his fellow experts at MIIS think theres an even chance that the launches were of ICBMsWere not fully persuaded that it was a Musudan Lewis said noting that Strategic Command known as StratCom twice misidentified three missiles that North Korea launched in SeptemberWe still think people are being too quick to jump to the conclusion that this was a Musudan Even if its only 50/50 being shocked half of the time is still bad he saidLooking at before-and-after satellite imagery from Planet Labs a San Francisco-based imaging company Lewis and his colleagues found burn scars after each missile firing showing where the hot exhaust scorched the pavement and grass Near infrared light can discriminate between burned and untouched parts of vegetationNon-proliferation analysts say that the burn scars suggest a huge explosion(Planet Labs)The first scar is really big That is consistent with a catastrophic failure he said noting that it was possible that the explosion damaged the launch vehicle on which it was mounted The second burn scar is small like the missile flew some distance before whatever went wrongThese big burn scars are much bigger than what had been seen after Musudan tests and the fact that they happened on the other side of the country added to suspicions about the kind of missile being testedOther analysts said it is possible if not probable that the tests were of ICBMsWhile this was most likely a Musudan test the possibility of a KN-08 cannot be ruled out said John Schilling an aerospace engineer who frequently writes about the Norths missiles Schilling expects North Koreas road-mobile ICBMs to reach operational status early in the next decade  perhaps within five yearsIt seems most likely that the latest test was an attempt to test the Musudan from an operational launch facility rather than a test facility he said explaining the difference in test locationAlthough noting that StratCom should be able to distinguish between a Musudan and a much larger ICBM he also pointed out that the US agency had misidentified the three missiles launched last month StratCom first called them short-range Rodongs then medium-range Musudans They turned out to be extended-range Scud missilesI do not place high confidence in their ability to distinguish a KN-08 from a Musudan Schilling said And I do not think anyone should have high confidence in their ability to predict North Korean behavior regarding missile testing   Joseph S Bermudez Jr chief analytics officer at AllSource Analysis a Denver-based consultancy also said the likelihood was that the missiles were medium-range MusudansGiven their concentration on perfecting the Musudan I would think they were testing a Musudan he said saying that the test site could have been moved simply to make it harder for intelligence agencies to monitor the activityAlthough all but one Musudan test has failed North Korea has shown rapid advances with its missile program this year It successfully launched a ballistic missile from a submarine in August and launched what it said was a satellite in February That launch was widely considered a cover for an ICBM testJapans Asahi television network citing an unnamed North Korean military source reported earlier this month that Kim had ordered ICBM development to be finished by the end of this year A spokesman for North Koreas space agency last week pledged that the state would continue working on its peaceful satellite programRegardless of whether this latest test was of medium- or long-range missiles analysts agree that they are cause for concernWhats more concerning is not an individual test or two individual tests its that theyre approaching their missile development in a very pragmatic way Bermudez saidWhat theyre doing is exactly right They are testing and they are testing often he said This is the way you really learn how to develop a ballistic missile and thats what worries me   In the United States there is growing recognition of the increased threat posed by North KoreaJames R Clapper Jr the director of national intelligence said Tuesday that the United States had to assume that North Korea would be able to mount a nuclear warhead on a missile capable of reaching the West Coast of the United StatesWe ascribe to them the capability to launch a missile that would have a weapon on it to reach parts of the United States certainly including Alaska and Hawaii he said in a discussion at the Council on Foreign RelationsThey could do it We have to make the worst-case assumption here he saidClapper also said that trying to persuade North Korea to give up its weapons was now probably a lost cause given that the program was its ticket to survivalEarlier this month Jami Miscik previously a top analyst at the CIA warned against underestimating North Koreas capabilitiesThe fact these rocket launches are failing shouldnt give anyone comfort she said at Fortunes Most Powerful Women summit according to the magazine They fail and they fix that thing and it might fail for another reason but theyre advancing in terms of their capabilityTOKYO How do you solve a problem like North Korea Its a problem that has befuddled American presidents for decadesWell Donald Trump has a new idea In the first debate Monday night the Republican candidate appeared to suggest that China should invade North KoreaYou look at North Korea were doing nothing there Trump said when asked about his policy on nuclear weapons during the debate China should solve that problem for us China should go into North Korea China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea  China responded within hours toTrumps suggestion by saying it has been making unremitting efforts with all sides concerned to resolve the nuclear issue according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang on TuesdayThe idea that China once North Koreas patron now the closest thing it has to a friend (and its not that close) has leverage over North Korea is not newPyongyangs nuclear tests are routinely met with condemnation then sanctions through the United Nations that are aimed at cutting off the regimes ability to get parts for its weapons program or earn the money needed to finance it After this months nuclear test there were many calls for China to get serious about imposing international sanctions on the North  The sanctions are not effective unless Beijing fully implements them cracking down on the Chinese intermediaries that do business with North KoreaBeijing has become increasingly angry during the reign of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and has supported increasingly stringent sanctions but analysts say its ultimate consideration has not changed It does not want the regime to collapse sending millions of hungry North Koreans into China and potentially the 28000 American troops stationed in South Korea right up to its borderBut Trumps suggestion that China go into North Korea took the exhortations for Beijing to act to a whole new level and is a bit of contrast to his own suggestions over the summerRemember that back in June Trump suggested he would deal with North Korea by to Washington  but not for a state dinner just for hamburgers around a conference tableOn Twitter there was widespread disbelief at the idea that a military invasion was the answerDonald Trump just encouraged China to invade North Korea Terry Canales (@TerryCanales40) Indeed analysts poured cold water on the very idea that leaning on China was a new strategyHas the Bush administration not tried to use Chinese leverage to control Pyongyang Has not the Obama administration Eom Sang-yoon a research fellow at the Sejong Institute What Trump is saying is very basic so far he has not provided any details on how his policy will be different from that of Obama Sang-yoon saidBut the Republican candidate did not just stop at China He criticized the Obama administrations nuclear agreement with Iran as the worst deal I think Ive ever seen negotiatedCracking down on North Korea should have been made part of that deal Trump saidIran is one of their biggest trading partners Iran has power over North Korea Trump said When they made that horrible deal with Iran they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North KoreaThat claim had Iran experts scratching their headsTrump  has power over North KoreaKhamenei will wake up finding himself ruling half the world Ariane M Tabatabai (@ArianeTabatabai) Trump also took the opportunity to again insist that Japan and South Korea both American allies should be paying more for their defenseJust to go down the list we defend Japan we defend Germany we defend South Korea we defend Saudi Arabia we defend countries They do not pay us he saidBut they should be paying us because we are providing tremendous service and were losing a fortune saying that we are losing billions and billions of dollars  This isnt 40 years ago where we could do what were doing We cant defend Japan a behemoth selling us cars by the million he saidIn fact these countries do pay for their own defense Japan pays almost $2 billion a year to host American troops on its soil while South Korea pays about $850 million annually We wrote about the costs and benefits of the two alliances earlier this year This is how one former Republican spokesman on the Hill respondedKorea actually pays hundreds of millions of dollars a year for our military Trump knows that Still lied  Brian Walsh (@brianjameswalsh) In Seoul the government broke with normal diplomatic protocol to rebut Trumps remarksOur government normally considers it inappropriate to comment on remarks by a particular [American] presidential candidate Cho June-hyuck spokesman at the Foreign Ministry said at a press briefingNevertheless  I can say that our government has contributed to and played a role in maintaining and strengthening the combined defense capability of South Korea and the US as well as stably stationing US Forces Korea here the spokesman said according to a report from the Yonhap News AgencyMondaymorning Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) a liberal government watchdog organization joined with several prominent law professors to against President Trump alleging that he is in violation of the emoluments clause (aka the foreign emoluments clause) of the Constitution The suit filed in the Southern District of New York seeks a declaratory judgmenton the meaning and application of the clause a ruling that Trump has violated the clause and an injunction prohibiting further violations Those joining CREW in the suit include Harvards Laurence Tribe UC Irvines Erwin Chemerinsky and Fordham Universitys Zephyr Teachout The complaint is One problem for the litigants is that there is virtually no precedent on the  and scholars disagree on  and even  Historical practice provides some guide but its not dispositive There have been a  from the Office of Legal Counsel over the years but they are not entirely consistent with one another While we can  of the clause suggested by some commentators real questions remain about which of the presidents extensive business relationships and interests could give rise to emolument clause violations and under what circumstances (And even if the president is not violating the emoluments clause there are still plenty of reasons to be concerned that his investments create other conflicts of interest and that he should do more to extricate himself from such conflicts but thats a subject for another time This post is focusing on the legal issues)CREW faces a bigger problem than trying to convince a federal court that Trump is violating the Constitution It will first have convince the court that it is entitled to litigate this question at all In order to maintain a suit in federal court a plaintiff must show that the requirements of Article III standing are satisfied In this case CREWs arguments for standing are a stretch In short CREW will have a hard time showing that it has suffered a cognizable injury from Trumps alleged violation of the emoluments clause  an injury that is both actual or imminent as well as concrete and particularized to CREW  let alone that such injury was caused by Trumps conduct and that it is redressable by a favorable court judgmentThe core of CREWs argument for standing is that Trumps violations of the emoluments clause have injured CREW because as an organization dedicated to policing government ethics and misconductthese violations give it more work to do and divert resources from other issuesFrom the complaintCREW brings this action to stop and prevent the violations of the Foreign Emoluments Clause that Defendant Donald J Trump has committed and will commit which have already injuredand without a remediable order from this Court will continue to injureCREW in the form of a significant diversion and depletion of its time resources and efforts CREW has standing under  455 US 363 379 (1982) because there has been a concrete and demonstrable injury to the organizations activities[] with the consequent drain on the organizations resources  6 F3d 898 904-05 (2d Cir 1993)For those familiar with standing law this may seem like an odd argument because if it were accepted in such broad terms it would make standing a non-issue for advocacy organizations of all stripes Environmental organizations for example would be able to assert standing for any and all alleged violations of federal environmental laws on the grounds that such violations injure those groups by forcing them to divert resources to police those violations Instead as anyone remotely familiar with recent standing jurisprudence knows environmental groups often have to go to significant lengths to demonstrate standing lest they be thrown out of court as has happened in cases such asandSimilarly if standing were as easy to establish as CREW suggests we would have expected a different outcome in other cases such as as wellCREWs standing claim is based upon thecase cited above In that case the Supreme Court heldthat a local non-profit Housing Opportunities Made Equal (HOME) had standing to challenge violations of the Fair Housing Act because such violations frustrated HOMEs purpose Specifically HOME operated counseling and referral services to help individuals find homes and advance the cause of increasing housing opportunity and argued that unlawful housing discrimination made it more difficult and costly to perform those functions CREW on the other hand alleges something quite different Whereas HOME had to spend more resources because unlawful discrimination made it more difficult to find homes for those it served CREW claims it has to spend more resources answering press inquiries explaining the emoluments clause to policymakers and the public and hiring an additional attorney so CREW may more effectively counteract Trumps ethical and legal violations In other words CREWs argument is that its injury is having to spend money to file this lawsuit and raise awareness about the issues it presents HOME in the courts words could allege injuries that were far more than simply a setback to the organizations abstract social interests CREW Not so muchAnother important distinction betweenand is that the latter concerneda statute with provisions expressly authorizing private suits to enforce its requirements With this provision Congress made clear it wanted to do as much as possible to facilitate more stringent enforcement of the FHAs terms through private litigation a point Justice Brennan stressed in his opinion for the court Yet there is nothing in the emoluments clausenor in any federal legislation creating a cause of action to enforce the provisions terms let alone the sort of explicit cause of action contained in the FHA This matters because as the court has stressed time and again Congress may create procedural rights that ease the standing burden Without such a statutorily created right however CREWs burden becomes that much greaterThere are other differences between and Josh Blackman identifies some  such as the fact that HOME sought money damages  a form of relief that would clearly redress their alleged injury  whereas CREW does not He also notes that Justice Ginsburg cited toquite a bit in  but that Ginsburg was also writing in dissentPerhaps aware of the standing problem facing this suit CREW decided to file its action in New York within the jurisdiction of the US Court of Appeals for the 2ndCircuit rather than in DC This is likely because in the 2nd Circuit adopted a somewhat more expansive interpretation ofthan have other circuits including the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Yet evendoes not go as far as CREW needs to sustain this suit as the plaintiff organization there raised claims much closer to those of HOME in than CREW does hereStanding is not the only jurisdictional obstacle to CREWs suit even if it is the most substantial Another potential barrier is the Political Question doctrine which further limits the power of the federal courts I will address this doctrine and explain how it might apply to in a follow-up postTRUMP So its been 235 days since crooked Hillary Clinton has had a press conference And you as reporters who give her all of these glowing reports should ask yourselves why And Ill tell you why Because despite the nice platitudes shes been a messYou look at whats happened with ISIS which isnt even mentioned You look at whats happening with law and order they dont even mention our police They mention everybody but our police They dont have an American flag on the dais until we started complaining and then they ran up with two very small little flags one that we sawSo you know I put myself through your news conferences often not that its fun 235 days no news conference for Hillary Clinton You oughta check it out because theres a lot going onHer great disloyalty to the person that rigged the system for her Debbie Wasserman Schultz she totally rigged it Bernie Sanders never had a chanceAnd total disloyalty its like youre fired get out fast The e-mail situation I call it the double e-mail situation both very serious What was said in the last ones to the DNC was horrible absolutely horribleIf I wouldve used language like they used about religion about race about everything else that they discuss in those e-mails I wouldve had to run and hide and probably drop out of the raceWith her everythings just fine So just ask yourself why she doesnt have news conferences And honestly the reason is because theres no way she can answer questions because the job she has done is so badWhen they talk about change I noticed they have change Shes been there for 30 years Thirty years Theres no change Its going to be the same its going to be an extension of Obama In my opinion worse  She lied about TPP She was for TPP she saw me on television knocking the hell out of it because its a horror show its going to kill all our jobs its going to be almost as bad as NAFTA maybe worse which her husband signed by the way which destroyed this country destroyed manufacturing in the United StatesAnd Ill do something about it thatll be so renegotiated And by the way yesterday for the first time she said she wants to renegotiate trade agreements First time yesterday Well because of meShe also saw me talking about TPP and currency manipulation and currency devaluation And she heard it and she said wow she cant win that subject in a debateSo all of a sudden she goes and she goes against TPP her vice president is one of the biggest proponents of TPP and now hes going against it And Bernie Sanders was right he was against itThey will go for TPP and vote it in very shortly after the election if she wins which for the sake of our country we all hope and I hope that she doesnt They will vote it in -- just mark my words hopefully we dont have to worry about it -- but she will voteShell change a comma shell change a paragraph of the 6000 page document that nobodys even read on our side Just so you understand the other countries know every word every paragraph every sentence every single comma and periodWe dont even read it our country Because were led by stupid people so she saw me talking about TPP she realized that she couldnt defend it her special interests are pushing her hard because shes bought and sold by the special interestsTheyre pushing her very hard and so she said shes against it The day she gets in -- which hopefully will never happen -- she will approve or shortly thereafter TPP And that will be another disaster for job in our country OKSo why dont we start off any questions Yes sirQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Its just a total deflection this whole thing with Russia In fact I saw her campaign manager I dont know his title Mook I saw him on television and they asked him about Russia and the hackingBy the way they hacked -- they probably have her 33000 e-mails I hope they do They probably have her 33000 e-mails that she lost and deleted because youd see some beauties there So lets seeBut I watched this guy Mook and he talked about we think it was Russia that hacked Now first of all was what was said on those thats so bad but he said I watched it I think he was live But he said we think it was Russia that hackedAnd then he said -- and this is in person sitting and watching television as Ive been doing -- and then he said could be Trump yeah yeah Trump Trump oh yeah Trump He reminded me of John Lovitz for Saturday Night Live in the liar (ph) where hed go yes yes I went to Harvard Harvard yes yes This is the guy you have to see it Yes it could be Trump yes yes So it is so farfetched Its so ridiculous Honestly I wish I had that power Id love to have that power but Russia has no respect for our countryAnd thats why -- if it is Russia nobody even knows this its probably China or it could be somebody sitting in his bed But it shows how weak we are it shows how disrespected we are Total -- assuming its Russia or China or one of the major countries and competitors its a total sign of disrespect for our country Putin and the leaders throughout the world have no respect for our country anymore and they certainly have no respect for our leader So I know nothing about it Its one of the most farfetched Ive ever heard Yes Jon (ph)QUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I never met Putin I dont know who Putin is He said one nice thing about me He said Im a genius I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it I never met PutinQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I would treat Vladimir Putin firmly but theres nothing that I can think of that Id rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now so that we can go and knock out ISIS together with other people and with other countries Wouldnt it be nice if we actually got along with people wouldnt it be nice if we actually got along as an example with Russia Im all for it and lets go get ISIS because we have to get ISIS and we have to get them fastYou saw what happened with the priest its only going to get worse And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more people from that region into our country and we have no idea who they are where they come from where their documentation is its only going to get worse and its going to start getting bad in our country Were letting people come in by the tens of thousands You see what happened to the French priest A friend of mine he said he was going to France like three four months ago I saw him yesterday I said howd you like France He said I wouldnt go to France I wouldnt go to France Because France is no longer France France is no longer France They wont like me for saying that but you see what happened in Nice you see what happened yesterday with the priest who was supposed to be a spectacular man France is no longer France and this world better be very careful and they better get very tough and very smart and theyll never do it with Hillary ClintonAnd by the way in terms of change shes been there for 30 years Shes been doing this for 30 years What shes going to go all of sudden things are going to change Shes bought and sold 100 percent by special interests and lobbyists Yes Tom (ph)QUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP None noneQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Because its under order And Ill release them when the audits completed Nobody would release when its under -- Ive had audits for 15 or 16 years Every year I have a routine audit Im under audit when the audits complete Ill release them But zero I mean I will tell you right now zero I have nothing to do with Russia yesQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I dont know I dont know It depends on the audit It depends on the audit not a big deal By the way just so you understand Ive released my papers 104 pages of documents I built an unbelievable company tremendous cash tremendous company with some of the great assets of the world Youve seen it You were all very disappointed when you saw it actually but thats OK Far far great than anybody ever thought I have a great company I built an unbelievable company but if you look there youll see theres nothing in RussiaAnd as far as the tax returns as soon as the audits complete like any lawyer would tell you Greta Van Susteren she was going over it a while ago shes a lawyer She said well no lawyer would let somebody release a tax return when theyre under audit Its a routine audit Ive gone through audits which I think is very unfair for 15 years I have friends that are very rich and never get audited Im audited every year Maybe thats because of politics who knowsQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Im not going to tell Putin what to do Why should I tell Putin what to do He already did something today where he said dont blame them essentially for your incompetence Let me tell you its not even about Russia or China or whoever it is thats doing the hacking It was about the things that were said in those e-mails They were terrible things talking about Jewish talking about race talking about atheist trying to pin labels on people -- what was said was a disgrace and it was Debbie Wasserman Schultz and believe me as sure as youre sitting there Hillary Clinton knew about it She knew everything  Debbie Wasserman Schultz could not breathe without speaking and getting approval from Hillary Clinton Couldnt breathe And you saw that It also showed that it was a fixed race but Ive been saying that long before I saw the e-mails It was a rigged race It was totally rigged And Debbie Wasserman Schultz rigged it for Hillary Clinton and the sad part is Bernie Sanders has to use an old word that I use on occasion hes lost his energy He wants to go home and go to sleep But hes got a lot of people that walked out last night Now hundreds of people walked out of the Democrat Convention last night I didnt even hear about it Nobody showed it I didnt see it on television You people dont talk about itThe Republican Convention was incredible I hear I had one of the biggest bounces in decades Like some people are saying nine points In fact a poll just came out ten minutes ago Los Angeles Times Trump 47 Clinton 40 And the reason is that people are sick and tired of Hillary ClintonQUESTION (inaudible) Putin (ph) say stay out Why not say thatTRUMP Why do I have to (ph) get involved with Putin I have nothing to do with Putin Ive never spoken to him I dont know anything about him other than he will respect me He doesnt respect our president And if it is Russia -- which its probably not nobody knows who it is -- but if it is Russia its really bad for a different reason because it shows how little respect they have for our country when they would hack into a major party and get everything But it would be interesting to see -- I will tell you this -- Russia if youre listening I hope youre able to find the 30000 e-mails that are missing I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press Lets see if that happens Thatll be next Yes sirQUESTION (inaudible) this audience and make (ph) your campaign -- what exactly do you believe should happen to minimum wage in this country (inaudible)OK Sure Two big questions The minimum wage has to go up People are -- at least $10 but it has to go up But I think that states -- federal -- I think that states should really call the shot As an example I live in New York Its very expensive in New York You cant buy a hot dog for the money youre talking about You go to other states and its not expensive at all Now what it does is puts New York at a disadvantage if the minimum wage is up companies move out and things bad things happen At the same time people have to be taken care of But what Im really going to do on the minimum wage -- but it has to go upNow Bernie Sanders lied Bernie Sanders said in his speech the other day that Donald Trump wants the minimum wage to go below $7 I said where did he come up with that one That one is just like Joe Biden lied today He said that Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb -- he was on television -- he said Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb the enemy in the Middle East Now that was Ted Cruz that said that That was not Donald Trump I mean hes not a very bright guy but that was Ted Cruz that said it And he said it with such surety -- Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb -- I never said I wanted to carpet bomb That was Ted Cruz You remember Ted Cruz said it You will confirm that I think Go aheadSo I would like to raise it to at least $10 and what Im going to do is Im going to bring jobs back to this country so that people can start working again so that the $10 and the $15 and the numbers youre talking about are going to -- literally theyre going to be peanuts compared to what people can make in the country because Im going to bring jobs back from Mexico which is booming booming I have a friend who builds plants and hes a great builder of plants and I was with him the other day -- great guy He builds massive plants for automobiles for computers for anything Thats what he does I think hes the biggest but certainly one of the biggestAnd I said hows it going He said unbelievable Oh good thats good news The countrys doing well No the countrys not doing well but Mexico is unbelievable The plants Im building in Mexico Ive never seen anything -- its the eighth wonder of the world And hes not happy Hes an American guy Hed rather build them here But he said its unbelievable Thats whats happened to our country Because we have leadership that doesnt know what theyre doingQUESTION (inaudible) special extreme vettingTRUMP Yes were going to be listing yeah were going to be giving a list of those territories And if you come from those territories we have extreme vetting And were going to have extreme vetting anyway Look we have people coming into this country who have very evil intentions And we have people whether in San Bernardino or whether its the World Trade Center or whether its a lot of other things and you look all over the world and you see whats happeningYou look at Orlando how bad was that And that was horrible That was going after the gay community it looks like We cant let this happen We cannot let this happen We cannot let people come inNow Hillary Clinton likes to up it Her running mate Tim Kaine who by the way did a terrible job in New Jersey First act he did in New Jersey was ask for a $4 billion tax increase and hes not very popular in New Jersey And he still isnt WhatI mean Virginia The first thing he did the first thing that Tim Kaine did he asked for a $4 billion tax increase And hes not very popular So let me just tell you and I went all over Virginia and I was there the other day And I thought hed be popular Hes not popular because he asked for tax increases Big tax increases in Virginia Big And also the unemployment went up I think it doubled or close to doubled during his tenureBut what he wanted to do is very strongly and hes on record he wanted to have even more of the people from that region of the world come in than Hillary Clinton wants And its unacceptable OK Yes (inaudible)QUESTION Shortly ago prosecutors in Baltimore announced they were dropping all the chargesTRUMP I saw thatQUESTION Against police involved in the Freddie Gray caseTRUMP RightQUESTION Your reaction (inaudible)TRUMP I do have a reaction to the prosecutor in Baltimore who indicted those police officers I do I think she ought to prosecute herself OK Thats my reaction I think it was disgraceful what she did and the way she did it And the news conference that she had where they were guilty before anybody even knew the factsAnd I give a lot of respect and a lot of credit to those police officers who probably could have made a deal I give a lot of respect a lot of credit that they stuck it out And you had victory after victory after victory And she had no chance dont forget she prosecuted the best case what she thought was her best cases first She should prosecute herself She should be held accountableQUESTION (inaudible) to Americans who feel like this was kind of a railroad case Freddie Gray is now a cause celebreTRUMP Well that was a bad case to prove it That was a bad case I mean if youre going to do that its OK because you have to you know there are times when police officers behave very badly But you have to get the right time This was not one of those times And I think that she is a disgrace to the world of prosecutors for what she did Yes maamQUESTION So as youve gotten to know Governor Pence what surprises you most about himTRUMP YeahQUESTION And (inaudible)TRUMP I have a great relationship with Governor Pence We spent the last three days together He was absolutely my first choice and I never wavered despite the press The press was saying and it was interesting I spoke to him at 1105 him and his wife and I told him that I was going to be choosing them if Id be lucky enough for him to accept And he accepted And that was it For me that was itBut right around that time you had the attack in Nice And I was going to have a news conference either the following morning or the next day And of course I had to delay the news conference because there was attack a horrible attack horrible In France And I delayed the news conference and everyone said oh hes having second thoughts I never had a second thought in my life It was such a lie I mean so many lies in the press But it was such a lie And he has been so great Honestly hes been even better than I thought OK BetterQUESTION Do you think the Geneva Convention are out of dateTRUMP I think everythings is out of date We have a whole new world When I said that NATO to Wolf Blitzer is obsolete I got attacked Three days later people that study NATO said you know Trump is right You know what We have a lot of things that are out date because theyre 20 and 30 and 40 years oldNATO you know this isnt a country from 40 years ago Today we have a different threat We have a terror threat And we have an ISIS threat And by the way ISIS isnt even mentioned Its not even mentioned during the Democratic Convention And everyones talking about it The reason they cant mention it is because they grew itGo aheadQUESTION What would you renegotiate the enhanced interrogation aspect of it TheTRUMP I would -- Katy I would renegotiate so much of everything Im going to renegotiate our trade deals where were losing with everybody Katy Im going to renegotiate our military deals where were protecting countries and theyre not living up to the bargain Theyre not living up to the bargain And everyone agrees with me except for the mediaAnd the media never says that I like NATO just so you understand I like NATO I like the concept of NATO It is somewhat outdated because it doesnt cover terror the way it should Ive been saying this for six months now A couple of months ago front page Wall Street Journal We are going to cover terror they announced (ph) somebodyI think NATOs great But its got to be modernized And -- and countries that were protecting have to pay what theyre supposed to be payingQUESTION On the Geneva Convention (inaudible)TRUMP YesQUESTION Do you think that they should allow for that given the (inaudible)TRUMP I am a person that believes in enhanced interrogation yesAnd by the way it worksQUESTION (inaudible) will you defend the Baltic states if theyre invaded by Russia According toTRUMP Ill tell you what Let me say it once again Let me say it once again OK Many countries including the NATO countries some of which I think you have five that are current that have paid what they owe And they can afford to pay this Its not like they cant afford itThey just see us as a soft touch You know in business we say somebodys a soft touch I dont know if Ive been called a soft touch but maybe I have sometimes But in business they call them a soft touch They havent paid us OK I want them to payExcuse me Im not saying anything I dont talk Im not like Obama where he tells you everything hes going to do -- were going to go and do this were going to go and do that I dont talk But theyre going to payNo no -- yeah it sends a signal You know what signal it says It says were going to payYou know somebody said but we have treaties I said thats right And in the treaties theyre supposed to pay Theyre going to pay And they will pay They will pay(CROSSTALK)TRUMP YesQUESTION (inaudible) how are you planning to (inaudible)TRUMP Were going to have a whole policy on that over the next three weeks Im going to be doing a big thing on that(CROSSTALK)TRUMP Well Ive been doing very well with the Hispanic community I mean really well I mean the -- the poll numbers are going up very high I think we had one recently 35 or 36 But Im going to have a whole -- were going to have a news conference on that over the next three weeksSo and I want to just tell you because these polls cover it so LA Times 47-40 CNN way up Theyre all way up Biggest -- they say the biggest bounce in memory Because today I heard a dishonest guy on television say Well Trump didnt get much of a bounce So you know I have to at least sayJeremy go aheadQUESTION (inaudible) do you believe that Vladimir Putin would rather deal with President Trump or President ClintonTRUMP I dont think he respects Clinton I dont think Putin has any respect whatsoever for Clinton I think he does respect me And I hope I get along great with him Its possible that we wont Jeremy I hope that we get along great with Putin because it would be great to have Russia with a good relationshipRight now we dont have a good relationship Putin has said things over the last year that are really bad things OK He mentioned the N word one time I was shocked to hear him mention the N word You know what the N word is right He mentioned it I was shockedHe has a total lack of respect for President Obama Number one he doesnt like him And number two he doesnt respect him I think hes going to respect your president if Im elected And I hope he likes meYes Yes sirQUESTION (inaudible) relationsTRUMP Yes sir(CROSSTALK)TRUMP But let me finish with Jeremy Go aheadQUESTION Would a President Trump be better for US-Russia relations than (inaudible)TRUMP President Trump would be so much better for US-Russian relations You cant be worse Hey look when I was a young men studying history and studying all of these things that Ive always found fascinating one thing that Ive always heard is you never want to do anything to unite Russia and China Well theyre united now in a true sense Theyve never been closerTheyre selling oil to China We forced them into this position(CROSSTALK)TRUMP No wait a minute(CROSSTALK)TRUMP No Im not going to be an adversary No not at all I have tenants from China I have the biggest bank in the world from China paying me rent I mean I have great relationships with China Im not blaming China for getting away with murder Im blaming our leadership is incompetent We dont know what were doingI dont blame -- I respect China Hey if China can get away with trade deficits every year of hundreds of billions of dollars -- if they can get away with that my hats off to themI have no problem with China I have a problem with our incompetent leadership allowing that to happen And I believe that Hillary Clinton is even more bought and paid for than Barack Obama I think it will get worseIts going to be four more years of Obama which is unacceptable to a lot of people you see that But I believe that Hillary Clinton will be worse than ObamaYesQUESTION (OFF-MIKE) you mentioned that you wanted to make college education more affordableTRUMP Thats rightQUESTION Working on a planTRUMP Thats right Im going to be doing something over the next four weeks very much soQUESTION Are you prepared to give us any sort ofTRUMP No Im prepared to say were gonna have a great plan One of the things I think because Ive traveled all over the country and Im going -- you know where Im going I guess you all know I dont have to sayBut Im going to Toledo (ph) and Im going to different places today and Ive met so many people This is such a great country these are such great people one of the saddest things I see are college students that work so hard that go to colleges good colleges theyre good students they do a great jobNumber one they get out they have no jobs Because our jobs are going to Mexico theyre going to China theyre going to Japan theyre going all over the place Theyre not coming here Just like my friend who builds the plants but he doesnt build them here muchAnd the saddest thing I see is these students are leveraged debt up to their -- up to their neck They cant breathe theyre scared theyre so scared they have leveraged their entire life They have loansAnd I have to tell you the colleges are viewing the students as just a con to it Because the students get government money passes through but the number gets higher and higherBecause college costs are out of control because the colleges say what difference does it make If you take a look at the salaries being paid you take a look at whats going on with the collegesBecause all of this is a pass through and the students are a con to it So the colleges are costing so much money We are going to help the students Maybe that doesnt fit beautifully within the Republican frameworkBut I told this during various times to lots of different people and nobody has a problem with it We have to help our students Our students are under tremendous pressure to a point where its making them sickOur students are under tremendous pressure we have to help our students And Im going to have a plan over the next four weeks(CROSSTALK)QUESTION (OFF-MIKE) talking about possiblyTRUMP Everythings on the table youll see Everything -- its a very important -- its a very important subjectYes maamQUESTION Mr Trump (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I think my message is resonating because they have confidence on me at the border if they dont want people pouring into our country Likewise they have confidence with me on ISIS not only in terms of getting rid of them but also in terms of keeping them out of our country because I will not have people come into our country who want to do damage to our peopleI think they have a lot of confidence in terms of my bringing back jobs because I see Carrier and I see Ford and I see all of these companies leaving and going to Mexico like theres nothing to it And then they make their product they sell it back to the United States no tax no nothing we get nothing except unemploymentAnd I think people see that I can tell you I mean Im like a pollster myself when Im in front of these massive audiences one of the things that gets constantly -- you people know because youre there -- the biggest applause is a repeal and replacement of ObamacareBecause Obamacare is a disaster In Texas going through BlueCross/BlueShield they just announced a 60 percent increase On November 1st youre going to have new numbers come out for Obamacare having to do with increases President Obama is trying to get it moved to December Because it is election-defying It is going to be a massive number the biggest number ever in our countrys history for health care Its going to be announced on November 1stI just asked the press dont let him do that Obamacare is a disaster people are dying with it Its a disaster and everybody knows and its going to fold anywayIn 17 unfortunately -- if Im president -- I mean Ive got to take over this mess Its going to fold anyway But repeal and replace Obamacare people like itThey like the fact that Im going to protect the Second Amendment they like the fact that Im going to rebuild our military which is very depleted Those are the things that are resonatingAnd they dont feel Hillary Clinton can do itJohn (ph) go ahead John (ph)QUESTION (OFF-MIKE) Russia has no business in you -- that you dont have anyTRUMP No I have nothing to do with Russia John (ph) How many times do I have say that Are you a smart man I have nothing to with Russia I have nothing to do with RussiaAnd even -- for anything What do I have to do with Russia You know the closest I came to Russia I bought a house a number of years ago in Palm Beach FloridaPalm Beach is a very expensive place There was a man who went bankrupt and I bought the house for $40 million and I sold it to a Russian for $100 million including brokerage commissions So I sold it So I bought it for 40 I told it for 100 to a Russian That was a number of years ago I guess probably I sell condos to Russians OKQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Of course I can I told you other than normal stuff -- I buy a house if I sold it to a Russian I have nothing to do with Russia I said that Putin has much better leadership qualities than Obama but who doesnt know thatQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Of course not I own the Trump organization Zero zero Go aheadQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I amQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I didQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I did Because I would love to see a woman become president of the United States But she would be so wrong And even women say that Women dont like her She would be so wrong Look Hillary Clinton is a disaster Shes been a disaster And even the story told by her husband last night he left out the most interesting chapter I wont get into thatThe chapter that I really waited for because it was pretty boring the chapter that I waited for I never heard And he left it out Look Hillary Clintons a disaster Id love to see a woman become president and itll happen absolutely But I think it would be bad for women if it were Hillary Clinton Yes maam (ph)QUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Yes I doQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP But I have spoken to about many times and I speak about it all the time and the police have to be very careful they have to be very very well trained I speak about it all the time in fact I mentioned the most recent death excuse me I mentioned the most recent deaths in Louisiana and in Minnesota I speak about it all the time Its a real problem because if the police do 100000 great jobs and they have one either a rogue policeman or a cop who was poorly trained or did a bad job you see that incident on television for weeks Its a real problemYou dont see the good work that they do but if they make one mistake out of 100000 out of more than that its on television night after night after night The police in this country do an amazing job but likewise I agree and I do mention that all the time Yes maam go aheadQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Oh go ahead go aheadQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP YesQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP No but they seem to be if its Russians I have no idea Its probably not Russia Nobody knows if its Russia You know the sad thing is That with the technology and the genius we have in this country not in government unfortunately but with the genius we have in government we dont even know who took the Democratic National Committee e-mails We dont even know who it isI heard this morning one report said they dont think its Russia they think it might be China Another report said it might be just a hacker some guy with a 200 IQ that cant get up in the morning OK Nobody knows Honestly they have no idea if its Russia Might be Russia But if its any foreign country it shows how little respect they have for the United States Yes maamQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP YesQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Well and (ph) the biggest thing is number one we have to stop by keeping people out because these people theyve got something bad going on up there Thats something really bad going on And then people in terms of Islam and radical Islamic terrorism a term that our president refuses to use I cant hes still not using it Hes still not using it And she doesnt want to use it other than I forced her into maybe using it She said she will use it but so far she didntShell probably use it tonight Like the American flags as soon as we put out a thing they ran a couple of American flags up in the stage it was a disgrace You had a room with a massive stage without flags I think this -- I think that the people in the community know whats going on Whether its in a mosque or whether its in the community and they have to report these people When you look at San Bernardino people knew -- many people knew what was going on They had bombs lying all over the floor They had bombs on the floor I mean this isnt -- you walk into somebodys house there are bombs lying on the floor -- I think theres a problem there You got to report itAnd by the way David Hinckley should not have been freed OK David Hinckley was just released -- John Hinckley -- I think that John Hinckley -- excuse me John Hinckley should not have been freed I just heard about it(CROSSTALK)QUESTION Do you have any pause (ph) about asking a foreign government -- Russia China anybody -- to interfere to hack into the system of anybodys in this countryTRUMP Thats up to the President Let the President talk to them Look heres the problem Heres the problem Katy (ph) Katy heres the problem very simple He has no respectQUESTION (inaudible) 30000 e-mailsTRUMP Well they probably have them Id like to have them releasedQUESTION Does that not give you pauseTRUMP No it gives me no pause If they have them they have them We might as well -- hey you know what gives me more pause That a person in our government crooked Hillary Clinton -- heres what gives me pause Be quiet I know you want to save her That a person in our government Katy would delete or get rid of 33000 e- mails That gives me a big problem After she gets a subpoena She gets subpoenaed and she gets rid of 33000 e-mails That gives me a problem (ph) Now if Russia or China or any other country has those e-mails I mean to be honest with you Id love to see them(CROSSTALK)QUESTION A question about Mike Pence because The New York Times reported that (inaudible) conversation with John Kasichs campaign (inaudible) says you can be the most powerful (inaudible)TRUMP Thats the most ridiculous conversation He never had the -- Don Jr told me -- let me just tell you Let me save you a lot of boredomQUESTION (inaudible) Mike Pences role as vice president if you are electedTRUMP Mike Pence will play a big role but I just want to tell you about John Kasich I never spoke to him about being vice president We dont have good chemistry together I have never spoken to him about being vice president I would never pick him to be vice president There was never a conversation and he has a habit of doing things like this where he says things that may be a little bit shaky He never spoke -- Don Jr would never -- and that was so long ago I didnt even know I was going to get the nomination at that point Just so you understand I would not have picked John Kasich wouldnt be the right guy I mean for that to have gotten out that was so ridiculous And then I was going to put him in charge of national and worldwide policy So whats left for the president I think you know me better than that That was put out by him Hes a nice man John Kasich hes fine Hes fine I would never have chosen himNow I did speak to various people and I actually got acceptances from many people There are some people that called me that very much wanted to be vice president but I picked a man that I have a lot of respect for and Mike Pence is doing a great jobLet me just explain -- I never asked John Kasich to be vice president nor would I And by the way Im leading in Ohio by three pointsQUESTION (inaudible)TRUMP It probably has It probably has Our government is so weak on this stuff It probably has Possible I mean I have a lot of checks and balance I have a good system I guess Im not an e- mail person myself I dont believe in it because I think it can be hacked for one thing But when I send an e-mail I mean if I send one I send one almost never Im just not a believer in e-mail A lot of people have taught me that including Hillary But honestly it could be maybe its hacked Who knowsQUESTION (inaudible) broken the rules in traditional American politics many times (ph) (inaudible) while the other personTRUMP Yes but my message wasnt dark My message was optimistic because were going to fix the problems Go aheadQUESTION (inaudible)TRUMP OKQUESTION Youve broken that tradition youve run a very aggressive campaign this week (ph) What was the basis for wanting to do it this way as opposed to staying quietTRUMP No basis No basisLook John I didnt have to do this When I did this believe me -- you see this incredible resort Its one of the great in the world When I did this I could be here enjoying myself I dont have to be with you guys I didnt need this I have places that are the best in the world OK I could be doing other things Im doing this because were going to make America great again Im doing this because when I looked at the Iran deal which was incompetent -- when I looked at whats going on with jobs being torn out of our country and going to Mexico and China whats happening with China And with all of this with ISIS with our military being so badly depleted where we have old fighter jets We have to take parts from museums and from graveyardsWhen I look at all this I say I sort of have to do it You know this countrys been great to me Im giving back Thats allNow as far as running a campaign I guess its probably not typical But they said that against you know when I ran there was 17 people a total of 17 Governors Senators Ben Carson whos a fantastic guy capable people Wait a minute Everybody said oh he can never win because look what hes doing Hes giving a talk to 5000 people in New Hampshire instead of going to everybodys house and having dinnerAnd then I won New Hampshire And then I won you know 38 or 39 states And won by the way not by a little bit Won with the highest vote in the history of the Republican Party So justQUESTION (inaudible)TRUMP OK but John but the point is this so its a different kind of a campaign But its what I think is good I think its good I think its working here tooQUESTION But this aggressive counterprogramming the Democratic Convention is different than what weve seen in previous campaigns And Im wondering why you felt the need to make sure that everything that was said was responded to immediately with personal appearances with campaign appearances while they were (inaudible)TRUMP Well when Joe Biden says that I want to firebomb the enemy which was on television this morning or carpet bomb He used the term carpet bomb When he makes the statement that Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb I never said that That was Ted Cruz that said that OK That was Ted Cruz wasnt meWhen Sanders and I think a lot of his people are going to come to me because of trade But when Bernie Sanders makes a statement that I wanted to go lower than the minimum wage lower its a lie So I have a choice All my people say dont respond to it it doesnt matter I say to me it does matter It mattersWhen people tell lies politicians who tell lies very well thats what they do thats why theyre politicians But when politicians tell lies and Im lucky in a sense because I have a big microphone In other words I can say that Biden lied when he said that Or I can say that I didnt say that Bernie Sanders And you guys know that I didnt In fact he was criticized by people that fact check for saying it because I never said itSo its nice to be able to President Obama said a year-and-a- half ago Donald Trump will never be president Today on The Today Show he said this is democracy A little bit different Little bit different(LAUGHTER)David go ahead DaveQUESTION Last night at the Democratic Convention (inaudible) women

Universe 4 or 5 years ago in Russia It was a tremendous success Very very successful And there were developers in Russia that wanted to put a lot of money into developments in Russia And they wanted us to do it But it never worked outFrankly I didnt want to do it for a couple of different reasons But we had a major developer particular but numerous developers that wanted to develop property in Moscow and other places But we decided not to do it(CROSSTALK)TRUMP Yes maam go aheadQUESTION (inaudible) President Obama has said that you would never win the presidency Last night he said that anything is possibleTRUMP He did say thatQUESTION What is your reaction to thatTRUMP Well I just said sort of said that He just said that He said it this morning anythings possible I think Im going to win I think people are sick and tired of incompetence Theyre sick and tired of having politicians leading them down the tubes Whether its taxes whether its debt whether its any one of 15 different things And thats why I mean I think Ill win the election I think youll see that in the pollsAll right a few more questions Go ahead JohnQUESTION Back in DecemberTRUMP I hope your arms OKQUESTION Its all right Back in December sir you had said that you were probably going to be going to Israel to go and meet the leadership Now that you are the Republican nominee it is a tradition once you secure the Partys nomination to do a tripTRUMP Well its a tradition but I dont do things that are traditional But I have great support from Israel I will back Israel 100 percent I would like to go there But I have great relationships as you know to the people in IsraelAnd by the way Obama in my opinion is the single worst thing politically speaking thats ever happened to Israel He has been a disaster for Israel(CROSSTALK)TRUMP I dont know I dont know I havent set my schedule yet It could happenQUESTION (inaudible) you are the nominee Has you or your campaign had any conversations with foreign leaders

all very muchQUESTION (Inaudible) running for the president (inaudible)TRUMP Might as well tell him to have a good time He has done one bad jobOK thank you everybodyOn Monday night on CNN Carl Bernstein made this proclamation The president and his presidency is in chaosIts a remarkable statement given that we are only 11 days into the presidency of Donald Trump Its also very hard to disputeConsider this amazing and I do mean amazing WaPo story today about  The story details the infighting and blame game among Trumps top advisers and includes some eye-popping linesAmong them* Defense Secretary James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly fumed privately to associates over the weekend because they had been caught unaware by a travel ban that was drafted and set into action largely in secret by the White House according to three people who have spoken with them*The problem theyve got is this is an off-Broadway performance of a show that is now the number one hit on Broadway said former House speaker Newt Gingrich of the Trump administration (Sidebar Gingrich is an informal adviser to Trump)*A little bit of under-competence and a slight amount of insecurity can breed some paranoia and backstabbing one White House official said of White House chief of staff Reince Priebus We have to get Reince to relax into the job and become more competent because hes seeing shadows where there are no shadowsAny one of those lines is problematic in a normal White House The quote from an anonymous White House official about Priebus who let me emphasize is the  is stunning If that line was used in House of Cards I would roll my eyes and say it would never happen in real lifeAnd its not just the Post story that shows the seeming tumult among Trumps senior advisers A  in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday details how Department of Homeland Security chief John Kelly is at odds with the White House over staffing in his organization A Vanity Fair  details the struggles of Trump son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner as he seeks to exert influence over the presidentRead any one of those stories and the word chaos jumps to mind Or turmoil Or dissension All of them convey the same thing Less than two weeks into his presidency there is a knife fight happening daily among Trumps top aidesBernstein clearly meant his chaos comments in a negative way Chaos in traditional political thinking is bad It suggests a president who doesnt really have control over his people and a White House that resembles a roller coaster car shuddering as it travels at too high a speed down the tracksAnd maybe thats all true Its possible that the Trump train is on the verge of jumping the tracks (Mixed metaphor alert)But every indication from what we know of Trump the businessman and reality TV star suggests that he revels in the chaos that he believes the chaos produces just the sort of results he likesThink back to the boardroom on The Apprentice Bring everybody in Let them attack one another and level allegations Consult with a few of your consiglieres  and then make a bold and often unpredictable decision Yes that was a TV show But it was a TV show created by Trump (and Mark Burnett) That means that the way the show worked came directly out of Trumps brain and generally speaking represents his view of how things should workRemember that for Trump appearances matter most And he likes the perception of himself as the decider the buck-stopper the only one who can cut through all of the noise and battling egos to make the call In order to make that image truly work you need noise around you at all times So Trump put in place a senior leadership team that would create itThe other important point here is that Trump believes all of life business and politics included amounts to a sort of survival of the fittest/toughest His critique of Hillary Clintons health during the 2016 campaign was based on the idea that anyone who has a weak moment as Clinton did at a 9/11 memorial service cant possibly be up to the top job in the country For Trump the constant battles between his aides are a sort of real-life Survivor episode The toughest SOB is the one Trump wants And only through political combat can that be determinedThe combination of chaos combat and constant sniping is not a bad thing in the worldview of Donald Trump In fact it is the one truly necessary thingIn the three years before he became Donald Trumps chief strategist Stephen K Bannon lived as a virtual nomad in a quest to build a populist political insurgency No presidential adviser in recent memory has followed such a mysterious peripatetic path to the White House It was as though he was a man with no fixed addressHe owned a house and condo in Southern California where he had entertainment and consulting businesses a drivers license and a checking account He claimed Florida as his residence registering to vote in Miami and telling authorities he lived at the same address as his third ex-wifeAt the same time he routinely stayed in Washington and New York as he engineered the expansion of Breitbart News and hosted a live Breitbart radio program By 2015 Bannon stayed so often at Breitbarts townhouse headquarters on Capitol Hill that he kept a picture of a daughter on a mantle piece beneath a portrait of Abraham Lincoln Bannon told a friend that year he was living in multiple cities including Washington New York London and Miami according to an email obtained by The Washington PostThe issue of Bannons legal residency has been simmering since last summer shortly after he became chief executive of Trumps campaign  that he was registered to vote at a then-vacant house and speculated that Bannon may have signed an oath that he was a Florida resident to take advantage of the states lack of state income taxesIn California where Bannon had lived and owned property for more than two decades income tax can exceed 12 percentBannon has not responded to repeated requests by The Washington Post to discuss the matter Two Post reporters sought to independently verify his residency claims using a wide array of publicly available information They obtained utility bills court records real estate transactions state driver reports and the checks he wrote to pay municipal taxes in California They interviewed neighbors spoke with landlords and tracked his Breitbart-related activityIn the digital age when most Americans leave a clear footprint of their whereabouts Bannon left a meandering trail filled with ambiguity contradictions and questions The Post found that Bannon left a negligible footprint in Florida He did not get a Florida drivers license or register a car in the state He never voted in Florida and neighbors near two homes he leased in Miami said they never saw him His rent and utility bills were sent to his business manager in California Bannons former wife occupied the premises according to a landlord and neighborsAt the same time Bannon said he was living with his ex-wife she was under investigation for involvement in a plot to smuggle drugs and a cellphone into a Miami jail a law enforcement document obtained by The Post shows The Post learned that state prosecutors in Miami have an active investigation into Bannons assertions that he was a Florida resident and qualified to vote in the state from 2014 to 2016 In late August investigators subpoenaed Bannons lease of a Coconut Grove home and other documents They also contacted the landlords of that home and another that Bannon leased nearby and sought information from a gardener and handyman who worked at one of the homes according to documents and interviewsBecause state laws do not clearly define residency making a false registration case can be difficult  A former investment banker and Hollywood producer Bannon lived in California when he took a turn toward politics nearly a decade ago He had a condo in Los Angeles and a house just to the south in Laguna Beach in Orange County In 2010 he told Orange County election officials that he wanted to become a permanent absentee voter and have all ballots mailed to his Laguna Beach homeIn 2011 Bannon produced and directed a political documentary about Sarah Palin for the Victory Film Project a company in Sarasota Fla He is listed as a manager of the company in Florida corporate records In March 2012 with the death of founder Andrew Breitbart Bannon became executive chairman of the Los Angeles-based Breitbart News which was expanding its operations to Washington Bannon was still a resident of California records show In the November 2012 elections he voted in Orange County by absentee ballot That same month he renewed his California drivers license for five yearsBut in his subsequent travels across the country his living situation became more complicated The details gathered by The Post create uncertainty about where exactly he was spending the bulk of his timeOn Feb 9 2013 Bannon and Diane Clohesy his former third wife signed a lease application for a three-bedroom house on Opechee Drive in a lush Miami neighborhood with palm trees and Spanish-style homes Bannon signed as applicant and Clohesy signed as applicants spouseThe two were married in 2006 when Bannon was 53 and Clohesy was 36 They divorced in California in 2009 She had moved to Florida in 2008 starting a new life in Miami Bannon said in court papers during the divorce But the two remained in touch and she worked on three political documentaries he directed in 2011 and 2012 Bannon told his new landlords that he would be splitting his time between California and Florida according to interviews The Post conducted with the property owners Bannon and Clohesy both signed the two-yearlease records showThe lease application said Bannon was relocating from California But Devin Kammerer the real estate agent who represented Bannon and Clohesy said he never met Bannon in person and only sent him listings by emailIt was Diane who made the decisions about where she wanted to be and shed send over listings to Steve for his approval Kammerer said Diane was very clear on what she wanted The $4900 monthly rent was a big jump for Clohesy who declared on the lease application that her most recent apartment had cost her $950 a month documents show But by his own account Bannon could afford it He stated on the application that he earned $750000 a year as chairman of Breitbart News Network a figure that has not been previously reported He also earned $270000 as executive chairman of Arc Entertainment a film distribution company based in Santa Monica Calif In addition Bannon received about $100000 in salary that year as part-time chairman of the Government Accountability Institute a new nonprofit charity in Tallahassee according to filings with the Internal Revenue Service Bannon two Breitbart writers and other conservative activists had launched the organization a year earlier and it produced reports and books that were promoted by Breitbart Bannon claimed he worked 30 hours a week at GAI according to IRS filingsJust weeks after signing the Opechee Drive lease Bannon launched Breitbart News Sunday with Stephen K Bannon a three-hour program broadcast live Sunday nights from SiriusXM studios in Washington In May 2013 Bannon opened an account in his name for municipal sewer and water service at the Opechee Drive residence documents showThe utility account is one of the few public indications of Bannons presence in Florida But Bannon told utility officials to mail the bills to the office of his business manager on Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills Calif according to documents obtained through Florida public records lawsFour neighbors told The Post they do not recall seeing Bannon at the houseI never saw him said Steven Chastain who lived a few doors away on a nearby street He wasnt living there said Barbara Pope a longtime resident who often walked her dog on Opechee Drive I would have recognized him At the time Bannon was sharing the lease with Clohesy in Opechee she was apparently involved with another man Neighbors said they repeatedly saw a man they could not identify at the house She filed for a restraining order against Jose A Cabana in 2012 He filed one against her in May 2013 court records show She was granted a two-year injunction against him and his complaint was dropped after he failed to appear in court Cabana was charged with cocaine distribution in November 2013 and sentenced to 10 years in prison He could not be reached for commentIn October 2013 Clohesy became ensnared in an undercover investigation of a jail guard suspected of smuggling drugs and other contraband to another man a friend of hers in the Miami-Dade County Pre-trial Detention Center according to an arrest warrant for the jail guard Investigators eavesdropping on a phone call between Clohesy and the inmate heard them arrange for her to deliver a pop tart  code for a cellphone  along with several ounces of marijuana to a prison guard the warrant said Clohesy who was under surveillance later met with the guard in a parking lot and handed over the marijuana the phone and $700 in cash the warrant said Clohesy was confronted by authorities and agreed to cooperate She told investigators she had known the inmate for more than a year and maintained a relationship with him through jail visits correspondence and telephone conversationsEfforts to reach Clohesy were unsuccessful Her brother Declan provided The Post with that Bannon had provided emotional or financial support to help her recover from drug addiction and depressionSteve is a caring and compassionate man and Diane is blessed to still have him in her life the statement said We appreciate the media respecting my sisters privacy at this early stage of her recovery Neighbors of the Opechee Drive home said they remember Clohesy vividly in part because she had a steady stream of visitors some of them disruptive Four neighbors told The Post that they had a community meeting with police to complain about noise at the house and cars speeding from the premises at late hoursPolice records show that officers went to the Opechee address at least three times over several months in 2014 The officers were responding to reports about disturbances including loud music In one case a woman at the home called police around midnight to express fears about an ex-boyfriend who was shining a bright light into the windows Her name is redacted in the reportBeatriz Portela a real estate agent who represented the Opechee landlords said she also received a call and text messages from neighbors who were anxious about troubling incidents at the house including speeding vehicles and a car crash They were super upset Portela said  On April 2 2014 more than a year after Bannon signed the lease on the residence in Coconut Grove he registered to vote in Florida and listed the Opechee Drive address as his legal home Bannon did not have to show an ID to register He provided the last four digits of his Social Security number to verify his identityOne of the allures of Florida is its zero income tax rate for in-state residents The Post was unable to determine what state Bannon claimed as his primary residence for the purpose of income tax Accountants advise people who work in multiple states to carefully document the number of nights they spend in Florida and maintain records of travel housing even of meals Registering to vote is considered one indication of residency as is a drivers license Under state law new residents must apply for a license within 30 days if they intend to operate a vehicle Phillip Sroka a partner at the accounting firm of Morrison Brown Argiz and Farra in Miami said he advises clients who split their time in multiple states to take care to document their presence in Florida for more than six months That includes airline tickets restaurant receipts and utility billsIn an interview with The Post Sroka said suspicions are raised when individuals have their bills sent outside the states where they claim their residencesIt gets a little sketchy when you accept employment elsewhere he said Where it gets a little on the line and subject to interpretation is where you have a lot of other business dealings elsewhere As 2015 approached Bannon continued his roving life He rented out his Laguna Beach home and in January 2015 bought a townhouse as a second home in Pinehurst NC The deed lists Bannons mailing address at his money managers office in Beverly HillsOn Feb 18 2015 Bannon ended the water and sewer service at Opechee Drive and switched the service to Onaway Drive less than a half mile away in Coconut Grove records show Five days later Bannon changed his voter registration to Onaway DriveThe Opechee house was left in disrepair according to an email between the landlord and Bannon and interviews with the landlordPadlocks had been placed on interior doors  or the doors had been removed altogether A hot tub was destroyed[E]ntire Jacuzzi bathtub seems to have been covered in acid the landlord wrote in the February 2015 email to Bannon Im out of town Bannon replied is there any way u can talk with Diane and sort things out The damage was estimated at more than $14000 according to an accounting by the landlords who kept the $9800 security deposit from Bannon and Clohesy Kammerer their real estate agent said he was troubled by the damageI would not work with them after that he said I would not refer them again as clients of mine Around this time Bannon was becoming a fixture at the Breitbart News townhouse location in Washington nicknamed the Breitbart Embassy hosting parties meeting with journalists and staying overnightIn  a reporter described interviewing Bannon multiple times in January and February at the Breitbart townhouse in WashingtonThe article headlined This Man Is the Most Dangerous Political Operative in America described the building as a 14-room townhouse that [Bannon] occupiesOrdinarily Bannons townhouse is crypt-quiet and feels like a museum as its faithfully decorated down to its embroidered silk curtains and painted murals in authentic Lincoln-era details the article said On Oct 26 2015 SiriusXM announced that Bannons weekend radio show would expand its live broadcasts to weekday mornings from 6 am to 9 am from studios in Washington and New York Donald Trump was a guest on the inaugural show Nov 2Five months later Bannon shut off sewer and water service at the Onaway address in Miami The house remained uninhabited for monthsThree neighbors interviewed by The Post said they were confident Bannon had not lived at the homeI often saw Diane said Joseph JL Plummer a prominent Miami resident who lived next door and was a city commissioner for nearly 30 years I never saw himIn mid-August Bannon became chief executive of the Trump campaign As he was assuming control Bannon changed the address on his Florida voter registration records On Aug 19 he signed an oath that he now lived at the home of a longtime business associate in Nokomis Fla in Sarasota County The questions about Bannons residency emerged Aug 26 when the Guardian wrote that Bannon had been registered to vote at a vacant house  the Onaway address in MiamiThe local NBC station in Miami reported that the state attorneys office had requested Bannons voter records from county election officials At least two people filed complaints about Bannon with the Florida Department of State claiming he had committed voter fraud by asserting he was a resident documents show In October the department said the complaints did not merit an investigation That month Bannon registered to vote in New York from a Manhattan condo overlooking Bryant Park and later cast an absentee ballot in the presidential election Because he was registered in two places he was later removed from Floridas voter rollsUnder Florida law it is a third-degree felony to provide false information on a voter registration application It is punishable by up to five years in prison First-time offenders are rarely given more than probation something that could also lead to the loss of a security clearanceOfficials from the State Attorneys Office for Miami-Dade County which is led by an elected Democrat declined to provide details about their probe into Bannons residency claim In denying a Post request for documents about the investigation officials cited confidentiality rules for active criminal investigative informationSpokesman Ed Griffith said At this point it is not overBut proving wrongdoing in Bannons case could be difficult because state law does not clearly define residency according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymityFacing an upcoming electoral challenge from a populist far-right party Dutch Prime MinisterMark Rutte released an open letter Monday that offered a thinly veiled warning to immigrantsAct normal or go awayRuttes letter was published in a full-page newspaper advertisement and promoted on social media by his party thecenter-right Peoples Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD)In his message the prime minister said he understood there were growing concerns in the Netherlands about those coming into the country who dont integrate People who dont want to adapt [who are] attacking our habits and rejecting our values Rutte wrote who attack gay people who shout at women in short skirts or call ordinary Dutch people racistyou so fundamentally reject our land I prefer that you leave the letter said As it happens I have that feeling too Act normal or go awayRutte repeated his message in a separate interview with the  saying that those who do not agree with Dutch values should leave You have the choice go away the prime minister said You do not need to be hereThe Netherlands ispreparing for nationwide elections to be held on March 15 Rutte who has held the office of prime minister since 2010 is facing a battle for right-wing voters fromGeert Wilders the outspoken anti-immigration politician who leads the Party for Freedom (PVV)Wilders has capitalized on a populist backlash to refugees and migrants in the Netherlands over the past few years and some  have shown support for the PVV nearly equalto VVD ahead of the voteThe populist leader would struggle toform a coalition even if his party won a large amount of votes however Most mainstream parties including the VVD have refused to work with Wilders who was recently convicted of insulting an ethnic group and inciting discrimination after he Ruttes letter didnt mention Wilders by name but it did appear tomildly criticizethe PVVsrhetoric arguing that the solution is not [to] blame a group of people because of one persons actions Among observers however the prime ministers message was widely interpreted as an attempt to appeal to Wilderss supporters ahead of an increasingly competitive electionCas Mudde a Dutch political scientist at the University of Georgia who studies the European populist radical right said Rutte was trying to show right-wing voters that he could be as tough on immigration and law and order as the PVV It is thinly veiled nativism completely ignoring the anti-refugees violence physical and verbal by natives that the country has experienced in the past years MuddesaidWilders responded to Ruttes letter with a flurry of tweets Monday accusing the prime minister of stealing his positions Wilders also suggested that Ruttewas being hypocritical as he wasthe man of open borders the asylum tsunami mass immigration Islamization lies and deceptionMark Rutte de man van de open grenzen de asieltsunami de massaimmigratie de islamisering de leugens en het bedrog  Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv)AMSTERDAM  When Dutch voters go to the polls Wednesday far-right leader Geert Wilders is hoping they will deliver the West its third major populist jolt in less than a year  and the first since Donald Trump won the US presidency in NovemberBut there are growing indications that Trump may be more hindrance than help to Wilderss campaignAfter leading  for nearly all of last year and seeming to be in commanding position as 2017 got underway Wilderss Freedom Party has fallen sharply in the past two months  a period that coincides with the tumultuous dawn of the Trump presidencyIn surveys conducted in recent days the Freedom Party has even fallen out of first place slipping just behind the center-right party of Prime Minister Mark RutteIn the hyper-fragmented world of Dutch politics  there will be 28 parties on the ballot Wednesday  analysts emphasize that the campaign remains fluid and Wilders could still wind up on top Wilderss own backers say they believe fervently that the polls are underestimating his support just as they did with Trump in the United StatesBut increasingly his competitors are using unfavorable comparisons to the US president to attack Wilders and to try to halt the populist wave that began with Britains vote last June to exit the European UnionThis is our chance to stop this trend Rutte said in a brief interview as he recently campaigned at an Amsterdam shopping mall Theres still a big risk that [Wilders] will be the biggest party But weve seen the chaos after Brexit and after the elections in America And we cant have that hereTrump is deeply unpopular in the Netherlands as he is across Western Europe And although Wilderss hardcore supporters are unlikely to be deterred by the comparisons to Trump they may be effective among those who want to shake up the system  but not quite in the  Trump has during his first weeks in officeTrump is the biggest antidote to Wilders said Geert Tomlow a former Freedom Party candidate who still agrees with much of the partys agenda People are aware that a Wilders type of person wont give them the change theyre looking forThe drop in the polls for Wilders is just the latest evidence that a Trump backlash in Europe may be helping the political establishment fight back against the spread of nationalistic far-right movements across the continentIn Germany  where parliamentary elections are due in September  the long-beleaguered center-left Social Democrats saw a pronounced poll bump after leader Martin Schulz  against Trump In France  with a presidential vote just around the corner this spring  centrist Emmanuel Macron has been gaining on the far-rights Marine Le Pen in measures of first-round supportTrump and Wilders have much in common Both delight in bashing the political establishment and seek to mobilize voters with nativist anti-immigrant appeals Both also relish doling out bombast in 140-character bitesWilders took a cue from the US elections as to how Donald Trump has done this The whole point is to denounce people the media the establishment said Sijbrende Jong an analyst at The Hague Center for Strategic Studies Its politics on the basis of emotion Its completely devoid of contentEarly in the campaign Rutte seemed intent on stealing some of Wilderss emotional thunder by mimicking his message In an open letter Rutte called on people in the Netherlands to The letter appeared aimed at immigrants who fail to integrate referring to people who are attacking our habits and rejecting our values who attack gay people who shout at women in short skirts or call ordinary Dutch people racistBut in the recent interview Rutte said the letter was targeted more broadly at anyone who fails to act normal including those who take extreme positions that demonize immigrants and refugeesJoost Sneller a candidate for the centrist D66 party said it was up to Wilderss opponents not to try to co-opt his message  but to convince voters that theres a better wayAs a small country he said the Netherlands has only succeeded when its engaged with the world with commerce art and ideasIts open society versus closed society he said Weve been strong by being openThat message Sneller said is getting out His party has been gaining in the polls as Wilders and his allies decline and has edged into a virtual tie for third placeWhat we hear on the doorstep is We cant have Trump-like things happen here Sneller said Its time to stand upHouse Republican leaders plan to propose preserving the top income-tax rate for very wealthy people a last-minute adjustment to their plan to overhaul the tax code that they hope will assuage concerns that it will mainly benefit the rich according to four people briefed on the planning TuesdayGOP leaders had planned to collapse the seven existing income tax brackets into three brackets lowering the top rate from 396percent to 35percent but now will retain the top bracket for people earning more than a certain threshold perhaps $1000000 the people saidThe detail was one of several that emerged Tuesday as GOP leaders scrambled to put the final touches on their plan widely seen as the last best chance for Trump and congressional Republicans to advance a major policy achievement this year Drafters planned to

meeting of his panel Tuesday night Brady issued a statement saying In consultation with President Trump and our leadership team we have decided to release the bill text on Thursday He said they remain on schedule to take action and approve a bill next week The delay raises questions about whether Republicans have resolved all of their differences amid concerns that even a few defections could prevent the bill from passingThe bill will aim to slash corporate tax rates simplify taxes for individuals and families and lure the foreign operations of multinational firms back to the United States with incentives and penaltiesThe decision to preserve a top rate signals that Republicans are eager to avoid the impression that their plan which has already come under attack as doing little to boost the middle class seeks only to reward wealthy Americans and corporations And the move could attract the support of more moderate RepublicansThe House and Senate plan to work on separate tracks to pass legislation by Thanksgiving and send a bill to President Trump for his signature by years end though many expect it will take longer than that if the effort succeeds at allIt will be the biggest tax event in the history of our country Trump promised on Tuesday during a meeting with business trade groups at the White House a claim he has made repeatedly Later in a tweet he said the Republican House members are working hard (and late) toward the Massive Tax Cuts that they know you deserveIn a sign that House Republicans are willing to go only so far to mollify concerns about inequality they plan to move ahead with a proposal to eliminate the estate tax though it would be phased out over a number of years They also will propose changes to tax-protected retirement savings plans such as 401(k)s in an effort to raise revenue But Brady said Tuesday those changes remained in flux and that 401(k)s might ultimately be left aloneOverall House Republicans say their plan will reduce federal tax revenue by $15trillion over the next decade Keeping the tax rate for people earning over $1million could reduce the impact on the deficit by about $200billion over a decade according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal BudgetHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif) said Tuesday that Bradys tax plan would lower the corporate tax rate from 35percent to 20percent as demanded by Trump A new wrinkle was emerging late Tuesday however with concern growing that the corporate tax reduction might not be able to be made permanent if it proves too costlyBusiness leaders will fight hard to prevent Republicans from allowing the rate to go back up after several years but the GOP could be hamstrung because it cannot push into law a tax change that adds too much to the deficitNumerous details of the tax proposal came during a briefing that House Speaker Paul D Ryan (R-Wis) had Tuesday afternoon with conservative activists Grover Norquist president of Americans for Tax Reform is one of the people who confirmed the 396percent rate would remain for the highest incomeOverall Im very happy with the bill said Adam Brandon who is chief executive of FreedomWorks and attended the Ryan briefing My read is that everyone is going to be seeing a tax cutCurrently families pay the 396percent rate on income above $470700 so the proposal would still lower taxes for people who earn above the lower amountThe implications of the changes envisioned by GOP leaders could be far-reaching but numerous aspects remain uncertainThousands of companies that pay their taxes through the individual income-tax code would see their rates lowered on top income from 396percent to 25percent Its unclear whether there would be new provisions to prevent more-wealthy individuals from creating companies to pay the 25percent rate on their income rather than the higher rateThe new proposal is expected to include a new minimum tax that US companies will be required to pay on certain foreign earnings as a way to prevent them from moving US operations to low-tax countries Businesses are watching carefully how the House bill deals with US companies that produce goods overseas and then sell them back into the United StatesThe House GOP plan would also allow companies to immediately expense capital investments such as new equipment for five years but cut back the ability to deduct interest paymentsMany businesses and the wealthy are expected to be the biggest beneficiaries according to initial versions of the plan while the impact on many in the middle class is disputed and less clearThe proposal would roughly double the standard deduction that many Americans can claim to exempt a portion of their income from taxation but it would also eliminate the personal exemption which tends to benefit families with multiple children But the tax plan is expected to expand the child tax credit something Ivanka Trump has said will help working familiesThe House GOP plan would allow Americans to deduct the property taxes they pay from their income but prohibit for the first time Americans from deducting the state and local income taxes they pay from their federal taxable income a simmering issue that threatens to rip apart the GOP coalition needed to approve the billThe plan would also abolish the alternative minimum tax a system set up to ensure people do not claim so many deductions that they pay too little in taxes McCarthy saidThe economic success of the package hinges on controversial economic theories that assume large tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy will lead to economic growth and wage gains for everyone else a conclusion that economists and policymakers have debated for decadesBut Republicans have a rare lock of political power controlling the White House House and Senate and are desperate to regain political footing lost after a number of missteps this year particularly the failure to rewrite health-care policyThe speed with which they are doing this is more about politics than it is about policy said Rep Richard E Neal (Mass) the ranking Democrat on Bradys committee They dont want people to see whats in it and I think they need a victoryThe tax package is expected to reduce revenue by more than $4trillion over 10 years Republicans hope to recoup some of that lost revenue by eliminating a number of tax breaks but they have been careful not to identify all of these changes in part because they expect a revolt from interest groups that would be affectedTheyve got $4trillion worth of tax promises and they basically at this point have got virtually no revenue in order to pay for it Sen Ron Wyden (D-Ore) said Tuesday So what they have done is basically made it clear that their promises to the middle class are really not worth the paper they are written on They are false promises to the middle classWhite House officials and GOP congressional leaders have met for months to try to establish the framework for rewriting the tax code but they agreed only on broad parameters Big tests now loom for Brady and his Senate counterpart Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G Hatch (R-Utah) to craft legislation that can pass both chambersThe government collects roughly $4trillion a year in taxes and other revenue a threshold that still falls short of how much money it spendsTrump says the changes could lead to an immediate jolt in economic growth saying on Tuesday that it could lead companies to bring more than $4trillion in past foreign earnings back to the United States He also said it would lead to a flood of companies moving back to the country lured by big tax cuts and the threat that their foreign earnings will be subject to stricter taxation for the first timeIt is details such as those though that will be the focus of several intense weeks of negotiations in the House and Senate GOP tax writers are also expected to have a much different approach to the taxation of profits overseasResolving these differences will be crucial because Republicans have signaled they will try to push the tax cuts into law without any support from Democrats testing the slim margin they control in the Senate and their balky caucus in the HouseGiven that they are trying to do this with a one-party approach they dont have a lot of flexibility said Alan Auerbach director of the Burch Center for Tax Policy and Public Finance at the University of California at Berkeley Heather Long contributed to this reportPolicy consultant Maya Rockeymoore Cummings one of two women vying to unseat

programs if a bill approved by a US House committee this week becomes lawIn general employersdont have that power under existing federal laws which protect genetic privacy and nondiscrimination But a bill passed Wednesday by theHouse Committee on Education and the Workforce would allow employers to get around thoseobstacles if the information is collected as part of a workplace wellness programSuchprograms  which offer workers a variety ofcarrots and sticksto monitor and improve their health such as lowering cholesterol  have become increasingly popularwith companiesSome offer discounts on health insurance to employees who complete health-risk assessments Others might charge people more for smokingUnder the Affordable Care Act employers are allowed to discount health insurance premiums by up to 30 percent  and in some cases 50 percent  for employees who voluntarily participate in a wellness program where theyre required to meet certain health targets  The bill is under review by other House committees and still must be considered by the Senate But it has already faced strong criticism from a broad array of groups as well as House Democrats In a letter sent to the committee earlier this week  representing consumer health and medical advocacy groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics AARP March of Dimes and the National Womens Law Center said the legislation if enacted would undermine basic privacy provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act and the 2008 Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act()Congress passed GINA to prohibit discrimination by health insurers and employers based on the information that people carry in their genes There is an exception that allows for employees to provide that information as part of voluntary wellness programs But the law states that employee participation must be entirely voluntary with no incentives for providing the dataor penalties for not providing itBut theHouse legislation would allow employers to impose penalties of up to 30 percent of the total cost of the employees health insurance on those who choose to keep such information private  Its a terrible Hobsons choice between affordable health insurance and protecting ones genetic privacy said Derek Scholes director of science policy at the American Society of Human Genetics which represents human genetics specialists The organization sent aopposing the billThe average annual premium for employer-sponsored family health coverage in 2016 was $18142 according to the Kaiser Family Foundation Under the plan proposed in the bill a wellness program could charge employees an extra $5443 in annual premiums if they choose not to share their genetic and health informationThe bill  HR 1313 was introduced by Rep Virginia Foxx (R-NC) who chairs the Committee on Education and the Workforce A committee  said the bill provides employers the legal certainty they need to offer employee wellness plans helping to promote a healthy workforce and lower health care costs It passed on a party-line vote with all 22 Republicans supporting it and all 17 Democrats opposedThe bills supporters in the business community have argued that competing regulations in federal laws make it too difficult for companies to offer these wellness programs In congressional this month the American Benefits Council which represents major employers said the burdensome rules jeopardize wellness programs that improve employee health can increase productivity and reduce health care spendingA House committee spokeswoman told CNBC that those are spreading false informationin a desperate attempt to deny employees the choice to participate in a voluntary program that can reduce health insurance costs and encourage healthy lifestyle choicessNorth Korean state media are known for hyperbole but even so the official announcement of the execution of Jang Song Thaek is a step beyond The state-run Korean Central News Agency released a long article detailing the alleged crimes and transgressions of Jang a longtime senior regime official who was also the uncle of leader Kim Jong UnIt really must be read to be believed A typical line asserts for example that Jang behaved so arrogantly and insolently as unwillingly standing up from his seat and half-heartedly clapping touching off towering resentment of our service personnel and people Here is how the release startsPYONGYANG December 13 0623 KST (KCNA)  Upon hearing the report on the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers Party of Korea the service personnel and people throughout the country broke into angry shouts that a stern judgment of the revolution should be meted out to the anti-party counter-revolutionary factional elements Against the backdrop of these shouts rocking the country a special military tribunal of the DPRK Ministry of State Security was held on December 12 against traitor for all ages Jang Song ThaekThe accused Jang brought together undesirable forces and formed a faction as the boss of a modern day factional group for a long time and thus committed such hideous crime as attempting to overthrow the state by all sorts of intrigues and despicable methods with a wild ambition to grab the supreme power of our party and stateThough North Korea has had many political purges the highly public nature of this one has been unprecedented since Pyongyang first revealed it on Dec 8 when state TV showed uniformed troops escorting Jang out of a Politburo meeting The over-the-top language of this release although awfully easy for outsiders to laugh at is an important component of the purge -- and a potentially significant hint of whats happening there and why Well have a fuller look at Jangs purge shortly so do check backThe full KCNA release is preserved here (state media has ) The rest of the release followsThe tribunal examined Jangs crimesAll the crimes committed by the accused were proved in the course of hearing and were admitted by himA decision of the special military tribunal of the Ministry of State Security of the DPRK was read out at the trialEvery sentence of the decision served as sledge-hammer blow brought down by our angry service personnel and people on the head of Jang an anti-party counter-revolutionary factional element and despicable political careerist and tricksterThe accused is a traitor to the nation for all ages who perpetrated anti-party counter-revolutionary factional acts in a bid to overthrow the leadership of our party and state and the socialist systemJang was appointed to responsible posts of the party and state thanks to the deep political trust of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il and received benevolence from them more than any others from long agoHe held higher posts than before and received deeper trust from supreme leader Kim Jong Un in particularThe political trust and benevolence shown by the peerlessly great men of Mt Paektu were something he hardly deservedIt is an elementary obligation of a human being to repay trust with sense of obligation and benevolence with loyaltyHowever despicable human scum Jang who was worse than a dog perpetrated thrice-cursed acts of treachery in betrayal of such profound trust and warmest paternal love shown by the party and the leader for himFrom long ago Jang had a dirty political ambition He dared not raise his head when Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il were alive But reading their faces Jang had an axe to grind and involved himself in double-dealing He began revealing his true colors thinking that it was just the time for him to realize his wild ambition in the period of historic turn when the generation of the revolution was replacedJang committed such an unpardonable thrice-cursed treason as overtly and covertly standing in the way of settling the issue of succession to the leadership with an axe to grind when a very important issue was under discussion to hold respected Kim Jong Un in high esteem as the only successor to Kim Jong Il in reflection of the unanimous desire and will of the entire party and army and all peopleWhen his cunning move proved futile and the decision that Kim Jong Un was elected vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Workers Party of Korea at the Third Conference of the WPK in reflection of the unanimous will of all party members service personnel and people was proclaimed making all participants break into enthusiastic cheers that shook the conference hall he behaved so arrogantly and insolently as unwillingly standing up from his seat and half-heartedly clapping touching off towering resentment of our service personnel and peopleJang confessed that he behaved so at that time as a knee-jerk reaction as he thought that if Kim Jong Uns base and system for leading the army were consolidated this would lay a stumbling block in the way of grabbing the power of the party and stateWhen Kim Jong Il passed away so suddenly and untimely to our sorrow he began working in real earnest to realize its long-cherished greed for powerAbusing the honor of often accompanying Kim Jong Un during his field guidance Jang tried hard to create illusion about him by projecting himself internally and externally as a special being on a par with the headquarters of the revolutionIn a bid to rally a group of reactionaries to be used by him for toppling the leadership of the party and state he let the undesirable and alien elements including those who had been dismissed and relieved of their posts after being severely punished for disobeying the instructions of Kim Jong Il and kowtowing to him work in a department of the Central Committee of the WPK and organs under it in a crafty mannerJang did serious harm to the youth movement in our country being part of the group of renegades and traitors in the field of youth work bribed by enemies Even after they were disclosed and purged by the resolute measure of the party he patronized those cats paws and let them hold important posts of the party and stateThere are so many twists and turns in the story involving President Trump and his team and Russian meddling in the 2016 US elections As a public service The Fact Checker is keeping track of the various tentacles of this complex saga and highlighting any inconsistencies or falsehoods we can findReviewing our fact checks so far its clear that in many cases the White Houses rhetoric shifted as The Washington Post or the New York Times uncovered new information and revealed that officials were being misleading or obfuscating the truth with their rhetoric Since January 2017 we compiled numerous timelines just to keep track of what Trump and his aides said when they said it what the public knew at the time of their statements and how they shifted over time We also fact-checked misleading attacks by Democrats about actions by Trump administration officialsThe special counsels investigation is underway so this story keeps evolving Each fact check and this roundup will be updated as new information becomes availableHeres a chronological compilation of 14 Trump-Russia fact checks since January 2017 We linked to video fact checks where available Click on the headline to read each columnOn Jan 6 2017 US intelligence agencies published a high-confidence assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a cyberattack during the 2016 presidential election with the aim of undermining faith in the US democratic process and hurting Hillary Clintons electability We decoded then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebuss spin misleading the public in an effort to play down the findings in the assessmentOn Feb 13 2017 then-national security adviser Michael Flynn was fired White House officials knew for weeks that Flynn had misled about the nature of his December 2016 calls with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak but he was only pressured to resign after The Post uncovered it Flynns statements to The Post shifted from an outright denial to a less equivocal one as The Post uncovered more information We compiled a timeline of events dating to December 2016 that led to Flynns firingOn March 1  that Attorney General Jeff Sessions in 2016 had met twice with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak but did not disclose them in his Senate confirmation hearing In a swipe at Sessions Sen Claire McCaskill (D-Mo) tweeted that she had no calls or meetings with the Russian ambassador over her 10 years on the Senate Armed Services Committee But we easily found earlier tweets from 2013 and 2015 that showed she did indeed have such interactions with the Russian ambassador in the past McCaskill received Three PinocchiosHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) rebuked Sessions for not disclosing his contacts with Kislyak and claimed Congress impeached President Bill Clinton for something far less than what Sessions had done But that description was a stretch While the Sessions and Clinton cases both involve statements made under oath the circumstances were vastly different (Later Sessions would recuse himself from the Trump-Russia investigation due to his campaign contacts with Kislyak) Pelosi earned Two PinocchiosOn May 8 former acting attorney general Sally Yates testified that she had informed White House Counsel on Jan 26 that Flynn lied about the nature of his calls with Kislyak Yet it took 18 days  and The Posts reporting  for Trump to act In response to Yatess testimony Trump blamed former president Barack Obama for giving Flynn a security clearance in the first place and elevating Flynn But this was just a distraction with little factual basis Trump received Three PinocchiosOn May 9 2017 Trump fired James B Comey as FBI director As a justification Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions pointed to Comeys handling of the agencys investigation into Hillary Clintons private email server But during the 2016 presidential campaigns neither Trump nor Sessions was outwardly critical of Comeys decisions  at least in the same way they were in May 2017 In this column we explored inconsistencies in both mens rhetoric over Comeys handling of the Clinton investigationOver the three days after Comeys firing the exact reason for his dismissal remained elusive In this column we outlined all the contradictory explanations from Trump and his White House At first Trump said he was merely acting on a Justice Department recommendation Several explanations later Trump ultimately revealedthat he had planned on firing Comey all along because Trump did not want Comey overseeing the FBI investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 electionOn May 15 The Post reported that Trump revealed highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in a White House meeting and that Trumps disclosures jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State In response national security adviser HR McMaster made comments that obscured the fact that he essentially confirmed the key factual elements of The Post article In this column we translated McMasters rhetoricBy the end of May it was clear that the story of Flynn merged with the firing of Comey So we compiled a new timeline of events incorporating both story lines showing the complicated relationship between Trump and ComeyOn June 8 Comey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee and offered his version of events for the first time The testimony revealed several contradictory statements made by Trump and Comey about the same meetings and discussions We also compiled a Fact Checker video timeline of the he-said he-said storyNo matter what new development is revealed in the Trump-Russia story one thing has remained consistent Trump blames the Democrats not the Russians Trump calls it a hoax witch hunt and fake news  despite findings by the US intelligence community and even after the White House confirmed reports of his teams interactions with RussiansAfter Comey was fired former FBI director Robert S Mueller III was appointed special counsel to oversee the Russia investigation and related matters As Mueller assembled his team of investigators Trump and his surrogates began attacking donations made by some of Muellers attorneys They questioned Muellers independence as some members of his team previously donated to Hillary Clinton Barack Obama or the Democratic Party But this is a baseless attack legally and under federal ethics rules such donations pose no conflict of interest Trump earned Three PinocchiosIn June Mueller widened the scope of his investigation including whether Trump obstructed justice when firing Comey As a result with every new development Trumps critics are quick to call for his impeachment and label his actions as obstruction of justice But its not so simple and the complexities of the process get muddled with heated rhetoric In this column we answered some key questions about obstruction of justice impeachment and executive privilegeOn July 8 2017 the New York Times revealed that Donald Trump Jr met with a Russian attorney with ties to the Kremlin during the 2016 campaign In following days Trump Jr provided contradictory and misleading statements that shifted as the Times uncovered new information about the meeting While Trump Jr previously claimed that he never set up a meeting with a Russian national for campaign purposes that turned out to be falseIn response to questions about the Trump campaigns contacts with Russia the White House began deflecting to efforts by a Ukrainian American operative to expose former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manaforts ties to the Russian government The White House now claims that the real story of coordination is between the Clinton campaign and Ukraine But this is a facile comparison with key differences between the situations that make them fundamentally different We left the claim unrated for now because we do not know the full set of facts in either the Trump-Russia or Clinton-Ukraine storiesWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders asserted that Fusion GPS a research firm run by ex-journalists took money from the Russian government while it arranged for the creation of a dossier about Trumps ties to RussiaBut she is mixing up two unrelated clients of the firm There were Russian entities involved but there is currently no evidence that the Russian government paid for Fusions work on the defense of a Russian bank accused of fraud at the same time Fusion investigated Trumps business dealings in Russia Huckabee earned Three Pinocchios for spin that fell flat()FBI agents raided the home in Alexandria Va of President Trumps former campaign chairman arriving in the pre-dawn hours late last month andseizing documents and other materials related to the special counsel investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 electionThe raid which occurred without warning on July26 signaled an aggressive new approach by special counsel Robert S Mueller III and his team in dealing with a key figure in the Russia inquiry Manafort has been under increasing pressure as the Mueller team looked into his personal finances and his professional career as a highly paid foreign political consultantUsing a search warrant agents appeared the day Manafort was scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and a day after he met voluntarily with Senate Intelligence Committee staff membersThe search warrant requested documents related to tax banking and other matters People familiar with the search said agents departed the Manafort residence with a trove of material including binders prepared ahead of Manaforts congressional testimonyInvestigators in the Russia inquiry have previously sought documents with subpoenas which are less intrusive and confrontational than a search warrant With a warrant agents can inspect a physical location and seize any useful information To get a judge to sign off on a search warrant prosecutors must show that there is probable cause that a crime has been committed I think it adds a shock and awe enforcement component to what until now has followed a natural path for a white-collar investigation said Jacob Frenkel a former federal prosecutor More so than anything else weve seen so far it really does send a powerful law enforcement message when the search warrant is used  That message is that the special counsel team will use all criminal investigative tools available to advance the investigation as quickly and as comprehensively as possibleJason Maloni a spokesman for Manafort confirmed that agents executed a warrant at one of the political consultants homes and that Manafort cooperated with the searchManafort has been voluntarily providing documents to congressional committees investigating Russias election interference The search warrant indicates that investigators may have argued to a federal judge that they had reason to think Manafort could not be trusted to turn over all records in response to a grand jury subpoenaThe raid also could have been intended to send a message to Trumps former campaign chairman that he should not expect gentle treatment or legal courtesies from Muellers team members who already have begun combing through Manaforts complicated financial past  The documents seizedin the raid include materials Manafort already had provided to Congress said people familiar with the search and the significance of what was obtained remained unclear Wednesday eveningIf the FBI wanted the documents they could just ask [Manafort] and he would have turned them over said one adviser close to the White HouseJosh Stueve spokesman for Mueller declined to comment as did Reginald Brown an attorney for Manafort Mr Manafort has consistently cooperated with law enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well said Maloni the Manafort spokesmanSen Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn) a member of the Judiciary Committee and a former US attorney called the search a significant and even stunning development noting that such raids are generally reserved for the most serious criminal investigations dealing with uncooperative or untrusted potential targetsA federal judge signing this warrant would demand persuasive evidence of probable cause that a serious crime has been committed and that less intrusive and dramatic investigative means would be ineffective he said in a statement Mueller has increased legal pressure on Manafort consolidating under his authority unrelated investigations of various aspects of Manaforts professional and personal lifeManaforts allies fear that Mueller hopes to build a case against Manafort unrelated to the 2016 campaign in hopes that he would provide information against others in Trumps inner circle in exchange for lessening his legal exposureManafort has provided more than 300 pages ofdocuments to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate and House intelligence committees The information includes notes Manafort took while attending a meeting with Donald Trump Jr and a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in June 2016   Emails show that Trump Jr accepted the meeting and invited Manafort after he was told that the Russian lawyer would provide damaging information about Democrat Hillary Clinton as part of a Russian government effort to assist his fathers campaignThe special counsels office has subpoenaed records and testimony related to the Trump Tower meeting people familiar with the investigation saidLast week the Trump campaign turned over more than 20000 pages of documents to congressional investigators examining Russian efforts to influence the election Manafort and Trump Jr separately turned over hundreds of documents requested by congressional committeesManafort had been subpoenaed to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 26 the day of the raid Ultimately however the subpoena was withdrawn and he did not testify Thecommittee chairman Sen Charles E Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen Dianne Feinstein (Calif) the panels ranking Democrat said in a joint statement that they had dropped the demand after Manafort began producing documents Manafort an experienced political operative who was oncea business partner of Trump confidant Roger Stonewas hired to professionalize the Trump campaign at the recommendationof another Trump friend Tom Barrack an international real estate investorAs a political consultant Manafort traveled the world at times offering advice to despots and dictatorsHis decade of work in Ukraine on behalf of a Russia-friendly political party has drawn attention from the FBI In Kiev he advised the Party of Regions helping to elect former president Viktor Yanukovych who was ousted from power amid public protests in 2014 and fled to RussiaA few days after attending the Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 at the urging of Trump Jr Manafort was named chairman of Trumps campaign following the ouster of campaign manager Corey Lewandowski Manafort remained in that role through the Republican National Convention and into August when he resigned amid growing scrutiny of his work in Ukraine The New York Times reported at the time that his name was found in a ledger of off-the-books cash payments made by the Party of Regions Manafort has denied receiving any improper payments from the partyStill the work was lucrative In June Manafort filed Foreign Agents Registration Act paperwork with the Justice Department providing new details about his work in Ukraine The documents showed that his firm was paid $171million for its work in Ukraine over two years before expensesManaforts retroactive filing about his Ukraine work came as investigators scrutinized his foreign lobbying and began to aggressively probe his financial pastDuring the spring prosecutors issued subpoenas seeking information about his income sources and financial transactions One subpoena reviewed by The Washington Post sought information concerning contracts for work  communication or other records of correspondence related to about two dozen people and businesses that appeared to be connected to Manafort or his wife including some who worked for Manafort while he was a political consultant in UkraineThe subpoena was issued by a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia where Manaforts consulting business has been located Also named in the subpoena were various corporations formed in Cyprus Manafort appeared to have routed money he earned in Ukraine and in business dealings with a Russian business magnate through Cyprus-based bank accountsAfter Mueller was appointed his team took over the Manafort investigation that was underway in VirginiaState authorities in New York also have issued subpoenas seeking information about Manaforts real estate loansAnd Muellers office has taken over an investigation of financial dealings that involved Manafort and his son-in-law a real estate investor including real estate transactions in California Philip Rucker Matt Zapotosky and Julie Tate contributed to this reportThe FBI obtained a secret court order last summer to monitor the communications of an adviser to presidential candidate Donald Trump part of an investigation into possible links between Russia and the campaign law enforcement and other US officials said The FBI and the Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Pages communications after convincing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power in this case Russia according to the officials This is the clearest evidence so far that the FBI had reason to believe during the 2016 presidential campaign that a Trump campaign adviser was in touch with Russian agents Such contacts are now at the center of an investigation into whether the campaign coordinated with the Russian government to swing the election Page has not been accused of any crimes and it is unclear whether the Justice Department might later seek charges against him or others in connection with Russias meddling in the 2016 presidential electioninvestigations dont result in criminal chargesThe officials spoke about the court order on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of a counterintelligence probeDuring an interview with the Washington Post editorial page staff in March 2016  who had previously been an investment banker in Moscow as a foreign policy adviser to his campaign Campaign spokeswoman  Pages role as informalPage has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in his dealings with the Trump campaign or Russia This confirms all of my suspicions about unjustified politically motivated government surveillance Page said in an interview Tuesday I have nothing to hide He compared surveillance of him to the eavesdropping that the FBI and Justice Department conducted against civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr  The White House FBI and Justice Department declined to commentFBI Director James B Comey disclosed in public testimony to the House Intelligence Committee last month that the bureau is investigating efforts by the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 presidential election Comey said this includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russias effortsComey declined to comment during the hearing about any individuals including Page who worked in Moscow for Merrill Lynch a decade ago and who has said he invested in Russian energy giant Gazprom In a letter to Comey in September Page had said he had sold his Gazprom investmentDuring the hearing last month Democratic lawmakers repeatedly singled out Pages contacts in Russia as a cause for concern The judges who rule on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requests oversee the nations most sensitive national security cases and their warrants are some of the most closely guarded secrets in the world of US law enforcement and intelligence gathering Any FISA application has to be approved at the highest levels of the Justice Department and the FBIApplications for FISA warrants Comey said are often thicker than his wrists and that thickness represents all the work Justice Department attorneys and FBI agents have to do to convince a judge that such surveillance is appropriate in an investigation The governments application for the surveillance order targeting Page included a lengthy declaration that laid out investigators basis for believing that Page was an agent of the Russian government and knowingly engaged in clandestine intelligence activities on behalf of Moscow officials said Among other things the application cited contacts that he had with a Russian intelligence operative in New York City in 2013 officials said Those contacts had earlier surfaced in a federal espionage case brought by the Justice Department against the intelligence operative and two other Russian agents In addition the application said Page had other contacts with Russian operatives that have not been publicly disclosed officials said   An application for electronic surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act need not show evidence of a crime But the information obtained through the intercepts can be used to open a criminal investigation and may be used in a prosecutionThe application also showed that the FBI and the Justice Departments national security division have been seeking since July to determine how broad a network of accomplices Russia enlisted in attempting to influence the 2016 presidential election the officials saidSince the 90-day warrant was first issued it has been renewed more than once by the FISA court the officials said In February Page told PBS NewsHour that he was a junior member of the [Trump] campaigns foreign policy advisory groupA former Trump campaign adviser said Page submitted policy memos to the campaign and several times asked to be given a meeting with Trump though his request was never granted He was one of the more active ones in terms of being in touch the adviser saidThe campaign adviser said Page participated in three dinners held for the campaigns volunteer foreign policy advisers in the spring and summer of 2016 coming from New York to Washington to meet with the group Although Trump did not attend Sen Jeff Sessions (R-Ala) a top Trump confidant who became his attorney general attended one meeting of the group with Page in late summer the campaign adviser said Pages role as an adviser to the Trump campaign drew alarm last year from more-established foreign policy experts in part because of Pages effusive praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his criticism of US sanctions over Moscows military intervention in Ukraine In July Page traveled to Moscow where he delivered a speech harshly critical of the United States policy toward Russia While there Page allegedly met with Igor Sechin a Putin confidant and chief executive of the energy company Rosneft according to a dossier compiled by a former British intelligence officer and cited at a congressional hearing by Rep Adam B Schiff (Calif) the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee Officials said some of the information in the dossier has been verified by US intelligence agencies and some of it hasnt while other parts are unlikely to ever be proved or disprovedOn Tuesday Page dismissed what he called the dodgy dossier of false allegationsPage has denied such a meeting occurred saying he has never met Sechin in his life and that he wants to testify before Congress to clear his name A spokesman for Rosneft told Politico in September that the notion that Page met with Sechin was absurd Page said in September that he briefly met Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich during that trip Comey has declined to discuss the details of the Russia probe but in an appearance last month he cited the process for getting FISA warrants as proof that the governments surveillance powers are very carefully used with significant oversightIt is a pain in the neck to get permission to conduct electronic surveillance in the United States And thats good he told an audience at the University of Texas in Austin Officials have said the FBI and the Justice Department were particularly reluctant to seek FISA warrants of campaign figures during the 2016 presidential race because of concerns that agents would inadvertently eavesdrop on political talk To obtain a FISA warrant prosecutors must show that a significant purpose of the warrant is to obtain foreign intelligence information  Page is the only American to have had his communications directly targeted with a FISA warrant in 2016 as part of the Russia probe officials said The FBI routinely obtains FISA warrants to monitor the communications of foreign diplomats in the United States including the Russian ambassador  The conversations between Kislyak and Michael Flynn who became Trumps first national security adviser were recorded in December In February The Washington Post reported that Flynn misled Vice President-elect Mike Pence and others about his discussions with Kislyak prompting Trumps decision to fire himIn March Trump made unsubstantiated claims about US surveillance of Trump Tower in New York Later that month Rep Devin Nunes (R-Calif) chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a Trump transition official charged that details about people associated with the incoming administration details with little apparent foreign intelligence value were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting He said none of the surveillance was related to Russia The FISA order on Page is unrelated to either chargeLast month the former director of national intelligence James R Clapper Jr told NBCs Meet the Press that US law enforcement agencies did not have any FISA orders to monitor the communications of Trump either as a candidate or as a president-elect or his campaign But Clapper did not address whether there were any FISA warrants targeting Trump associates Three years before Page became an adviser to the Trump campaign he came to the attention of FBI counterintelligence agents who learned that Russian spy suspects had sought to use Page as a source for information In that case one of the Russian suspects Victor Podobnyy  who was posing as a diplomat and was later charged by federal prosecutors with acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government  was captured on tape in 2013 discussing an effort to get information and documents from Page That discussion was detailed in a federal complaint filed against Podobnyy and two others The court documents in that spy case only identify Page as Male 1 Officials familiar with the case said that Male 1 is PageIn one secretly recorded conversation detailed in the complaint Podobnyy said Page wrote that he is sorry he went to Moscow and forgot to check his inbox but he wants to meet when he gets back I think he is an idiot and forgot who I am Plus he writes to me in Russian [to] practice the language He flies to Moscow more often than I do He got hooked on Gazprom thinking that if they have a project he could rise up Maybe he can I dont know but its obvious that he wants to earn lots of moneyThe same court document says that in June 2013 Page told FBI agents that he met Podobnyy at an energy symposium in New York where they exchanged contact information In subsequent meetings Page shared with the Russian his outlook on the state of the energy industry as well as documents about the energy business according to the court papersIn the secret tape Podobnyy said he liked the mans enthusiasm but planned to use him to get information and give him little in return You promise a favor for a favor You get the documents from him and tell him to go f--- himself Podobnyy said on the tape according to court papersPage has said the information he provided to the Russians in 2013 was innocuous describing it as basic immaterial information and publicly available research documents He said he had assisted the prosecutors in their case against Evgeny Buryakov who pleaded guilty to conspiring to act in the United States as an unregistered agent of Russian intelligence Rosalind S Helderman contributed to this reportThe former British spy who authored a controversial dossier on behalf of Donald Trumps political opponents alleging ties between Trump and Russia reached an agreement with the FBI a few weeks before the election for the bureau to pay him to continue his work according to several people familiar with the arrangementThe agreement to compensate former MI6 agent Christopher Steele came as US intelligence agencies reached a consensus that the Russians had interfered in the presidential election by orchestrating hacks of Democratic Party email accountsWhile Trump has derided the dossier as fake news compiled by his political opponents the FBIs arrangement with Steele shows that the bureau considered him credible and found his information while unproved to be worthy of further investigationUltimately the FBI did not pay Steele Communications between the bureau and the former spy were interrupted as Steeles now-famous dossier became the subject of news stories congressional inquiries and presidential denials according to the people familiar with the arrangement who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matterAt the time of the October agreement FBI officials probing Russian activities including possible contacts between Trump associates and Russian entities were aware of the information that Steele had been gathering while working for a Washington research firm hired by supporters of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton according to the people familiar with the agreement The firm was due to stop paying Steele as Election Day approached but Steele felt his work was not done these people said    Steele was familiar to the FBI in part because the bureau had previously hired him to help a US inquiry into alleged corruption in the The FBI sometimes pays informants sources and outside investigators to assist in its work Steele was known for the quality of his past work and for the knowledge he had developed over nearly 20 years working on Russia-related issues for British intelligence The Washington Post was not able to determine how much the FBI intended to pay Steele had their relationship remained intactThe dossier he produced last year alleged among other things that associates of Trump colluded with the Kremlin on cyberattacks on Democrats and that the Russians held compromising material about the Republican nomineeThese and other explosive claims have not been verified and they have been  by Trump and his alliesThe FBI as well as the Senate Intelligence Committee is investigating Russian interference in the election and alleged contacts between Trumps associates and the KremlinOn Tuesday House Speaker Paul D Ryan (R-Wis) told reporters that he had seen no evidence so far of Trump campaign contacts with Russia but said a bipartisan House inquiry would proceed so that no stone is unturnedThe revelation that the FBI agreed to pay Steele at the same time he was being paid by Clinton supporters to dig into Trumps background could further strain relations between the law enforcement agency and the White HouseA spokesman for the FBI declined to comment Steeles London-based attorney did not respond to questions about the agreementWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer declined to commentSteele 53 began his Trump investigation in June 2016 after working for another client preparing a report on Russian efforts to interfere with politics in EuropeUS intelligence had been independently tracking Russian efforts to influence electoral outcomes in EuropeSteele was hired to work for a Washington research firm Fusion GPS that was providing information to a Democratic client Fusion GPS began doing Trump research in early 2016 before it hired Steele on behalf of a Republican opposed to the businessmans candidacy The firm declined to identify its clientsSteeles early reports alleged a plan directed by Russian President Vladimir Putin to help Trump in 2016Russian regime has been cultivating supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years Steele wrote in JuneSteeles information was provided by an intermediary to the FBI and US intelligence officials after the Democratic National Convention in July when were first released by WikiLeaks according to a source familiar with the events After the convention Steele contacted a friend in the FBI to personally explain what he had foundAs summer turned to fall Steele became concerned that the US government was not taking the information he had uncovered seriously enough according to two people familiar with the situationIn October anticipating that funding supplied through the original client would dry up Steele and the FBI reached a spoken understanding He would continue his work looking at the Kremlins ties to Trump and receive compensation for his effortsBut Steeles frustration deepened when FBI Director James B Comey who had been silent on the Russia inquiry  publicly 11 days before the election that the bureau was investigating a newly discovered cache of emails Clinton had exchanged using her private server according to people familiar with Steeles thinkingThose people say Steeles frustration with the FBI peaked after an Oct 31 New York Times story that cited law enforcement sources drawing conclusions that he considered premature The  said that the FBI had not yet found any conclusive or direct link between Trump and the Russian government and that the Russian hacking was not intended to help TrumpAfter the election the intelligence community concluded that Russias interference had been intended to assist TrumpIn January top intelligence and law enforcement officials briefed Trump and President Barack Obama on those findings In addition they provided a summary of the core allegations of Steeles dossier  News of that briefing soon became public Then BuzzFeed posted a copy of Steeles salacious but unproven dossier online sparking outrage from TrumpIts all fake news Its phony stuff It didnt happen Trump  in January It was a group of opponents that got together  sick people  and they put that crap togetherHe later tweeted that Steele was a failed spyThe development marked the end of the FBIs relationship with SteeleAfter he was publicly identified by the Wall Street Journal as the dossiers author Steele  US officials took pains to stress that his report was not a US government product and that it had not influenced their broader conclusions that the Russian government had hacked the emails of Democratic officials and released those emails with the intention of helping Trump win the presidencyThe [intelligence community] has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions then-Director of National Intelligence James R Clapper Jr said in  in JanuaryThe owner of a technology company identified in Steeles dossier as a participant in the hacks is now suing Steele and BuzzFeed for defamation BuzzFeed apologized to the executive and blocked out his name in the published documentComey spent almost two hours this month briefing the Senate Intelligence Committee Democrats in the House have informally reached out to Steele in recent weeks to ask about his willingness to testify or cooperate according to people familiar with the requests Steele has so far not responded they saidA federal judge in Washington blocked the Trump Administrations proposed transgender military ban writing in a strongly worded opinion that the policy does not appear to be supported by any factsUS District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly issued the preliminary injunction Monday finding that a group of transgender service members would have a strong chance of prevailing in their lawsuit to have the ban declared unconstitutional The injunction remains in place until the lawsuit is resolved or a judge lifts itThe move is another legal setback for the president who surprised military leaders and members of Congress when he announced the proposal  in late July that reversed an Obama administration policy allowing transgender service members to serve openly and begin enlisting in JanuaryThe tweets were followed by a presidential directive and a plan set to take effect in March that would have blocked military recruitment of transgender people and would have  of current transgender service membersThe judges injunction effectively reverts Trumps policy to the one issued under ObamaThe Obama administration announced its policy after a Pentagon review found no basis to exclude transgender people from the military after it examined medical care military readiness and other factorsThe Monday ruling was hailed by GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders (GLAD) and the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) who sued in August on behalf of six active-duty transgender service members who had come out to their superiors and had roughly 60years combined in the military It was the first of  to challenge the ban and the first significant ruling by a judge on Trumps policyThis is a complete victory for our plaintiffs and all transgender service members who are now once again able to serve on equal terms and without the threat of being discharged said NCLR Legal Director Shannon MinterDepartment of Justice spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam issued a statement saying the department is currently evaluating the next steps Department attorneys had previously asked for the suit to be dismissedPlaintiffs lawsuit challenging military service requirements is premature for many reasons including that the Defense Department is actively reviewing such service requirements as the President ordered and because none of the Plaintiffs have established that they will be impacted by current policies on military service the statement read  The six service members in the lawsuit contended that their Fifth Amendment rights to equal protection were being violated  a claim bolstered by three former Obama administration service branch chiefs and a senior Pentagon official who offered statements saying the ban would harm readiness staffing recruitment and moraleKollar-Kotelly was unsparing in her ruling saying the hastily announced Trump policy did not pass muster on many frontsThere is absolutely no support for the claim that the ongoing service of transgender people would have any negative effect on the military at all In fact there is considerable evidence that it is the discharge and banning of such individuals that would have such effects Kollar-Kotelly wroteCarl Tobias a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law said the Trump administration would likely have to go all the way to the Supreme Court to have any chance of getting the preliminary injunction nullifiedIf they go to the DC Circuit I cant imagine they are going to overturn this Tobias said The judge was strong in her opinion She just didnt see any support for the policy on the factsMore than a dozen states filed a brief in October supporting the arguments of the service members in the case writing that Trump was pursuing an irrational return to discrimination in the military  One aspect of the opinion that continued to be debated Monday was the barring of military funding for sex-reassignment surgery which is part of the banKollar-Kotellys order found that none of the plaintiffs had shown they were likely to be affected by that funding ban so the court was not in a position to rule on the propriety of this directiveTransgender advocates however insisted that the ruling allowed the military to continue to pay for such surgeries The Department of Justice declined to comment on its understanding of the ruling as it relates to the surgery issueThere is no official tally of transgender military members and estimates vary widely One recent study by the Rand Corp put the number on active duty at about 2500 while another from the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law estimated that there were 15500 on active duty in the National Guard and in the reserves Currently  allow transgender troops to serve in the militaryTrumps proposal was cheered by many religious conservatives but outraged transgender advocates and many liberals Trump blindsided many when he announced the policy on TwitterAfter consultation with my Generals and military experts please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the US Military Trump wrote in the tweets Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entailLesbian gay and transgender advocates say the ban is part of a broader pattern of discrimination by the Trump administration This month Attorney General Jeff Sessions reversed a Justice Department policy protecting transgender workers from discrimination under federal lawPresident Trump on Tuesday belittled former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos who pleaded guilty this week to lying to federal agents investigating Russias interference in the 2016 election tweeting that few people knew the young low level volunteer named George who has already proven to be a liarBut interviews and documents show that Papadopoulos was in regular contact with the Trump campaigns most senior officials and held himself out as a Trump surrogate as he traveled the world to meet with foreign officials and reportersPapadopoulos sat at the elbow of one of Trumps top campaign advisers then-Sen Jeff Sessions during a dinner for campaign advisers weeks before the Republican National Convention according to an individual who attended the meeting He met in London in September 2016 with a mid-level representative of the British Foreign Office where he said he had contacts at the senior level of the Russian government And he conferred at one point with the foreign minister of Greece at a meeting in New YorkWhile some top campaign aides appeared to rebuff  there is no sign they told him directly to cease his activities or sought to end his affiliation with the campaignEmails included in court documents released Monday show that Papadopoulos repeatedly told Trump campaign officials about his contacts with people he believed were representing the Russian governmentThe court documents do not answer a key question whether Papadopoulos also told his superiors that he had met a London-based professor who claimed to know that the Russians had dirt on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton including thousands of her emailsAn FBI agent told the court in July that Papadopoulos lied in an interview with federal agents saying he did not tell anyone on the campaign about the dirt because he thought the professor was a nothing  At 29 Papadopoulos had scant experience that qualified him to advise a presidential candidate He had entered the Trump campaign after a six-week stint working for the campaign of Trumps rival for the Republican nomination neurosurgeon Ben CarsonCarsons campaign manager Barry Bennett recalled that Papadopoulos was hired after sending him an unsolicited message via LinkedIn seeking a jobAt the time Carsons campaign was desperate to show it had policy experts advising his campaign given that most leading Republican foreign policy thinkers had been snapped up by other candidatesBennett said his only vetting was to ask a friend at the Washington-based Hudson Institute where Papadopouloss rsum indicated he had worked as a researcher whether Papadopoulos was an okay guyI wasnt looking for something stellar Bennett said I wanted to make sure he was okayFor six weeks of work Bennett said Papadopoulos was paid $8500 before he was let go from the campaign at the end of January 2016 as it shed staffBy March 2016 Trumps campaign like Carsons before it was eagerly searching for foreign policy expertise As Trump rose in the polls and won Republican primaries the former reality TV host was under pressure to announce a group of advisers with whom he was consulting on foreign policy issuesThe scrutiny intensified early that month after 70 conservative national security experts signed an open letter opposing Trumps candidacy In mid-March Trump was asked on the MSNBC show Morning Joe to name people with whom he spoke about foreign affairs Im speaking with myself number one because I have a very good brain Trump responded prompting more calls for a list of formal advisersTo come up with names the campaign turned to Sam Clovis a former Iowa radio host who served as national campaign co-chairman an attorney for Clovis confirmed Tuesday in a statementBut the statement did not address how Papadopoulos ended up on the list Bennett said he was not consulted and would not have recommended his former employee if he had been asked because he found him unimpressiveOn March 21 Trump included Papadopoulos among five men he announced were advising him on matters of national security in a meeting with The Washington Post editorial board An energy and oil consultant Excellent guy Trump said  If Trump or his team had undertaken even a cursory vetting of Papadopoulos they would have found that much of his already-slim rsum was either exaggerated or falseWhile he claimed to have served for several years as a fellow at the Hudson Institute officials there said he had been an unpaid intern and a researcher under contract to several fellows who were writing a bookAlthough he claimed to be US Representative at the 2012 Geneva International Model United Nations officials at that organization said they had no record of him Papadopoulos said he had delivered the keynote address at a leading American-Greek organization in 2008  while a student at DePaul University But records from the gathering indicate he merely participated in a youth panel with other participants The keynote was delivered by 1988 Democratic presidential candidate Michael DukakisThough Papadopouloss exaggerated rsum issues quickly became public he remained a part of the Trump advisory panel and soon began urging campaign aides to let him set up a meeting between Trump and Russian officialsCourt documents show he raised the idea at a March 31 meeting of the group attended by both Trump and Sessions who had endorsed Trumps campaign telling the group that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President [Vladimir] PutinHe also began appearing in the foreign press While visiting Israel the next month he told a group of researchers that Trump saw Putin as a responsible actor and potential partner according to a column in the Jerusalem PostIn May he told the Telegraph of London that Prime Minister David Cameron should apologize to Trump for calling the candidate divisive stupid and wrong Camerons comments had come after Trump announced that he supported a ban on Muslims entering the United StatesPapadopouloss comments were big news in Britain  and the campaign took notice JD Gordon a former Pentagon spokesman and Trump national security adviser said campaign officials were displeased and Papadopoulos was counseled that he should clear future media appearances with campaign staff and keep a low profileI was surprised to learn what George Papadopoulos was up to during the campaign he said Tuesday in a text message He obviously went to great lengths to go around me and Sen SessionsAnd yet Papadopoulos continued to be invited to campaign events In late June or early July he attended a dinner at the Capitol Hill Club along with several other national security advisers for the Trump campaign Another person who was at the meeting said Sessions also attended Papadopoulos was seated to Sessionss leftA spokeswoman for Sessions declined to commentMedia appearances by Papadopoulos continued In September he spoke extensively to Interfax telling the Russian news agency that Trump has been open about his willingness to usher in a new chapter in US-Russia relations depending on Russia acting as a responsible stake holder in the international system He also questioned the effectiveness of US sanctions on RussiaBy that time WikiLeaks had released emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee that were widely suspected to have been stolen at the direction of the Russian government Trumps warm rhetoric toward Putin had become a controversial topic on the campaign trailCourt documents show that Papadopoulos forwarded a copy of the Interfax article to a Russian woman with whom he had been corresponding during the campaign  British sources said it was around that time that he approached British government officials to say he was traveling to London and asked to be given a meeting with senior government ministers Instead he was offered a session with a mid-level official at the Foreign Office in LondonDuring the meeting Papadopoulos made a comment indicating he had contacts at the senior level of the Russian government British sources said British officials quickly concluded he was not a major or knowledgeable player in the Trump orbit and did not pursue the issue or continue contactA spokesman for the Greek Embassy said he met with that nations foreign minister in New York Spokesman Efthymios Aravantinos said the conversation was conducted as part of a routine effort that the embassy makes to reach out to Greek Americans hoping they have a sentimental attachment to Greece and that we can connectIt is not clear how much the campaign knew about Papadopouloss activities But he continued through these months to have contact with other Trump officialsIn September Papadopoulos emailed another Trump aide Boris Epshteyn and told him he planned to be in New York and hoped to set up meetings around the UN General Assembly meetingThe email was  in August of this year and is among 20000 pages of documents that the Trump campaign has turned over to the White House Congressional committees and defense attorneysPapadopoulos wrote that he wanted to connect Epshteyn with a friend Sergei Millian of the Russian American Chamber of Commerce the emails saidMillian would later be identified as a major source for the author of a dossier that included unsubstantiated salacious allegations about Trumps activities in Russia a claim Millian has denied Epshteyn said he never met Millian and declined to comment further Asked in August to describe his relationship with Papadopoulos Millian responded by email I can meet and talk to any person    Its none of your businessMillian did not respond to a request for comment TuesdayPapadopoulos continued to hold himself out as a Trump adviser even after the November election Two days after Trumps inauguration in January he met in Washington with a group of Israelis headed by Yossi Dagan a leader of the West Bank settler movement that prepared a video of the session to be shown at homeWe had an excellent meeting with Yossi and we hope that the people of Judea and Samaria  the name used by the Israeli right for the West Bank  will have a great 2017 Papadopoulos said according to the video We are looking forward to ushering in a new relationship with all of IsraelAccording to an account in the Jerusalem Post the settler leaders had been invited to attend the inauguration and meet with senators congressmen and members of the Presidents team Dagan reached by telephone Tuesday in Israel declined to comment on the visit or who had arranged the meeting with Papadopoulos While the president now seems to have left Papadopoulos behind Papadopoulos has continued to highlight the tie On LinkedIn he indicates he was a Trump adviser through January 2017 and includes the experience as the first line of his description about himselfPresident Trump recommendation about me George is an oil and gas consultant excellent guy Papadopoulos wrote Dan Balz Sari Horwitz and Devlin Barrett in Washington and Ruth Eglash in Jerusalem contributed to this reportOn Sunday morning President Trump expressed frustration that his campaign is under investigation over possible ties to Russias plot to influence the 2016 election but that his former opponent Hillary Clinton is not facing the same level of scrutinyIn four tweets sent over24 minutesTrump wroteNever seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12000000) the Uranium to Russia deal the 33000 plus deleted Emails the Comey fix and so much more Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia collusion which doesnt exist The Dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) Witch Hunt for evil politics but the Rsare now fighting back like never before There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton and now the facts are pouring out DO SOMETHINGThe tweets came as CNN has continued to report that on Friday afederal grand jury in Washington approved the  led by special counsel Robert S Mueller IIIcitingsources briefed on the matter The charges are sealed and its unclear who could be charged and for whatThe history of the dossier Trump referenced is a complicated oneDuring the 2016 Republican primaries theconservative Washington Free Beacon paid the Washington firm Fusion GPS to investigate Trumps background and eventually his business ties to Russia The Washington Post The publication receives financial support frombillionaire GOP donor Paul Singer according to two people familiar with Singer whose firmdid not respond to requests seeking commentAfter the Free Beacon stopped paying Fusion GPS the research firm offered in April 2016 to continue researching Trump for the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee The Post According to that reporting Fusion GPS then hired Christopher Steele a former British intelligence officer with ties to the FBI and the US intelligence community whocompiled a 35-page dossier on TrumpBrian Fallon a former spokesman for the Clinton campaign said he learned about Steele and the dossier after the election People familiar with the mattersaid the Clinton campaign and the DNC did not direct Steeles activitiesIts unclear how much the Clinton campaign and DNC paid for the informationThe Clinton campaign paid Perkins Coie $56 million in legal fees from June 2015 to December 2016 according to  and the DNC paid the firm $36 million in legal and compliance consulting since November 2015  though its impossible to tell from the filings how much of that work was for other legal matters and how much of it related to Fusion GPS Its unclear how Trump arrived at the $12 million figure used in his tweets  When it comes to the Uranium to Russia deal that Trump referenced in his tweetHouse and Senate Republican leaders have already  into decisions made during the Obama administration when Clinton was secretary of state involving auranium deal that increased Russias share of the US nuclear market At the same time the House Oversight Committee has launched a that will examine among other things why then-FBI Director James B Comeypublicly

on CNN ManafortMSNBC ManafortFox News Hamburger emoji  Roberto Ferdman (@robferdman)For three hours Saturday Rep Darrell Issa (R-Calif) endured pointed questions jeers and derisive laughter during two successive town halls in this northern suburb of San DiegoBut this wasnt just a moment for Issa to let anxious constituents vent their worries about immigration policy health-care reform or the first seven weeks of President Trumps tenure It was a major first test of the Democratic Partys efforts to turn antipathy toward Trump into electoral gains in 2018 It was also a chance for Issa to show that he is willing to stand apart from Trump for a district that has rapidly grown more liberal in recent yearsI do not work for the executive branch Issa said in an opening statement Saturday at one of two morning town hall meetings at a community center here I investigated the Obama administration I also investigated the Bush administrationIssa 63 has been distancing himself from Trump for some time Widely seen as a partisan flamethrower during his years leading the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and its many investigations of the Obama administration Issa is more likely these days to defend the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency or to demand a rigorous investigation into allegations of Russian intervention in the 2016 electionHe has good reason to moderate Californias 49th Congressional District which encompasses the increasingly diverse and liberal suburban cities in northern San Diego County and southern Orange County is no longer the safely Republican terrain that it was for Issas first eight elections to CongressLast year Issa won narrowly against a lawyer and retired Marine colonel Douglas Applegate who has announced plans to challenge him again in 2018 Last week environmental lawyer Mike Levin another Democrat announced that he too plans to challenge IssaOn Saturday one questioner noted that some Democrats have wondered whether Trump is too emotionally unstable to be trusted with nuclear weaponsIssas answer stopped short of a full-throated show of support for the new commander in chief If the issue comes up in front of the appropriate body he said I will vote my conscienceYet Issas attempts to distance himself from Trump were met with derision and boos When he referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin as an evil son of a blank who sows chaos and then capitalizes on it an audience member yelled so does Trump The crowd cheeredA protester outside the community center held a sign that seemed to sum up the attitude of many if not most of the more than 1000 who attended the two sessions Repeal and Replace the PresidentOne man wore a Russian military hat Another wore a T-shirt that read Trump-Putin 16 A woman held a sign Russia-Gate Follow the Money Another had a shirt signaling that she is a nasty woman a jibe Trump aimed at Hillary Clinton during a presidential campaign debateBetween the two sessions a reporter asked Issa whether he is worried about the 2018 congressional election becoming a referendum on TrumpI dont care he said Fact is that Im going to be with Trump sometimes against him sometimesOnly a few of Issas colleagues held town hall meetings after Congresss workweek ended but questions about the American Health Care Act as the House GOP plan to replace the Affordable Care Act is known were rampant Rep Douglas A Collins (R-Ga) a supporter of the bill was confronted in a Friday night tele-town hall by a man named Bill who demanded that Republicans pass the repeal package of 2015 That has been the plan favored by Sen Rand Paul (R-Ky) and most of the conservative House Freedom Caucus   Collins assured the constituent that the 2015 bill is in this package thats going to be sent to the president which is not true as the AHCA keeps some parts of the ACA that Republicans formerly voted to repealRep Ron DeSantis (R-Fla) a Freedom Caucus member whose district backed Trump by 17points told a morning crowd in St Augustine that he wasnt ready to back the billI dont think you can come to grips with the bill in 36 hours I dont DeSantis said Im not sure it does enough to lower the costs of health careDeSantis was booed when he praised the idea of expanding health savings accounts a part of the GOPs plans he also said that a viral moment from a CNN interview he did where he appeared to be saying that cancer patients could get coverage at emergency rooms was misinterpreted He was received more sympathetically when he criticized the bill saying that as structured it might lead to higher premiumsIf you do it right people are going to have access to cheaper plans DeSantis said If you dont Im not sure its going to reduce costsIssa faced questions about the Affordable Care Act too He did not fully buy into the current GOP plan being promoted by House Speaker Paul D Ryan (R-Wis) But he didnt help himself with many in the crowd when he referred to the ACA as Obamacare which prompted the audience to boo and cry out the Affordable Care ActIssa responded sharply Hey its not affordableAs at so many other town halls across the country in recent weeks no one asked Issa about local issues not even about a recent deployment of Marines from nearby Camp Pendleton to Syria  That suggests that the electorate is primed to turn the 2018 election into a referendum on Trump  something of which Democrats are likely to try to take advantageAfter last years squeaker election in the 49th District Democrats listed Issa as among the most vulnerable Republican incumbents in 2018 The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has hired a full-time organizer in the district In response the GOP campaign committee has included Issa among 10 House incumbents who will receive additional help from the partyWhile most of the crowd Saturday was markedly anti-Trump a smattering of the presidents supporters were present some wearing the red Make America Great Again campaign hats A bare-chested man outside held a sign asking Whats Not To Like about Trumps viewsRepeatedly Issa asked questioners to be succinct  and implored the rest of the audience to not drown out the question or answer His goal for the meeting was modest he joked with the crowdThe only thing I ask is that it not end like [the play] Hamilton he said referring to Alexander Hamiltons untimely death in a duel with Aaron Burr David Weigel in Fort Lauderdale Fla contributed to this reportWikiLeaks released yet another batch of hacked emails from inside Hillary Clintons campaign Wednesday and with them came another round of embarrassing headlines and new glimpses of internal anxiety over the candidates weaknessesRepublican Donald Trump and his allies seized on the emails which reveal comments by an aide about Catholics a line from a paid speech in which Clinton might be seen as playing down the threat of terrorism and an internal dispute over potential conflicts of interest posed by the Clinton FoundationThe drip-drip-drip of damaging attention is likely to continue WikiLeaks the anti-secrecy organization began releasing new messages last Friday from the personal email account of Clintons campaign chairman John Podesta and has promised to issue tens of thousands moreThe correspondence reveals a campaign that has struggled all year to improve a flawed candidate As far back as March aides were keenly aware that she was resistant to the media perhaps out of touch with regular Americans and unable to convey a clear message to votersA month before Clinton launched her campaign her aides worked to corral her well-known love for granular policy details into a message that would both capture her agenda and present a forward-looking aspirational vision for her presidencyNearly a year later a similar struggle cropped up as they attempted to revise her core campaign messageDo we have any sense from her what she believes or wants her core message to be asked Clinton adviser Joel BenensonBenenson contrasted the simplicity of Bernie Sanderss anti-Wall Street message with Clintons multitiered campaign slogansSeven months later and on the cusp of Election Day the concerns laid out in these emails and others largely remain Clinton has proven to be a lackluster candidate who has struggled to win over the liberals who gravitated to Sanders during the primary and who remains ahead in large part due to Trumps historic weaknessesRight now I am petrified that Hillary is almost totally dependent on Republicans nominating Trump Brent Budowsky a political columnist and former political adviser wrote in a March 2016 email to Podesta and Roy Spence an ad maker for the campaign She has huge endemic political weaknesses that she would be wise to rectifyEven a clown like Ted Cruz would be an even money bet to beat and this scares the hell of out me Budowsky addedIndeed at least one aide Benenson believed that Marco Rubio posed the greatest threat to Clinton if he were to become the Republican nomineeHovering over the trickle of embarrassing emails are suspicions both within the Clinton campaign and in intelligence circles that Russia is behind the hack The FBI is investigating the cyber incident as part of a broader inquiry into Russian hacking of political organizations such as the Democratic National Committee law enforcement officials said Clinton and her allies have linked the hacking to an attempt by the Russians to influence an American electionBy dribbling these out every day WikiLeaks is proving they are nothing but a propaganda arm of the Kremlin with a political agenda doing Putins dirty work to help elect Donald Trump said Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin The FBI is now investigating this crime The unanswered questions are why Donald Trump strangely wont condemn it and whether any of his associates are involvedRegardless the emails are likely to be a source of headaches for Clinton from now until Election Day The Clinton campaign has declined to confirm the authenticity of the emails nor has it denied itAt a Wednesday afternoon rally in Lakeland Fla Trump called the WikiLeaks revelations big stuff and repeatedly slammed his Democratic rival over themThe Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake on Nov 8 She would be the most dishonest and the most corrupt person ever elected to high office Trump told the crowdHis campaign held a conference call with reporters singling out an exchange showing campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri describing people who convert to CatholicismI imagine they think it is the most socially acceptable politically conservative religion  their rich friends wouldnt understand if they became evangelicals Palmieri wrote according to WikiLeaks Palmieri who is Catholic said Wednesday aboard Clintons campaign plane that she has no recollection of the emailHouse Speaker Paul D Ryan (R-Wis) seized on the email in a statement denouncing the Clinton campaigns disdain for the Catholic faith although he cited a portion of the email not written by Palmieri or any other Clinton staffer The emails also show the campaigns internal struggle with how best to address the controversy surrounding the use of an email server while Clinton was at the State Department and her resistance to her aides counsel about how best to but the issue asideIn March 2015 Nick Merrill now Clintons traveling press secretary wrote to Palmieri suggesting that Clinton sit down with comedian and writer Larry Wilmore who was already scheduled to appear with Bill and Chelsea Clinton at a Clinton Global Initiative eventHRC is not slated to join but maybe she should Merrill wrote suggesting Wilmore could make a joke about hearing Hillary Clinton is a big emailer As the email issue persisted top aide Huma Abedin asked Clintons advisers in May 2015 whether Clinton could survive not answering questions from press at events during the first leg of the campaign when she rolled out new policyIn the fall starting to do avails at message events interviews and Q and A with press but having had a series of policy proposals already announced and reported on that she could point to Abedin suggested seemingly to relay Clintons thinking to a number of top aidesPodesta disagreed in no uncertain termsIf she thinks we can get to Labor Day without taking press questions I think thats suicidal Podesta wrote We have to find some mechanism to let the stream out of the pressure cookerA similar debate re-emerged in 2016 after Clinton went months without answering questions from her traveling press only to change course after Labor Day with more frequent news conferencesStill unable to lay the email issue to rest in 2015 Clintons aides talked about their effort to persuade Clinton to use the decision to turn over her server to the Justice Department as an opportunity for her to be seen as having dealt with the issueIt is clear that she is not in same place (unless John has a convo with her and gets her in a different place) Palmieri wrote in August 2015To this day Clintons email server is a major part of Trumps case against her and is regularly cited by voters as among the reasons they dont trust herThe battle with Sanders also proved challenging Campaign aides sought to balance the need to reduce the damage his candidacy did to hers by bringing the primary to an end while also not alienating his liberal supporters whom she planned to rely in during the general electionIn the wake of Sanderss resounding defeat of Clinton in the New Hampshire primary the emails show top Clinton advisers discussing ways to slow the momentum of the senator from Vermont a self-described democratic socialistIn one email Clinton adviser Mandy Grunwald discusses several possible lines of attack including one under the header FREE STUFF FOR EVERYBODYCombined Sanders proposals would put the government in control of more than half of the American economy but Sanders has never told anyone who would pay for all of this or how it would work she wroteOthers warned against attacking Sanders too hard  and risking turning away his supportersThe emails show that Clintons campaign also worried about the influence of Sen Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) over the left wing of the party and the possibility that she might endorse SandersIn October 2015 as Sanders was attracting huge crowds on the campaign trail Grunwald asked whether Clinton should modify her views on a proposed banking regulation to mollify WarrenI am still worried that we will antagonize and activate Elizabeth Warren by opposing a new Glass-Steagall Grunwald wrote I worry about defending the banks in the debateAn excerpt of one of Clintons paid speeches show some aides were concerned that her comments seemed like an admission that she is out of touchAnd Clinton mused about her own shortcomings and challenges with being a more authentic candidate in an off-the-record interview she had with New York Times journalist Mark Leibovich in the summer of 2015Im trying to let people into my life she said according to the transcript Im trying to relate to people  not relate to them you know talk about being a grandmother  talk about you know the experiences I had growing up and all that Talk about my own mother And in that way kind of make connectionsThe leaked emails also offer a glimpse of the often plodding nature of her campaign While Trump often speaks off the cuff  and his staff doesnt even know some of what hell say  most everything Clinton does is scriptedOn an email chain in October 2015 that included more than a dozen aides there was great debate over whether Clinton should tell a joke at an Iowa dinner about her grueling 11-hour testimony before a House panel investigating the Benghazi attackAs described the joke which was apparently suggested by Bill Clinton involved the former secretary of state half-expecting Sanders to burst in during hour eight of her testimony and repeat his famous debate line Enough about your damn emails HillaryIn the end the line never saw the light of dayI defer if others think this buys us good will with Sanders people Podesta wrote But email jokes in Iowa usually end up badly and dont we want to move on Anu Narayanswamy Sean Sullivan Carol Morello and Ellen Nakashima contributed to this reportWhen BuzzFeed published that now-infamous dossier of unproven claims about Donald Trump and Russia in January former Hillary Clinton campaign aides expressed outrage that news outletsthat had obtained the dossier before Election Day did not make its contents public in time to influence voters and Clinton lateraired the same grievancein her book about the presidential raceIt turns out that the reaction of the Democratic presidential nominee and her team was disingenuous The Washington Post reported on Tuesday night that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee helpedfund the dossier compiled by a former British intelligence officer through a law firm hired to conduct opposition researchThe Clinton camp left out its own role in the dossiers creation as it ripped the media for sitting on information that journalists had been unable to verify What Clinton and her advisers presented as their judgment that themedia had made the wrong call was in fact their frustration at having failed to plant negative news reports before ballots were cast  Recall that BuzzFeed published the dossier in full on Jan 10 after CNN reported that the FBI had briefed President Barack Obama and then-President-elect Trump on its contents Many journalists criticized BuzzFeeds decision arguing that news outlets should not spread claims they cant corroborate even if the FBI considers the claims significant enough to share with the president and his soon-to-be successorBut Clinton press aides Brian Fallon and Nick Merrill contended on Twitter that the real journalistic malpractice was not publishing information contained in the dossier earlierThis was long rumored during the campaign and many reporters know at least some of what Russia was alleged to have Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) Today has brought a gush of reporting that outlets knew about and sat on prior to November 8cc  Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) I repeat certain media outlets were told this prior to November 8 Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) In fact if we want to get specific one outlet a very very prominent outlet threw cold water on this when Slate beat them to the punch  Nick Merrill (@NickMerrill) Merrill was referring to the New York Times which  on Oct 31 2016 that the FBI had chased a lead  which they ultimately came to doubt  about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank Journalist Franklin Foer had reported on the possible secret channel earlier that dayAlso that day Mother Jones magazine  that a former senior intelligence officer for a Western countryhadprovided the [FBI] with memos based on his recent interactions with Russian sources contending the Russian government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trump  and that the FBI requested more information from him The memos comprised the dossier that BuzzFeed later publishedConsistent with the Mother Jones report the Times reported that intelligence officials have said in interviews over the last six weeks that apparent connections between some of Mr Trumps aides and Moscow originally compelled them to open a broad investigation into possible links between the Russian government and the Republican presidential candidateStill the Times added throwing the cold water Merrill spoke of they have said that Mr Trump himself has not become a target And no evidence has emerged that would link him or anyone else in his business or political circle directly to Russias election operationsClinton complained about the Times report in her post-election book What HappenedIn the summer of 2016 according to The Washington Post the FBI convinced a special Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that there was probably cause to believe that Trump adviser Carter Page was acting as a Russian agent and the received a warrant to monitor his communications The FBI also began investigating a dossier prepared by a well-respected former British spy that contained explosive and salacious allegations about compromising information the Russians had on Trump The intelligence community took the dossier seriously enough that it briefed both President Obama and President-elect Trump on its contents before the inaugurationSources within the FBI also convinced the New York Times to run a story saying they saw no clear link to Russia countering Franklin Foers scoop in Slate about unusual computer traffic between Trump Tower and a Russian bankNote that Clinton described the dossier only as having been prepared by a well-respected former British spy  as if the spy Christopher Steele had acted on his own Clinton certainly gave no indication that her campaign helped finance his workThere is a fundamental contradiction here Clinton wanted the dossier to be viewed as credible yet she did not want to be connected to it She hoped the media before Election Day would publish claims about Trump to which she was unwilling to attach her own nameThe nations capital lost out on hosting the Gay Games 2022 to Hong Kong the federation of Gay Games announced Monday afternoon Mayor Muriel E Bowser (D) and 23 city representatives

its purpose was to basically cover up and shift away to the side the Clinton involvement in the Trump dossier It was a classic case of distractionHe added And none of it I can tell you with

reporting whats really going on Clinton said adding It appears they dont know Im not presidentPaul Manafort known to his friends as having a pricey lifestyle with tailored suits choice seats at Yankee Stadium and a house in the Hamptons appeared to experience some turbulence in 2004A Florida horse farm he owned with his wife faced the threat of foreclosure according to property records and he used his Virginia house as collateral for a quarter-million-dollar loan After bursting on the Washington scene in the 1970s and 1980s working for the likes of Gerald R Ford Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush his political consulting career had largely disappeared from viewIn 2005 Manaforts fortunes seemed to improveHe signed on as an adviser to a Ukrainian steel magnate who according to people who worked there with Manafort connected him with one of the countrys most powerful politicians Viktor Yanukovych Back home corporations linked to Manafort purchased a unit in Trump Tower for $37million and then two other high-priced apartments in New York while Manafort and his wife bought a new house in FloridaThis spring Manafort returned to the US spotlight from the wilderness of Eastern European politics and business to run Republican Donald Trumps presidential campaign Manafort was considered a steady professional who could stabilize the chaotic operation while the campaign offered him a chance to reclaim a major role in US politics Manaforts reentry sputtered this week as Trump diminished his role selecting two other strategists to take charge even as Manafort retained his title of chairmanThe campaign shake-up followed reports this week that Manaforts name had surfaced in an inquiry by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of UkraineThe agency has been investigating claims that Yanukovych who won the presidency with Manaforts help in 2010 and others aligned with his Party of Regions stole up to $100billion in assets before Yanukovych fled to Russia in 2014Investigators said this week that they discovered a black ledger showing that $127million had been designated for Manafort between 2007 and 2012 by Yanukovychs party The anti-corruption agency published a list Thursday on its  page of the alleged payments showing 22 installments assigned to ManafortManafort issued a strong denial this week in response to reports of the alleged payments saying that he never received a single off-the-books cash payment and that he never represented the governments of Ukraine or Russia He said his firm received payments for political work in the country and called the alleged secret cash payments first reported by the New York Times unfounded silly and nonsensicalNeither Manafort nor his attorney responded to requests for further commentThe discovery of the ledger could trigger scrutiny of Manaforts connections to Ukraine by FBI officials who have been on the ground in Kiev working under a June agreement with the anti-corruption agencyFBI officials declined to comment on the specifics of the agencys involvement Peter Carr a spokesman said that we remain committed to helping recover stolen assets on behalf of the people of UkraineManaforts 2005 entry into Ukrainian politics and finances came when he signed on as an adviser to the steel magnate Rinat Akhmetov one of Ukraines richest oligarchs and a key supporter of Yanukovych and the Party of Regions according to interviews with Ukrainians and Americans who worked with ManafortManaforts first job was to burnish the local and international reputation of a company owned by Akhmetov based in the Russian-speaking industrial Donetsk regionAkhmetov was one of several oligarchs involved with the Party of Regions which was led largely by men who made a quick fortune after the Soviet Union dissolved and Ukraine became a financial free-for-allThe report said that a third of the 50 wealthiest oligarchs in Ukraine belonged to the party and together had an estimated wealth of $354billion according to a report by the private intelligence firm StratforOver time Manaforts role with the party expanded He was tasked with rehabilitating the image of the partys leader Yanukovych who had been imprisoned twice according to people familiar with Manaforts work thereIt was in the words of John E Herbst the US ambassador at the time an extreme makeover according to a cable he sent Washington that was subsequently published by the WikiLeaks organizationManafort and half a dozen businessmen lawyers and political analysts involved in Ukraine at the time brought discipline and focus that the Yanukovych-led campaigns had lackedHe got Yanukovych to comb his hair better to stay on message during public appearances and to adopt the kind of sharp rhetoric that had worked so well for Manaforts mentor Republican strategist Lee AtwaterPaul gave the team a belief in victory said Hanna Herman a former press secretary and close adviser to Yanukovych That was his higher purpose Then all the professional American tactics he brought also helpedTaras Chornovil a former member of the Party of Regions recalled in an interview how Manafort provided image consulting to Yanukovych and members of his party during the parliamentary elections of 2006 and 2007 seeking to soften the edges of politicians from the rough industrial cities in Ukraines southeastHe drilled them on talking points and told them what suits to wearHe tried to control everything Chornovil recalled How people who represented the party would be dressed the words they said their makeup and the stylists Every small detailYevgen Kopachko a pollster who worked with Yanukovych on parliamentary and presidential campaigns said that Manafort had a phenomenal ability to work with sociological informationUkrainian political consultants said that Yanukovych grew to trust Manafort and that Yanukovychs victory in the 2010 presidential election was considered proof that Manaforts approach was successfulSince Yanukovych became president that means he worked pretty effectively said Boris Kolesnikov a former Party of Regions lawmaker and Yanukovych allyIn Washington Manafort and his team met with State Department officials and other opinion leaders to convince them that Yanukovych was a pro-Western democrat who supported NATO and was willing to work more closely with Washington said several colleagues and former US officials Manafort tried to influence US officials into thinking that Yanukovych was redeemable a guy who could be oriented toward the West said one former senior State Department official who met with him at the time and spoke on the condition of anonymityManafort did not however register as a foreign agent or as a lobbyist in Washington for his work with Ukraine Two well-known Washington firms that helped with the Ukrainian lobbying effort  Mercury LLC and the Podesta Group  registered as lobbyists but not as foreign agentsAlthough it is common for US political consultants to work for overseas candidates and political parties ethics experts say that anyone who is directly paid by a foreign government or political party for work in the United States must register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act Officials at Mercury a Republican-leaning firm and Podesta a Democratic-oriented firm led by Tony Podesta the brother of Hillary Clinton adviser John D Podesta said they received signed assurances that the money they received came from a Brussels-based nonprofit called the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine not from any government or political party The two lobbying firms whose work linked to Manafort was first reported by the  registered under the Lobbying Disclosure Act rather than the Foreign Agents Registration Act on the advice of an attorney Had the firms been advised that the foreign-agent registry was appropriate we would have gladly registered under FARA said Kimberley Fritts chief executive of the Podesta GroupAs Manafort built a political consulting practice in Ukraine he also developed financial connections with wealthy figures in the region some of whom face ongoing scrutiny from the Justice DepartmentIn 2008 he tried to develop an $850million Manhattan luxury apartment project with Dmitry Firtash a Ukrainian energy tycoon with a history of legal trouble US prosecutors charged Firtash in 2013 with money-laundering and bribery as part of a broad international corruption investigation and have sought his extradition although Firtashs attorneys have called the effort politically motivatedManaforts alleged role in the deal was detailed in documents submitted as part of a 2011 New York lawsuit that accused Firtash of working with Manafort and others to invest ill-gotten profits from energy transactions in Ukraine Manafort denied wrongdoing and the case against Manafort and Firtashs energy company ultimately was dismissedIn another business venture Oleg Deripaska a Russian aluminum magnate accused Manafort in a court in the Cayman Islands of taking nearly $19million intended for investments then not accounting for the money returning it or responding to numerous inquiries about exactly how the money was usedIn his legal filing Deripaska said he expected that the money would be used to make acquisitions in Russia Ukraine and other countries in eastern and southern Europe Instead the petition argues the partnership made only one purchase buying a stake in Ukrainian cable television and Internet ventures Deripaska squeezed by the 2008 credit crunch asked for the partnership to be liquidated and his money returned according to Deripaskas petition But the filing said it was unclear who was controlling the Ukrainian cable TV and Internet assets and what happened to the money Deripaska initially provided Richard Hibey Manaforts attorney did not respond to repeated Washington Post requests for comment on the current status of the disputeManaforts financial connections to the region along with those of other top Trump advisers have fueled concerns among US national security experts about Trumps foreign policy positions which included praising Russian President Vladimir Putin and expressing some doubt about the US commitment to NATO countries that have not paid their share of defense costsAs the controversy regarding Manafort and Ukraine swelled this week Manafort said he had cut his ties with his Ukrainian client in 2014But colleagues in Kiev and Moscow said he continued to work for the Party of Regions now called the Opposition Bloc led by Yanukovychs former chief of staff and was seen in the country as recently as last yearHe was with the Opposition Bloc said one colleague who said he saw him in Kiev in October adding that Manafort said he was in Kiev to negotiate for money he was owed for consulting with the new partyUkrainian business registration records reviewed by The Post show that Manafort did not officially close his business in Kiev until April 2016 the month after he joined the Trump campaign Roth reported from Kiev Natalie Gryvnyak in Kiev and Rosalind S Helderman Alice Crites and Anu Narayanswamy in Washington contributed to this reportIf President Trump is the finicky client describing what he wants for a monstrous wall-building project along the Mexican border Stephen Colbert is the flummoxed architect trying to fashion a blueprint from his bombastic adjectivesOn The Late Show Friday night Colbert assembled a team of builders to come up with a ballpark estimate of how much it would cost to erect the presidents promised wallThe answer a lot based on Trumps descriptionsThat wall is going to be so big and so strong and so powerful then-candidate Trump said at a campaign stop in Holderness NHImpenetrable physical tall powerful he said in another speechWe know the length of the United States southern border  about 2000miles Colbert said  and Trump gave people watching the GOP debate in Houston a sense of how tall it would be A heck of a lot taller than the ceiling youre looking atThat was all Colbert needed to pull out his whiteboard and start in on some simple calculations  Colberts efforts are a comedic version of what builders have been doing since Trump was elected after making campaign promises about a massive border wallUS Customs and Border Protection has said it plans to start awarding contracts for the wall by mid-April  Concept papers were due Friday  its unclear whether Colbert submitted oneThe candidate field will be narrowed by March 20 and finalists would submit offers with their proposed costs by March 24Trump has suggested the wall would cost $12 billion the AP reported Republican leaders say it would cost between $12 billion and $15 billion although an internal Department of Homeland Security report for Secretary John F Kelly said the final total could reach $21 billion  Colberts estimate came in a heck of a lot higher  200 million cubic yards of wall his team of builders concluded would mean $400 billion  just for concreteThat number more than doubled to $985 billion when the team factored in other costs  12000 workers portable concrete plants a road next to the wall and the cost of draining swamps along the borderTotal cost $2 trillionBut that doesnt account for another of Trumps adjectives beautiful Beautifying the border wall would take something like 100 million rolls of wallpaper one of Colberts experts estimatedClearly the costs were adding up Fortunately  at least for the United States  Trump has announced where he would send the billAnd Colbert had the Mexican Consulate on speed dialThis is Stephen Colbert from The Late Show  he told the woman who answered the phone Were trying to come up with just some rough numbers Obviously dont hold my feet to the fire over this but weve got a rough number of $2 trillion to build the border wall and I was wondering if you had that in petty cash right nowFor hundreds of years this small-scale city in Englands industrial north has been synonymous with pottery  colorful plates bowls and tiles fired by workers in the heat of the local kilns and sold in fine ceramics shops the world overBut come Thursday Stoke-on-Trent could be known less for shaping crockery than for smashing itThe British political order virtually unchanged for a century as the Conservative and Labour parties have traded control is under threat of a populist-infused realignment as the UK Independence Party seeks to capitalize on its success inHaving helped to push Britain toward the departure lounge of the European Union the anti-immigration UKIP is now seeking to displace Labour as the countrys natural home for working-class votersAnd a Thursday election here to fill a vacant parliamentary seat while minor in the overall calculus of British power could be a telling indicator of just how far the countrys politics have shifted in Brexits wakeTo the right-wing UKIP the seat represents a prime opportunity to break through with working-class voters who have for decades habitually backed the center-left Labour Party but who feel increasingly disconnected from the partys cosmopolitan white-collar outlookKnown for its pottery  the area is blessed with exceptional clay  Stoke still produces vast quantities But its once-burgeoning coal industry has disappeared and the areas tidy central shopping district is pocked with vacant storefrontsLike Rust Belt residents who helped deliver the White House to Donald Trump Stokes working class last year defied the pleas of Labour leaders who advocated for Britain to stay in the EU and instead made this city the Brexit capital of Britain  with nearly 70percent of voters opting for outNow UKIP is hoping to convert those Brexit voters into supporters and in the process win just its third parliamentary seat since its founding nearly a quarter-century agoPolitics is changing said Paul Nuttall a mild-mannered academic who succeeded the bombastic Nigel Farage as UKIP leader and is campaigning to represent Stoke Its not just changing in this country Its changing all over the worldUnlike Farage who focused UKIP firepower in the more traditionally conservative country landscapes of southern England Nuttall has zeroed in on the struggling postindustrial centers of Englands north Traditionally Labour strongholds they have become vulnerable as the party has become more detached from its roots Nuttall said in an interview at the partys purple-streaked offices in the citys centerThe Labour Party is more London-centric than its ever been They talk about the issues that may concern an Islington dinner party  climate change Palestine free trade human rights Nuttall said referring to the trendy north-London neighborhood that happens to be home to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn But those are not the issues on the doorstep in working-class areas Those issues are immigration cutting foreign-aid budgets law and order and putting British people firstThe echoes of Trump are no accident even if Nuttall insists that unlike Farage    he didnt support the New York billionaireUKIP is hoping to use at least part of the Trump playbook and ride a populist wave to powerBut Labour has recognized the threat and is waging a determined battle to keep a seat it has held for nearly 70 years from falling into the hands of the far rightThis is a defining moment said Jack Dromey a Labour member of Parliament who is directing the partys campaign here Its the moment where either UKIP breaks through or we turn the tide against a grotesque populism purporting to be the party of the working classDromey a former union leader said voters in areas such as Stoke were right to feel discontent with a political establishment that hasnt always defended the interests of the working classTheres a distinct pride in Stoke Theres also a sense that Stoke is not the city it once was he said as party activists rushed in and out of party headquarters bearing stacks of red Labour leaflets I understand why people feel the way they doBut he depicted UKIP and Nuttall as opportunists seeking to capitalize on the working classs grievances for their own gainsUKIP is a party with no answers he said They simply seek to exploit discontentAnalysts say the outcome of Thursdays contest is impossible to predict with Labour UKIP and even the ruling Conservatives jousting over a seat that is normally so comfortably in Labours column that a vote count is hardly neededRob Ford a University of Manchester political scientist who co-wrote a book on UKIP said that Stoke with its high concentration of white working-class and less-educated voters is exactly the sort of seat UKIP has long covetedOn paper its an area where UKIP should do well he saidBut paradoxically its success in pushing Britain toward Brexit  and Prime Minister Theresa Mays insistence on following through on UKIP demands for a clean break with Europe  may have blunted the partys appeal By promising to deliver on UKIPs core demand May and her ruling Conservative Party have co-opted the anger that fed last years referendum vote at least for the time beingThe large dissatisfied and distrustful element is still out there Its just that theyre unusually happy right now Ford said They wont stay that way for too longIf UKIP comes up short in Stoke it would mark a significant setback to Nuttalls strategy of broadening UKIPs appeal by targeting working-class voters The UKIP leader  who was Farages longtime deputy  has already been damaged by claims he inflated his connections to the 1989 Hillsborough disaster when 96 soccer fans were crushed to death at a crowded stadiumBut in many ways Labour and its leader Corbyn have more on the line The party is suffering from historically bad polling figures that should they hold point to a Tory rout in the next general election in 2020On Thursday Labour faces the prospect of losing not only Stoke but also another traditionally safe Labour seat Copeland where the Tories are running hardCorbyn who shocked Britain by emerging from the far-left backbenches to become party leader in late 2015 has been unable to satisfy the partys pro-EU progressive wing or its Euroskeptical working-class base If his party loses both seats Thursday Labour could drift even further into the political wildernessCorbyn is not their only problem Ford said But hes made all their problems worseThose problems are easy enough to see on the streets of StokeTo Peter Doyle a cheerful pub and hotel owner Corbyn is a waste of space who hasnt used his role to defend Britain from the most dire impacts of Brexit Instead of Labour which sometimes gets his vote Doyle will be backing the ardently pro-EU Liberal DemocratsIm in business Doyle said Ive just come through one of the biggest recessions in British history I dont want to go through another oneBut to Graham Patrick a longtime pottery worker who is now retired Labours opposition to Brexit marks it as out of touchLabour hasnt done much for us said Patrick who wore a faded blue Yankees cap with a purple UKIP

civil rights history Among the invitees President Obama and former presidents George W Bush and Bill ClintonLewis said on Meet the Press that he would not extend an invitation to TrumpThe Chinese tourists were hesitant for a second perhaps startled by their North Korean guides perfect use of Chinese curse words perhaps surprised by the sentimentF--- the Japanese devils F--- their mothers Mr Lee the guide shouted out to a busload of visitors making a day trip across the Yalu River into Sinuiju North KoreaRecovering from their initial surprise most of the middle-aged Chinese visitors joined in F--- the Japanese devils F--- their mothers they cheered back with whistles and clapping in an expletive-filled echoIt was a bonding moment between the neighborsThe excursion into North Korea from this border town in northeastern China took a group of 51 Chinese tourists by turns curious and nostalgic into the land of the Kims Their small green bus which carried them over the river and back in time was for Chinese visitors only The people on the bus did not want to be fully identified because it could go badly for them but here is their accountIts like going back to elementary school said Lin a professor from Fujian And that was not criticismFirst stop a central square in Sinuiju with its new bronze statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il the first two generations of the worlds only communist dynasty The tourists were told to get gaudy bunches of flowers  at $3 a pop that was $150 for North Korea  to place at the feet of the two KimsThey had not even left the square before the flower vendors began clearing away the flowers and placing them back in their plastic baskets for the next wave of tourists They should at least wait until we leave said Gu a middle-aged businesswoman from Shenzhen They need to work on their skillsRelations between Beijing and Pyongyang have become strained in recent years as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has repeatedly defied and snubbed Xi Jinping the Chinese president who is three decades his senior and many multiples his powerBut even as economic and political ties wobble tourism has become an important source of foreign revenue for North Korea and it is more easily extracted from Chinese tourists who tend to be obedient and sympathetic than say Americans who have proved less so   Many Chinese come for what might be described as communostalgia  a chance to reminisce about the good old days of iron-fisted central planningWith Sinuiju not having a lot of what would be called in any other country tourist attractions the next stop was a museum at which the guide talked crying about the time Kim Il Sung visited The unfazed Chinese tourists quietly waited for it to endLuckily they soon found themselves in the museum gift shop where cases displayed creams and lotions made in the local cosmetics factory  another of Sinuijus attractionsThis stuff is so cheap And its natural and pure North Korea isnt polluted like China Gu said She bought a dozen gift sets That was $550 more for North KoreaBack on the bus Mr Lee a slickly dressed 27-year-old started his anti-Japanese tirade simultaneously shocking and uniting his audience But he did allow that not all Japanese people are bad   Then Mr Lee led the group into a restaurant designed for tourists After a lunch of fried fish kimchi glass noodles and pork with potato North Korean women in bright traditional dress began singing old Red Army songs transporting the older Chinese tourists back to their youths Gu and her friends had tears in their eyes These are songs we sang when we were growing up one saidPretty young North Korean women took middle-aged Chinese men with beer bellies by the hand and dragged them onstage to sing together while the guides snapped photosThe North Korean tour guides were perhaps better proponents of Chinese nationalism than the officials Xi has dispatched to try to whip up domestic fervorAfter another gift shop the final stop on the tour was a kindergarten where 5-year-olds welcomed the tourists in Korean and Chinese The most popular performance featured five boys dressed as North Korean soldiers going through field exercises Then out came two dressed as Japanese soldiers with rats tails and then one as a senior American officer with a wolfs tail The Chinese tourists lapped it upYoung kids in China these days are too spoiled too materialistic said Qi a man from Liaoning province We should have more nationalist education in our schools Look at North Korea They know how to educate kidsAt the end of the performance one of the guides announced that the teachers would happily accept any gifts for the children Some tourists offered pencils cookies and sausages they had brought from ChinaOn the bus others felt bad they had nothing to give Not to worry Mr Lee had a planThe children had trained for a whole year for this performance he said They have eaten bitterness he said using a Chinese phrase for enduring hardshipPassengers began handing over Chinese notes worth $750 or $15When they arrived at the tourist center on the border it was time to hand over something else This time it was their cameras which had to be checked for photos deemed undesirable  As the North Koreans were censoring the photos the guides came out with flashy individualized folders featuring pictures of each tourist at the sites they had visited There were photos of them singing with North Korean women at lunch pictures from the museum and snapshots of a chance encounter in a park with a couple on their wedding dayThe tourists were surprised at all of the trouble the North Koreans had gone to and so quickly Many did not have photos of themselves And it was good to help the poor starving North Koreans wasnt it More than half of the tourists handed over $30 for their folder  exorbitant at local pricesTheyre very smart Lin said While our photos were being deleted they were selling us pictures From the first step we took in this land they had planned out exactly how to get our money Congcong Zhang in Sinuiju North Korea contributed to this reportScott Pruitt the head of the Environmental Protection Agency is poised to make wholesale changestothe agencys key advisory group by jettisoning scientists who have received grants from the EPA and replacing them with industry experts and state government officialsThe move represents a fundamental shift one that could change the scientific and technical advice that historically has guided the agency as it crafts environmental regulations The decision to bar any researcher who receives EPA grant money from serving as an adviser appears to be unprecedentedA list of expected appointees to the EPAs Science Advisory Board obtained by The Washington Post from multiple individuals familiar with the appointmentsinclude several categories of experts  voices from regulated industries academics and environmental regulators from conservative states and researchers who have a history of critiquing the science and economics underpinning tighter environmental regulations They would replace a number of scientists who currently have agency grants and whose terms areexpiringThe formal list of appointees is scheduled to be announced TuesdayTerry F Yosie who was the advisory boards director during the Reagan administration said the changes represent a major purge of independent scientists and a decision to sideline the SAB from major EPA decision-making in the futureThe EPA could not immediately be reached for comment but Pruitt suggested in a speech this month at the Heritage Foundation that he planned to rid the agencys scientific advisory boards of researchers with EPA funding He argued that the current structure raises questions about their independence though he did not voice similar objections to industry-funded scientistsWhats most important at the agency is to have scientific advisers that are objective independent-minded providing transparent recommendations Pruitt  If we have individuals who are on those boards sometimes receiving money from the agency    that to me causes questions on the independence and the veracity and the transparency of those recommendations that are coming our wayAmong the likely appointees are sharp proponents of deregulation who have argued both in academic circles and while serving in government that federal regulators need to raise the bar before imposing new burdens on the private sectorJohn D Graham who now serves as dean ofIndiana Universitys School of Public and Environmental Affairs launched a major deregulatory push while head of the Office of Management and Budgets Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under George W Bush He repeatedly informed agencies that they had not sufficiently justified the rules they wanted to enact establishing a process under the Data Quality Act that allowed petitioners to ask agencies to withdraw information that did not meet OMB standards for quality objectivity utility and integrityIn an interview with The Post in 2004 Graham said regulations are a form of unfunded mandate that the federal government imposes on the private sector or on state or local governmentsAnne Smith who serves as managing director of NERA Economic Consulting and co-heads its environmental practice belongs to a firm that has done extensive workfor groups that fought the Obama administrations regulatory agendaIn June President Trump cited a report NERA produced for the American Council for Capital Formation and the US Chamber of Commerce when announcing his decision to exit the international Paris climate agreement The report projected that meeting Americas commitment under the accord would mean as much as 27 million lost jobs by 2025That study was based on several assumptions including the idea that the United States would meet its emissions targets not by maximizing energy efficiency or other low-cost approaches but by forcing the industrial sector to cut emissions by 40 percent between 2005 and 2025 The report did not take into account potential benefits from cutting greenhouse gas emissions or technological advances that could make cutting carbon emissions cheaperAfter Trumps use of these statistics drew criticism NERA issued a statement saying that the 2016 reportstudy was not a cost-benefit analysis of the Paris agreement nor does it purport to be oneAt least three of thelisted appointees have backgrounds working for large corporations whose activities are or could potentially be regulated by the EPA including the French oil giant Total Phillips 66 and Southern Co one the largest US utilitiesOne of them Larry Monroe was previously chief environmental officer at Southern which hasmillions of customers in the Southeast Monroe has particular expertise in how the EPA regulated emissions from coal-fired power plants and criticized the Obama administrations Clean Power Plan which Pruitt is trying to roll backMonroe argued that the plan which was intended to reduce carbon emissions was unworkable and would increase electricity prices to customers while hurting reliabilityIn addition the group of new appointees include those who have like Pruitt battled the EPA in the pastThey include Michael Honeycutt head of the Texas Commission on Environmental Qualitys toxicology division he hasthat the health risks associated with smog are overstated Another expected appointeeisDonald van der Vaart the former secretary of the North CarolinaDepartment of Environmental Quality who has called Obama-era efforts to slash carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and to regulate water quality in the nations rivers and wetlands glaring examples of federal overreachThe move toprohibit anyone receivingEPA grant money from serving on the board has prompted questions and criticism from independent researchers and from some of the agencys current advisers who noted that they follow strict ethics procedures to avoid conflicts of interestRobyn Wilson an Ohio State University professor and an advisory board member who specializes in risk analysis said in an interview Monday that she received a grant this year to work on a project evaluatingthe extent to which federal funds spent on restoring the Great Lakes have made an impact The agency approved a roughly $750000 grant that will be divided among about 10 researchers at three different institutions about $150000 would go to Ohio StateYou want people there with expertise who have experience with the issues EPA is dealing with Wilson said adding that with each assignment board members must go through a pretty elaborate conflict of interest process to make clear that they dont have a stake in the outcomeI just study how farmers make decisions she added Whether EPA regulates something or not that doesnt play into what I doAngela Nugent who previously worked for the EPA as the designated federal officer for the board said that the determination regarding EPA grants would differ from how the agency used to determine when a conflict of interest had occurredIt would be a major departure from current policy to assume that board members have a conflict of interest based on their grants without looking at the actual situation in which they are being asked to do their work and how those grants might affect it she saidIn the past Nugent said the board has required financial disclosures from members in relation to each particular study or project on which they were advisingDeterminations of conflict of interest were then made relating to the specifics of the subject matter conflicts rather than a blanket bar because an individual had an EPA grantCurrent advisory members reached out to Pruitt on Sept 13 formally asking him to meet with them so they could discuss his agenda and their role in advising the agencySuch a meeting would afford you the opportunity to highlight EPA activities and priorities and would allow for a dialogue on how best the SAB can work to ensure the highest quality science supports Agencys policies and decisions wrote board chair Peter Thorne a professor of occupational and

means the collapse of the EU because the EU without France doesnt make any sense he said And it means the collapse of the euro and a financial crisis which will have consequences throughout the

seismic political upheavals it would be foolish towrite her offAs Arauds tenure as Frances representative in the United Statesdraws to an end the 64-year-old can perhaps afford to be outspoken A career diplomat he has spent more than a decade in the US in various posts including a stint as the French ambassador to the United Nations He has watched with interest as his counterpartsin Washington come to grips with the new reality of life under PresidentTrumpThis city was in denial that something was happening said Araud gesturing to the capitals wonks and officialdom This city woke up on the ninth of November and its still under shockTill Nov 8 when I was asked whether our [own] far-right candidate would be elected my answer was no Suddenly I felt that I couldnt have the same answer Araud said He added that Trumps victory signaled that something major was happening in western democracies that Brexit was not an accident that we were facing a global crisis and that the world of our certainties was collapsing (Araud said as much on Twitterat the time provoking enough of a firestorm that he was )Like many other diplomats in Washington Araud says its too early to draw any real conclusions about the shape of US foreign policy under Trump But officialsin European capitals have expressed general alarm over  a vision of the global order that seems a radical rejection of longstanding American policiesMy advice to my authorities is to say try to forget the tweets and wait for the real policy said Araud He stressed that he has not had any hint from the new administration that Frances close relationship to the United States willchangeI personally met Secretary [of Defense James] Mattis and his first sentence to me was that the French were the best allies of the US on the battlefield right now said Araud a reference to French counterterrorism efforts in Syria Iraq and North AfricaMattis Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have all sought to reassure their European counterparts thatAmerican commitments wont change Next weeks visit to Washington by German Chancellor Angela Merkelmay also generate more positive soundbitesI have spent twelve years of my life in [the United States] but I have never felt the sort of paranoid frenzy that I see now on both sides  the sort of take-no-prisoners [approach to politics] and conspiracy theories he said What happened with the election comes on the top of a radicalization process that we are facing everywhere In Europe also our political life is much more radicalized than it was fifteen or twenty years agoWhileAraud is sanguine about the social tensions and economic inequities that have led us to this moment of crisis he also expressed bewildermentwith those in the United States  including   who seem to be cheering the unraveling of the European Union and the wider international liberal orderWhen you talk about the liberal order it isa Western order an American-led order said Araud before embarking on a bit of a history lesson The European Union basically has two godfathers One is the president of the United States and the other one is the pope In the 1950s Washington and the Catholic Church championed European integration as a bulwark against communismSo its a bit paradoxical to see the Americans joining the adversaries of what is an American order he said Thats a bit weirdPresident Trump pledged Friday that his administration remains committed to maintaining the United States long-standing security alliance with Japan aiming to calm jitters in Tokyo over his inflammatory rhetoric on the campaign trailIn a news conference with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the White House Trump called the alliance the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Pacific region and he vowed to make ties between the two countries even closerTrumps remarks on the alliance which hewed closely to statements of previous US presidents would not have been remarkable were it not for  he aimed at Japan during the 2016 presidential campaign He denounced a sizable US trade deficit to Japan and suggested Japan and South Korea were not paying their share to support American troops based in the regionBut the summit aggressively pursued by the Japanese aimed to erase doubts even as the two sides remain at odds over how to move forward on trade and economic tiesTrump sought to present the two countries in close harmony over shared challenges on North Koreas nuclear weapons programs and Chinas aggression in the South China Sea  both of which I consider a very very high priority he saidOn several occasions Trump gave Abe extended handshakes  one in the Oval Office lasted 19 seconds  and patted him on the back displaying a personal warmth that has begun to develop between the two men since Abe became the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his election victory in November Strong hands Trump remarked in the Oval Office mimicking a golf swing The two were scheduled to play a round this weekend at Mar-a-Lago Trumps winter retreat in Palm Beach FlaI grabbed him and hugged him because thats the way we feel Trump said at the news conference describing his greeting of Abe outside the West Wing We have a very very good bond very very good chemistryIll let you know if it changes Trump added drawing laughs in the East Room before adding But I dont think it will  Abe who has made a concerted effort to court Trump since his election praised the presidents outsider candidacy and uphill struggle and fight to win the White HouseThe Japanese leader also pledged that his country would play a greater role in defense and security operations although he was vague on what that might entail Japans Self-Defense Forces are prohibited from combat missions abroad under the constitution imposed on the country by the United States after World War IIOf course there are disagreements Abe said but we should not close down the  dialogue just by pointing to the differences and ignoring the common interests and common goalsThe summit was being watched closely by US allies and partners across the globe for signs over how Trump would deal with a powerful ally after the unpredictable bluster of his campaign and early weeks of his presidency Trump has clashed with the leaders of Mexico and Australia and his move to cancel US participation in a 12-nation Pacific Rim trade pact that includes Japan raised alarms over how he would receive AbeAfter finishing formal talks Trump and Abe left the White House together through the South Lawn entrance and boarded Marine One followed by Trumps daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner a senior adviser to Trump Another Trump adviser Stephen K Bannon also joined them on the presidential helicopter which whisked them past the Washington Monument on a flight path to Joint Base Andrews in Camp Springs Md where Air Force One was waitingThere the two leaders were met by their wives first lady Melania Trump and Akie Abe for the trip to Mar-a-Lago White House officials said Trump plans to use the retreat for diplomatic bonding sessions in the way other presidents have used Camp DavidDuring the news conference Trump was asked about his first phone conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping which had come Thursday evening The White House said Trump reaffirmed his administration would honor Beijings One China policy that stipulates Taiwan is officially part of China despite the island having a separate governmentTrump angered Beijing by receiving a congratulatory phone call from Taiwans president after his election and publicly questioning the One China policy suggesting his administration might renounce it unless China offered better trade deals to the United StatesOn Friday Trump characterized the call with Xi as very very warmI think we are on the process of getting along very well he saidFor his part Abe largely avoided talking in specifics about Trumps decision to break with his predecessor and withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership a 12-nation Pacific Rim free-trade deal that Trump opposed during the campaignBut he did promise that Japan would support Trumps economic growth strategyThere will be even more new jobs born in the US Abe saidTrump promised that the United States would be an even bigger player than it is right now by a lot when it comes to tradeIn a joint statement the two nations said Trump accepted Abes invitation to visit Japan later this yearAnd in another gesture of goodwill Abe made sure to praise Trumps golf gameMy scores in golf are not up to the level of Donald at all Abe said in Japanese according to a translatorIt was not clear however whether Trump understood him the president failed to attach the earpiece of his translation device until after Abes opening statementInvestigators are focusing on a series of meetings held by Jared Kushner President Trumps son-in-law and an influential White House adviser as part of their probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and related matters according to people familiar with the investigationKushner who held meetings in December with the Russian ambassador and a banker from Moscow is being investigated because of the extent and nature of his interactions with the Russians the people saidThe Washington Post reported last week that a senior White House official close to the president was a significant focus of the high-stakes investigation though it did not name KushnerFBI agents also remain keenly interested in former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort but Kushner is the only current White House official known to be considered a key person in the probeThe Post has not been told that Kushner is a target  or the central focus  of the investigation and he has not been accused of any wrongdoing Target is a word that generally refers to someone who is the main suspect of investigators attention though prosecutors can and do bring charges against people who are not marked with that distinctionMr Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry said Jamie Gorelick one of his attorneysIn addition to possible coordination between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election investigators are also looking broadly into possible financial crimes  but the people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly did not specify who or what was being examined  Sarah Isgur Flores a Justice Department spokeswoman said I cant confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of investigations or subjects of investigations The FBI declined to comment At the time of the December meetings Trump already had won the election Contacts between people on the transition team and foreign governments can be routine but the meetings and phone calls with the Russians were not made public at the timeIn early December Kushner met in New York with the Russian ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak and he later sent a deputy to meet with Kislyak Flynn was also present at the early-December meeting and later that month Flynn held a call with Kislyak to discuss US-imposed sanctions against Russia Flynn initially mischaracterized the conversation even to Vice President Pence  ultimately prompting his ouster from the White HouseKushner also met in December with Sergey Gorkov the head of Vnesheconombank which has been the subject of US sanctions following Russias annexation of Crimea and its support of separatists in eastern UkraineIn addition to the December meetings a former senior intelligence official said FBI agents had been looking closely at earlier exchanges between Trump associates and the Russians dating to the spring of 2016 including one at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington Kushner and Kislyak  along with close Trump adviser and current attorney general Jeff Sessions  were present at an  where then-candidate Trump promised in a speech to seek better relations with Russia It is unclear whether Kushner and Kislyak interacted thereThe  that Kushner omitted from security-clearance forms his December meetings with Kislyak and Gorkov though his attorney said that was a mere error and he told the FBI soon after that he would amend the forms The White House said that his meetings were  and inconsequentialKushner has  with the Senate Intelligence Committee which is conducting one of several investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 electionIn many ways Kushner is a unique figure inside the White HouseHe is arguably the presidents most trusted adviser and he is also a close member of the presidents family His list of policy responsibilities is vast  his foreign policy portfolio alone includes Canada and Mexico China and peace in the Middle East  yet he rarely speaks publicly about any of themFormer FBI director Robert S Mueller III is now leading the probe into possible coordination between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign and he has set up shop in the Patrick Henry Building in downtown DC Even before he was picked by Deputy Attorney General Rod J Rosenstein to take over the case investigators had been stepping up their efforts  issuing subpoenas and looking to conduct interviews people familiar with the matter saidA small group of lawmakers known as the Gang of Eight was recently notified of the change in tempo and focus in the investigation at a classified briefingIt is unclear exactly how Muellers leadership will affect the direction of the probe This week Justice Department ethics experts  even though lawyers at his former firm WilmerHale represent several people who could be caught up in the matter including Kushner Manafort and Trumps daughter Ivanka who is married to KushnerMueller resigned from the firm to take over the investigationInvestigators are continuing to look aggressively into the dealings of Flynn and a grand jury in Alexandria Va recently issued a subpoenas for records related to Flynns businesses and finances according to people familiar with the matterFlynns company the Flynn Intel Group was paid more than $500000 by a company owned by a Turkish American businessman close to top Turkish officials for research on Fethullah Gulen a cleric who Turkeys president claims was responsible for a coup attempt last summer Flynn retroactively registered with the Justice Department in March as a paid foreign agent for Turkish interestsSeparately from the probe now run by Mueller Flynn is being investigated by the Pentagons top watchdog for his foreign payments Flynn also received $45000 to appear

that the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil Waronce again thrusting himself into the public spotlight on an emotionally charged issueThe comments made on the debut night of conservative media host Laura Ingrahams show on Fox News came after Kelly was asked about the recent decision by a Virginia church to that honoredthe Confederate general and George WashingtonI would tell you that Robert E Lee was an honorable man Kelly told Ingraham He was a man that gave up his country to fight for his state which 150 years ago was more important than country It was always loyalty to state first back in those days Now its different today But the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War and men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their standThe commentscame in the midst of an interview that touched on a wide range of topics including the indictments in the investigation by special counsel Robert F Mueller the United States relationship with China and Kellys work as the secretary of the Department of Homeland SecurityLong seen as a force of order anddiscipline in the White House the retired Marine generalbecame part of the controversyover the presidents calls to Gold Star families this month when he defended Trumps statements to a widow made about a Florida congresswoman who had criticized the White House

comments as part of a larger point about historyas it is seen througha modern lensI think we make a mistake though and as a society and certainly as as individuals when we take what is today accepted as right and wrong and go back 100 200 300 years or more and say what those you know what Christopher Columbus did was wrong he said You know 500 years later its inconceivable to me that you would take what we think now and apply it back then  The comments quickly touched off a cascade of strong reactionsamong progressives on social media author Ta-Nehisi Coates pointed out that myriad

ActLincolns own platform was a compromise Lincoln was not an abolitionist He proposed to limit slaverys expansion not end itDuring the Civil War Lincoln repeatedly sought to compromise by paying

begun debating how to addressthe Confederate statues that dot the South with many choosing to remove the monuments But the issue has taken an increasingly political turn since Charlottesville emerging asan in the gubernatorial race in VirginiaSome polls have shown that the public is divided about the statues and what they represent About 54 percent of Americans viewed the statues as symbols of Southern pride and not white supremacy  to a poll from the Economist and YouGov in the summerWhile some contend that the Civil War was fought over states rights scholars  that slavery was the primary driver of theconflictWhite House Chief of Staff John F Kelly said Monday he would not apologize for the false attacks he leveled against Rep Frederica S Wilson (D-Fla) this month when he sought to defend President Trump for his handling of a condolence call to the widow of a fallen soldierOn Oct 19 ina rare appearance at the White Housemedia briefing Kelly attacked Wilson as an empty barrel and accused her ofgrandstanding at a public event two years ago in Florida by takingcredit for securing federal funding for a new buildingVideo of the event soon released by the Florida Sun Sentinel showed Wilson did no such thing Rather she used her speech to praise the two slainFBI agents in whose memorythe building was namedWilson accused Kelly of character assassination and members of the Congressional Black Caucus demanded that Kelly apologizeIn an interview to be broadcast Monday night Fox News Channel host Laura Ingraham asked Kelly whether hehad something to apologize forOh no Kelly replied No Never Well Ill apologize if I need to But for something like that absolutely not I stand by my comments  Kelly suggested that he may have been accusing Wilson of grandstanding in a private discussion as opposed to in her public speech although his comment to Ingraham was vagueIll go back and talk about before her comments and at the reception afterwards Kelly said Again it was a package deal Dont want to get into itKelly went on to say that Myeshia Johnson the widow of fallen Sgt La David Johnson has actedwithin her rights to speak out publicly about Trumps handling of his condolence callAs far as the young widow goes she has every right to say what she wants to say Kelly told Ingraham But its the politicization of something that was so from the heartIngrahams interview  one of Kellys rare public appearances  delved into a range of other topics including the removal of Confederate and other historical monuments an issue that has animated Trump in recent monthsIngraham asked Kelly about a historic church in Alexandria Va where former president George Washington worshiped deciding to remove plaques memorializing both Washington and Confederate general Robert E Lee because they were considered intolerant  Well historys history Kelly said And there are certain things in history that were not so good and other things that were very very good I think we make a mistake though and as a society and certainly as individuals when we take what is today accepted as right and wrong and go back 100 200 300 years or more and say what those you know what Christopher Columbus did was wrongKelly added Human history our culture is an evolving thing There will be 100 or 200 years from now people that criticize us for what we do and I guess theyll tear down you know statues of people that we revere today I think its dangerous  I think its just very very dangerous and it shows you what how much of a lack of appreciation of history and what history isTry as he might Jon Stewart just cant stay off television On Tuesday the former Daily Show host once again joined his old friend Stephen Colbert on The Late Show This time Stewart wanted to share

constitutionally partially intact then I Donald J Trump will have demonstrated the greatness of America  just not the way I thought I was gonnaThe acting attorney general informed the Trump White House late last month that she believed Michael Flynn had misled senior administration officials about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States and warned that the national security adviser was potentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail current and former US officials saidThe message delivered by and a senior career national security official to the White House counsel was prompted by concerns that Flynn when asked about his calls and texts with the Russiandiplomat had told Vice President-elect Mike Pence and others that he had not discussed the on Russia for its interference in the 2016 election the officials said It is unclear what the White House counsel Donald McGahn did with the information  night in the wake of revelations about his contacts with the Russian ambassador  In the waning days of the Obama administration James R Clapper Jr who was the director of national intelligence and John Brennan the CIA director at the time shared Yatess concerns and concurred with her recommendation to inform the Trump White House They feared that Flynn had put himself in a compromising position and thought that Pence had a right to know that he had been misled according to one of the officials who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence mattersA senior Trump administration official said before Flynns resignation that the White House was aware of the matter adding that weve been working on this for weeksThe current and former officials said that although they believed that Pence was misled about the contents of Flynns communications with the Russian ambassador they couldnt rule out that Flynn was acting with the knowledge of others in the transitionThe FBI Yates Clapper and Brennan declined to comment on the matter In a Feb8 interview with The Washington Post Flynn categorically denied discussing sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak repeating public assertions made in January by top Trump officials One day after the interview Flynn revised his account telling The Post through a spokesman that he couldnt be certain that the topic never came upTwo officials said a main topic of the relevant call was the sanctions Officials also said there was no evidence that Russia had attempted to exploit the discrepancy between public statements by Trump officials and what Flynn had discussed  Flynn told The Post earlier this month that he first met Kislyak in 2013 when Flynn was director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and made a trip to MoscowUS intelligence reports during the 2016 presidential campaign showed that Kislyak was in touch with Flynn officials said Communications between the two continued after Trumps victory on Nov8 according to officials with access to intelligence reports on the matterKislyak in a brief interview with The Post confirmed having contacts with Flynn before and after the election but he declined to say what was discussedFor Yates and other officials concerns about the communications peaked in the days after the Obama administration on Dec29 announced measures to punish Russia for what it said was the Kremlins interference in the election in an attempt to helpTrumpAfter the sanctions were rolled out the Obama administration braced itself for the Russian retaliation To the surprise of many US officials Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Dec30 that there would be no response Trump praised the decision on TwitterIntelligence analysts began to search for clues that could help explain Putins move The search turned up Kislyaks communications which the FBI routinely monitors and the phone call in question with Flynn   From that call and subsequent intercepts FBI agents wrote a secret report summarizing Flynns discussions with KislyakYates then the deputy attorney general considered Flynns comments in the intercepted call to be highly significant and potentially illegal according to an official familiar with herthinkingYates and other intelligence officials suspected that Flynn could be in violation of an obscure US statute known as the Logan Act which bars US citizens from interfering in diplomatic disputes with another countryAt the same time Yates and other law enforcement officials knew there was little chance of bringing against Flynn a case related to the Logan Act a statute that has never been used in a prosecution In addition to the legal and political hurdles Yates and other officials were aware of an FBI investigation looking at possible contacts between Trump associates and Russia which now included the Flynn-Kislyak communicationsWord of the calls leaked out on Jan12 in  What did Flynn say and did it undercut US sanctions Ignatius wrote citing the Logan ActThe next day a Trump transition official told The Post I can tell you that during his call sanctions were not discussed whatsoeverWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer in a conference call with reporters on Jan13 said that the conversation between Flynn and Kislyak had centeredon the logistics of a post-inauguration call between Trump and Putin That was it plain and simple Spicer addedOn Jan15 Pence was asked about the phone call during  Citing a conversation he had with Flynn Pence said the incoming national security adviser and Kislyak did not discuss anything having to do with the United States decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against RussiaBefore the Pence statement on Jan15 top Justice Department and intelligence officials had discussed whether the incoming Trump White House should be notified about the contents of the Flynn-Kislyak communicationsPences statement on CBS made the issue more urgent current and former officials said because US intelligence agencies had reason to believe that Russia was aware that Flynn and Kislyak had discussed sanctions in their December call contrary to public statementsThe internal debate over how to handle the intelligence on Flynn and Kislyak came to a head on Jan19 Obamas last full day in officeYates Clapper and Brennan argued for briefing the incoming administration so the new president could decide how to deal with the matter The officials discussed options including telling Pence the incoming White House counsel the incoming chief of staff or Trump himselfFBI Director James B Comey initially opposed notification citing concerns that it could complicate the agencys investigationClapper and Brennan left their positions when Trump was sworn in but Yates stayed on as acting attorney general until Jan30 when  for refusing to defend his executive order temporarily barring refugees and people from seven majority-Muslim countries  an action that had been challenged in courtA turning point came after Jan23 when Spicer in his first official media briefing again was asked about Flynns communications with Kislyak Spicer said that he had talked to Flynn about the issue again last night There was just one call Spicer said And it covered four subjects a plane crash that claimed the lives of a Russian military choir Christmas greetings Russian-led talks over the Syrian civil war and the logistics of setting up a call between Putin and Trump Spicer said that was the extent of the conversationYates again raised the issue with Comey who now backed away from his opposition to informing the White House Yates and the senior career national security official spoke to McGahn the White House counsel who didnt respond Monday to a request for comment  his national security adviser after the news brokeOn Monday afternoon Kellyanne Conway counselor to the president said Trump had full confidence in Flynn Minutes later however Spicer delivered a contradictory statement to reportersThe president is evaluating the situation Spicers statement read Hes speaking to Vice President Pence relative to the conversation the vice president had with Gen Flynn and also speaking to various other people about what he considers the single most important subject there is Our national securityAnd then late Monday Flynn resigned Karen DeYoung and Greg Miller contributed to this reportAlternative facts are not facts They are falsehoods Chuck Todd tells Pres Trumps counselor Kellyanne Conway this morning WATCH  Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) If there is one video clip that describes the new reality for the political media  and for the truth  during the President Trump era it is the one aboveIts a discussion about White House press secretary Sean Spicer on his first full day in that job having taken to the podium and  about the size of Trumps inauguration crowdWhy put him out there for the very first time in front of that podium to utter a provable falsehood Chuck Todd  Its a small thing but the first time he confronts the public its a falsehoodAfter some tense back and forth Conway offered thisDont be so overly dramatic about it Chuck Youre saying its a falsehood and theyre giving  our press secretary Sean Spicer gave alternative facts to that But the point really is At this point a visibly exasperated Todd cut in Wait a minute Alternative facts Alternative facts Four of the five facts he uttered  were just not true Alternative facts are not facts theyre falsehoodsFake news is so yesterday Alternative facts is where its at nowThis of course isnt the first time the Trump team and its supporters have responded to journalists calling out their falsehoods by claiming the truth isnt so black and white or that its not a big dealFormer Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski  comparing Trump with a guy at the bar and saying Youre going to say things and sometimes you dont have all the facts to back it upThat same week pro-Trump CNN pundit Scottie Nell Hughes One thing thats been interesting this campaign season to watch is that people that say facts are facts  theyre not really facts Everybody has a way  its kind of like looking at ratings or looking at a glass of half-full water Everybody has a way of interpreting them to be the truth or not trueTheres no such thing unfortunately anymore of factsHughes is not an official spokesman for the Trump team but that last comment is basically what Conway is arguing today  that there are so many shades of gray that clear facts just dont really existThis of course is a hugely cynical worldview But its about the only way the Trump team can fight back given how questionable Whether you like Trump or not its demonstrably true that he says things that are easily proved false over and over again The question the media has regularly confronted is not whether Trumps facts are correct but whether to say hes deliberately lying or notA memo is circulating on social media right now that claims to be from someone who worked in a past White House and tries to explain what the Trump team is doingRe Spicers lies this is from someone who worked in a past administration Important read  Anna Rascout-Paz (@rascouet) Its not clear where this memo came from but no matter the provenance it makes some good points Trump himself has been using his own brand of the truth which is often false for months And there was really no way that his administration wasnt going to have to deal with that same tendency during his presidencyOn Saturday in Spicers statement and now Sunday in Conways interview the two are attempting to set a precedent that says they dont recognize the concept of facts as the media has come to define them they have their own alternative facts and theyll rely on thoseAnd as brazen as it is its likely to appeal to that one-third of Americans the memo describes as being Trumps base Polls have regularly shown a large portion of Republicans are more apt to believe Trumps claims even if they are pretty patently false  Its a symptom of media distrustThe New York Timess Glenn Thrush tweeted this Saturday after Spicers statementPrediction There will be a poll out next week that will show 70-80% of Trump supporters believing that Mall photos were fake news Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) Both fake news and the concept of alternative facts are now cudgels in the effort to obfuscate when reporters point out that Trump and his team have their facts wrong Welcome to our new political reality  or rather realitiesKellyanne Conway thinks she took too much flak for to justify President Trumps travel ban She said she simply  and she later said Except now she doesnt appear to have misspoken at all she seems to have believed that the Bowling Green massacre was a real thingHow do we know Because she cited the same nonexistent attack in separate interviews with two other outlets  Cosmopolitan magazine and TMZWhile discussing why former president Barack Obama halted refugees from Iraq in 2011  He did that because two Iraqi nationals came to this country joined ISIS traveled back to the Middle East to get trained and refine their terrorism skills and come back here and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre of taking innocent soldiers lives awayAnd she echoed those comments when  that same day as  Monday afternoonHe did that because I assume there were two Iraqis who came here got radicalized joined ISIS and then were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green attack on our brave soldiers she saidConways version of events here is a mess The  the two men admitted using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) against US soldiers in Iraq and  attempted to send weapons and money to al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) for the purpose of killing US soldiers The FBI  say the two men traveled back to the Middle East to train for an attack And there was no attack on US soilConways initial quote last week about Bowling Green  with MSNBCs Chris Matthews  was that the Iraqis were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacreAnd  that she meant the men were the masterminds of the  plot which was to send weapons to al-Qaeda in IraqBut masterminds is also a word that generally connotes a complex terrorist act And now we have these new quotesshowing Conway believed this Bowling Green massacre involved overseas training and taking innocent soldiers lives away in Bowling Green KyTrump supporters will dismiss this as quibbling given that the men did target US soldiers in Iraq But Trumps travel ban is aimed at preventing  terrorism of which Bowling Green isnt an example Yet Conway cited it three times as justification and seemed to believe a massacre occurred thereAnd it all goes back to a point I made last week about what this says about the White Houses messaging operation A week after Trumps travel ban was instituted Conway still Perhaps it could be excused as a slip of the tongue But in context its just more evidence of a White House messaging operation that doesnt have its shoes on the right feet Time and again in the last two weeks Trumps top messengers have gotten their facts wrong mixed their messages and struggled to defend their boss There simply doesnt seem to be any planAdd this one to the list  was offered to SOTU on Sunday by the White House We passed Those are the facts CNN Communications

at precisely midnight the veteran actor posted a two-paragraph statement on TwitterIn the first Spacey said he was beyond horrified to hear Rapps story but did not remember the encounter which would have taken placewhen Spacey was 26 However he apologizedif I did behave then as [Rapp] describes  for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behaviorThen in the second paragraph Spacey came

story of survivorship by Anthony Rapp and all those who bravely speak out against unwanted sexual advancesEven worse they said was the implication that the two paragraphs in his statementmight be related in any wayKevin Spacey has set gay rights back fifty yearsby a) conflating homosexuality with Rapps allegations one Twitter user  andb) Saying that being gay is a choice Soon Twitter was flooded with memes from people who were equally dumbfounded and angered by Spaceys approach to the allegationsThe LGBTQ community @ Kevin Spacey today  jess but spoopier (@jesswithsleeves) Kevin

ambitions and suppressed his own people with imprisonment and isolation left in the wake of his death Saturday an antiquated country with a power vacuum  raises immediate questions about the future  and the stability  of perhaps the worlds most isolated state which for six decades has been held together by the Kim family personality cult Kim was deified by state media described as the Dear Leader A weeping television anchor Monday told North Korea of Kims deathSecurity analysts and officials from Seoul to Washington have long believed that Kims death would double as a pivot point on the Korean Peninsula But that poses a threat of its own as North Korea tries to pass power to Kims youngest son  who is in his 20sIn an announcement Monday North Korea called Kim Jong Eun a great successor and urged its people to follow his leadership The state also test-fired two short-range missiles off its east coast according to South Koreas Yonhap News Agency Yonhap quoted an official in Seoul as saying the test most likely was part of a routine drill and was not related to Kim Jong Ils death Until late last year the younger Kim had lived his life almost entirely behind a wall of privacy But as his father struggled with his health he accelerated a controversial  and in late September 2010 named Kim Jong Eun to several top military and political posts This year when the elder Kim made his customary visits to military camps and factories across the country his son often accompanied him  not as an equal but as a traineeOne concern described by numerous Korean security experts is that the younger Kim could face opposition from more senior North Korean officials including Jang Song Thaek who had been acting as a caretaker for the transition In recent years Kim Jong Il tried to minimize the power of other older party members often demoting them  sometimes even banishing them to the countryside  so they wouldnt form allies of their ownSince taking over from his father Kim Il Sung in 1994 Kim kept a tight hold on North Korean society using the juche ideology  emphasizing national self-reliance to rationalize strict crackdowns on political opposition Those who spoke out against the Kim family were sent to prison camps defectors say along with their parents and childrenThe countrys leadership maintained a ban on most communication Most North Koreans even now have no access to the Internet Several hundred thousand North Koreans now have cellphones but they can make only domestic callsAs a result North Korea dealt with almost no dissent  a stark contrast to Arab countries that this year revolted against authoritarian rulers For almost two decades now North Korea has defied predictions of its demise Kims death sparked new concerns that the country could become less stableIn Tokyo Japanese leaders held an emergency security meeting South Koreas Joint Chiefs of Staff put its front-line military on emergency alert with heightened concern about a provocation along the contested maritime border  dipped more than 45 percent amid the news of Kims deathIn recent years particularly since his apparent August 2008 stroke US intelligence agencies had monitored Kims health closely But it was not clear whether they knew his death was imminent Kim took several trips this year to  and Russia traveling by heavily armored trainAnalysts at the CIA and other agencies have warned that his demise could destabilize the country and make it more dangerousThis brings extraordinary change and uncertainty to a country that has seen little change in decades said one US official who spoke on the condition of anonymity South Koreas concern is warranted frankly because an insecure North Korea could well be an even more dangerous North KoreaFor almost two decades South Korea and the United States have discussed contingencies in the event of Kims death  and North Koreas collapse If the Korean Peninsula were to be unified millions of impoverished North Koreans could flood the border into the South The cost of unification according to one major study could exceed $1 trillion and last year President Lee Myung-bak proposed a unification tax  not yet put into place  to prepare for such a momentThe White House issued a statement late Sunday acknowledging Kims death The president has been notified and we are in close touch with our allies in South Korea and Japan We remain committed to stability on the Korean peninsula and to the freedom and security of our alliesSecretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was briefed on the reports of Kims death a department spokesman saidClinton has increased the pressure on the North Korean government in recent weeks traveling to Burma last month in a bid to drive a wedge between Pyongyang and one of its few customers for nuclear technology After the trip there was speculation that she might follow her Burma visit with a trip to the North Korean capital Clinton also appointed a new US envoy last fall to make a new push for a diplomatic breakthrough on North Koreas nuclear program Especially in the past two years North Korea has depended for much of its security on China which supplies Pyongyang with much-needed aid and investment China has also used its influence to block UN measures against North Korea and US officials have called on China to use its influence to encourage North Koreas liberalizationAlmost nothing is known about how Kim Jong Eun if he successfully takes power will run the countryBefore his death Kim Jong Il had been grooming his third and youngest son as his successor Kim Jong Eun studied for a time in Switzerland at a German-speaking high school in Liebefeld a suburb of the Swiss capital Bern Former classmates remember a shy but determined boy obsessed with American basketball and expensive sports shoes They say he spoke passable German and made some local friends but was monitored closely by staff members s from the North Korean Embassy in BernHe vanished in the middle of the school year in 2000 apparently to return to Pyongyang and had not been seen in public since until he emerged at his fathers heir apparent last year A campaign of hagiographic propaganda hailed him as the Dear Young General but it is unclear how much support he has within the armed forces or the ruling party both of which are dominated by far older men His mother a former dancer died in 2004 Staff

disagreement across the political spectrum that major change is needed to kick-start South Koreas anemic economy South Koreans have long bristled at the power of the conglomerates known here as chaebol but have been afraid that change would inflict huge economic pain on the countryThat thinking has shifted during the scandal embroiling the president which centers on allegations that the chaebol particularly Samsung paid bribes to win favorable treatment from the government thereby becoming even more powerfulThis shift means that the main point of difference between presidential candidates is foreign policy and national securityEveryone agrees we need to do something about the chaebol said Shim Jae-hoon a veteran political commentator Its North Korea that will be the deciding factor and that will clinch the presidency in the next election  As did former president Roh rival candidate Moon comes from the progressive camp that favors engagement with Pyongyang as a way to minimize tensions and the economic gap between the two KoreasMoon has said that he would go to Pyongyang if elected president and would seek to reopen the inter-Korean industrial park at Kaesong which Parks government closed saying the money was going into North Koreas weapons programBut An has struck a very different tone South Korea should stand with the international community in imposing sanctions on North Korea to punish the regime for its nuclear belligerence and to keep some leverage over Pyongyang he saidThat stance doesnt however mean hes opposed to talkingI think there should be inter-Korean dialogue but I believe that we need to take our time he told The PostThe onetime activist warns against reading too much into his youthful anti-American protests saying he was a product

people might think Trump is tricky and difficult to deal with but hes a businessman so he could be easier to deal with things could be simpler An saidAn knows that his hopes rest on capturing the middle of the electorate appealing to conservatives who want a hard-line approach to North Korea and would never vote for MoonI think that this is the direction that a progressive party needs to take

looks down then up again with an impish grin Yes I think Im going to win Yoonjung Seo contributed to this reportSpecial counsel Robert S Mueller III on Monday revealed charges against three former Trump campaign officials  including onetime campaign chairman Paul Manafort  marking the first criminal allegations to come from probes into possible Russian influence in US political affairsThe charges are striking for their breadth touching all levels of the Trump campaign and exploring possible personal financial wrongdoing by those involved as well as what appeared to be a concerted effort by one campaign official to arrange a meeting with Russian officials One of the three charged former Trump  admitted to making a false statement to FBI investigators who asked about his contacts with foreigners claiming to have high-level Russian connections Manafort and longtime business partner Rick Gates meanwhile were charged in a 12-count indictment with conspiracy to launder money making false statements and other charges in connection with their work advising a Russia-friendly political party in Ukraine  The investigation which the FBI began last year but escalated significantly with Muellers appointment in May has taken a heavy toll on the Trump administration repeatedly putting the president on the defensive as reports have emerged about the work the special counsels team is doing With Mondays revelations a week that otherwise might have been spent with Washington focused on the Republican tax plan will have talking heads dissecting the criminal counts against former Trump campaign officials  and speculating about the next shoe to drop Papadopouloss plea agreement signed earlier this month and unsealed Monday described his extensive efforts to try to broker connections with Russian officials and arrange a meeting between them and the Trump campaign Emails show that his offers were sometimes looked at warily though more-senior campaign officials at least entertained themManafort and Gates pleaded not guilty in a brief appearance in DC federal court Monday afternoon A federal magistrate judge put the men on home confinement and set a $10 million unsecured bond for Manafort and a $5million unsecured bond for Gates   That means the men would be in debt to the government if they failed to show up for court though they do not have to put any money down Both surrendered their passports to the FBI The next hearing in the case was scheduled for Nov 2 before US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson a 2011 President Barack Obama appointee who previously worked as a federal prosecutor in the DistrictFor their part Trump his spokeswoman and his lawyer sought to cast the charges as having nothing to do with the president White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders asserted that Papadopoulos had an extremely limited volunteer role in the campaign and said that no activity was ever done in an official capacity on behalf of the campaign in that regard Ty Cobb a White House lawyer overseeing the administrations handling of the Mueller probe said The one thing thats clear is theres no reference to collusion no reference to the presidentThe president himself  to declare Sorry but this is years ago before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign But why arent Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus Also there is NO COLLUSION he said in a follow-up  Sanders said that Trump had no intention or plan to make any changes with regard to the special counsel and Cobb said there had been no talk of possible pardons for Manafort or Gates No no no Thats never come up and wont come up Cobb said in an interviewOutside the DC courthouse Kevin Downing a lawyer for Manafort said President Donald Trump was correct There is no evidence that Mr Manafort and the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government Glenn Selig a Gates spokesman said that Gates welcomes the opportunity to confront these charges in courtThis fight is just beginning Selig said   The charges are a major step in the investigation but they do not represent a conclusion Court documents revealed that Papadopoulos for example has been cooperating with investigators for three months  having been arrested and charged in July after landing at Dulles International Airport on a flight from Germany The information he provides could be key to furthering Muellers investigation into others legal analysts said Papadopoulos admitted that he had lied to the FBI about his interactions with people he thought had connections with the Russian government  essentially understating the conversations and claiming falsely that they had occurred before he joined Trumps campaign In a January 2017 interview with the FBI Papadopoulos told agents that a London-based professor claimed to him that he had dirt on Hillary Clinton including thousands of emails But Papadopoulos said that initially he viewed the professor as a nothing In reality according to his plea Papadopoulos understood that the professor had connections to Russian government officials and he treated him seriously An email quoted in court filings appears to match one  in which Papadopoulos identified the professor with whom he met as Joseph Mifsud the director of the London Academy of Diplomacy After a March 2016 meeting with the professor who was not identified in court records Papadopoulos emailed a campaign supervisor and other members of the campaigns foreign policy team He claimed that the professor had introduced him to Putins niece and the Russian ambassador in London and that the purpose was to arrange a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss US-Russia ties under President Trump court documents say   The government noted that the woman was not Russian President Vladimir Putins niece and while Papadopoulos expected the professor to introduce him to the Russian ambassador that never happened But in the months that followed Papadopoulos continued to correspond with the woman and the professor about a meeting between the Trump campaign possibly including Trump himself and Russian officialsThe Russian government has an open invitation by Putin for Mr Trump to meet him when he is ready Papadopoulos wrote to a senior policy adviser for the campaign on April 25At one point a campaign official forwarded one of Papadopouloss emails to another campaign official saying We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal DT would appear to be a reference to Donald Trump  Papadopouloss effort continued into the summer of 2016 and in August 2016 a campaign supervisor told Papadopoulos and another foreign policy adviser that they should meet with Russian officials That ultimately did not take place according to the pleaAccording to documents and interviews the supervisor was national campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis whose lawyer said he actually opposed the trip and was just being polite Other officials who received emails from Papadopoulos were campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and ManafortLawyers for Papadopoulos said in a statement We will have the opportunity to comment on Georges involvement when called upon by the Court at a later date We look forward to telling all of the details of Georges story at that timeIn a separate indictment the special counsel alleged that Manafort and Gates laundered money for nearly a decade through scores of US and foreign corporations and accounts and gave false statements to the Justice Department and others when asked about their work on behalf of a foreign entity The time period stretched into at least 2016 though it did not seem to involve the Trump campaign  According to the indictment Manafort and Gates arranged to hire two Washington-based lobbying firms to work on behalf of their Ukrainian clients arranging meetings with US officials and boosting their public image in the United States Though it was not named one of the firms referenced in the indictment is the Podesta Group Tony Podesta the head of the firm  The other firm is Mercury Public Affairs according to people familiar with the matter A partner at Mercury said the firm believed our work was intended to serve an important and proper purposeProsecutors say Manafort and Gates arranged for a Brussels-based nonprofit to nominally hire the Washington companies to hide the fact that the two men were working for Ukrainian government officials otherwise they would have been required to register under the Foreign Agents Registration ActIn fact prosecutors allege Manafort was communicating directly with then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych about the effort promising in 2012 to provide him weekly updates Prosecutors say that when the Justice Department approached Manafort and Gates in 2016 and 2017 about whether they should have registered as foreign agents for the work they responded with false and misleading letters according to the indictmentManafort and Gates also were accused of trying to hide money kept in foreign bank accounts  Manafort from 2011 to 2014 and Gates from 2012 to 2014 And Manafort was accused of filing fraudulent tax returns stating on tax forms he filed from 2008 to 2014 that he controlled no foreign bank accountsAll told more than $75 million flowed through offshore accounts the special counsel alleged    From 2008 to 2014 according to the indictment Manafort arranged to wire $12 million from offshore accounts to pay for personal expenses including $5 million to a home renovation contractor in the Hamptons more than $13 million to a home entertainment and lighting vendor based in Florida $934000 to an antique-rug dealer in Alexandria and $849000 to a mens clothier in New YorkLaw enforcements interest in Manafort dates back to at least 2014 according to a person familiar with the case While Muellers probe has focused on Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn investigators have shown interest in a broad array of other topicsThose include meetings that the presidents son-in-law  had with the Russian ambassador and a banker from Moscow in December and  at Trump Tower involving the presidents son Donald Jr and a Russian lawyer Muellers team has requested extensive records from the White House covering areas including the presidents private discussions about firing James B Comey as FBI director and his response to news that Flynn was under investigation according to two people briefed on

the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said when asked about PapadopoulosHe does ring a very faint bell but hes not written anything very significant on East Mediterranean natural gas and pipelines that I can rememberIndeed Papadopoulos has not left much of a paper trail He has written an oped piece in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz and three articles for Arutz Sheva an Israeli news site He has given an interview on another Web siteHis points in all of them boil down to this Israel should use the natural gas it has found in the giant Leviathan field offshore in the eastern Mediterranean to build bridges to Greece and Cyprus  and avoid dealing with Turkey at all costs Any extra gas could be sent to Egypt which Papadopoulos said already has liquefied natural gas plants for importing gasHe also  Israel to settle antitrust issues regarding its oil and gas industry  by providing the regulatory certainty  so that relatively large companies can exploit the natural gas soonPapadopoulos who bears the same name as the Greek colonel who led a 1967 coup has also written the United States should station a fleet of warships in Crete and that Cyprus should join NATOShipping the natural gas to Turkey by pipeline and from there to the rest of Europe might be relatively inexpensive Papadopoulos has written but he said Israel should look elsewhere The Turkish option he  in March 2014 is bereft of the political realities in the region and does not take into account the potentially devastating impact this option can have on Israels strategic relations with EU member Cyprus and by extension all of Europe He writes Regional economic cooperation between Israel and Cyprus should be the guiding principle that anchors Israel economically to EuropeIn October 2015 he  in Haaretz that Israels

EuropeThe United States andIsrael are allies butwhose team is he onPapadopoulos also wrote in January 2014 that Israel and Greeces robust military relations have redrawn the political map of the

power as she argued at the time similar aggressive policies of pushing NATO right to Russias doorstep have instigated todays predicamentMichael Flynn the national security adviser to President Trump resigned late Monday over revelations about his  to the United States and his misleading statements about the matter to senior Trump administration officialsFlynn stepped down amid mounting pressure on the Trump administration to account for its false statements about Flynns conduct after The Washington Post reported Monday that the Justice Department had warned the White House last month that Flynn had so mischaracterized his communications with the Russian diplomat that he might be vulnerable to blackmail by Moscow  In his Flynn said he had inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador I have sincerely apologized to the president and the vice presidentFlynn was referring to his disproven claims to Vice President Pence and others a month ago that he had never discussed US sanctions against Moscow with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak Pence White House spokesman Sean Spicer and others relying on Flynns accounts publicly defended him and repeatedly declared in categorical terms that sanctions were never discussedPresident Trump accepted Flynns resignation letter and appointed Keith Kellogg a decorated retired Army lieutenant general as acting national security adviserFlynns resignation  after just 24 days on the job  caps a decorated career in public service for the retired lieutenant general and intelligence officialKellogg is one of three candidates Trump is considering as a permanent replacement for Flynn according to a senior White House official The other two are David H Petraeus a former CIA director and retired general and  a former deputy commander of the US Central CommandOne senior White House official said that Trump did not fire Flynn rather Flynn made the decision to resign on his own late Monday evening because of what this official said was the cumulative effect of damaging news coverage about his conversations with the Russian envoy  This official who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the situation said Trump does not relish firing people  despite his television persona on The Apprentice  and had intended to wait several more days before deciding whether to seek Flynns resignationThere obviously were a lot of issues but the president was hanging in there this official said Flynns departure just weeks into the Trump administration compounds the confusion in the National Security Council that is supposed to serve as a disciplined coordination center for the administrations handling of international affairsInstead the White House faces an escalating court fight over an immigration ban aimed at Muslim-majority countries has alienated key allies with Trumps brusque phone calls to foreign leaders and seemed so caught off-guard by North Koreas  that Trump and senior officials were shown  in full view of patrons at Trumps Mar-a Lago resort Flynn was forced out less than a week after it was disclosed that he had discussed US sanctions against Russia with that countrys ambassador before Trump was sworn in as presidentBut Flynns undoing was more directly tied to his inaccurate accounts of those contacts to senior Trump officials including Pence who officials said was incensed to learn that Flynn has not told him the truth  Flynn again denied that he had discussed the subject in an interview with The Washington Post last week only to back away from that statement a day later by acknowledging through a spokesman that while he couldnt recall speaking about sanctions he could not rule it outIn fact US intelligence and law enforcement officials have said that sanctions were a main subject of Flynns conversation with Kislyak on the day that the Obama administration announced a series of punitive measures aimed at punishing Moscow for its meddling in the 2016 US presidential electionUS officials said that Flynn told Kislyak that Moscow should not overreact to the sanctions indicating that the two sides would soon be in position to revisit the matter presumably in Moscows favorIn conveying that message Flynn may have broken a law against unauthorized individuals negotiating with foreign governments over conflicts He is unlikely to face legal sanction however because that law dates to 1799 and has never been used in a prosecutionBut Flynns departure is unlikely to end the trouble the issue has created for the Trump administration The Post reported Monday that then-acting US attorney general Sally Q Yates told the White House counsel last month that Flynns misleading statements to Pence and others  whose own government would have known that sanctions were discussedThe White House appears to have let its repeated false statements about Flynn stand for weeks after that notification from Yates and has yet to account for what it did with the warning she conveyed The disclosures about Flynn have added to the swirling suspicion about the Trump administrations relationship with Moscow  suspicion based in part on Trumps repeated expressions of Flynns resignation appears to end the career of a highly decorated US military intelligence officer who served repeated tours in Afghanistan and Iraq but became a polarizing figure in last years presidential campaignIn a speech at the Republican National Convention Flynn led vitriolic attacks on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton leading chants of Lock her up and declaring that if he had been even partly as careless as she was in her handling of sensitive material by email he would be in jail  Flynn spent last weekend at Mar-a-Lago with Trump staffing the president during his visit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Back at the White House on Monday Flynn attended classified briefings helped orchestrate the visit of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and led Trumps morning intelligence briefing this official saidSome of Trumps political advisers felt Flynn should not be fired in the midst of intense media scrutiny and calls for his resignation from Democratic opponentsPart of me said nobody should be firing this guy  not on the day that Nancy Pelosi said fire this guy the official said  But by Monday evening Flynn had decided he could not surviveIt was when you feel like youre looking around the room and asking Wheres my friend the White House official said The Pence thing was huge He is not somebody whos quick to anger That was very telling to everybodyFlynn presented his resignation letter to Trump roughly around 9 pm shortly after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchins swearing-in ceremony in the Oval Office Trump accepted the letterIt was a sad moment the White House official saidIt took Stephen Colbert and Joe Scarborough all of two minutes to get to Kellyanne Conway and the L-wordScarborough was a guest Tuesday night on Colberts Late Show and he seemed eager to explain the decision to last weekIt got to a point where Kellyanne would keep coming out and everything she said was disproven like five minutes later Scarborough said And it wasnt disproven by a fact-checker  it was somebody else in the administration that would come out and actually say well actually no thats not trueTheres a quicker way to say that entire sentence Colbert replied She just liedScarborough a former Republican congressman from Florida is the host of Morning Joe Co-host Mika Brzezinski said earlier this month that Conway tries to book herself on the show but I wont do it cause I dont believe in fake news or information that is not true  Every time Ive seen her on television somethings askew off or incorrect  Conway was the person who ushered the phrase alternative facts into the popular American lexicon It was January on Meet the Press and host Chuck Todd was pressing her on why the White House press secretary made easily disproved claims about the size of Trumps inauguration crowdConway told Todd that White House press secretary Sean Spicer had alternative factsAlternative facts are not facts Todd responded Theyre falsehoodsThe statement  and Conways credibility took a hitTim OBrien (@obrienillustration Instagram) has created perhaps the ultimate visual on    Andy Revkin (@Revkin) It got worse a few days later when Conwayused the Bowling Green massacre in justifying Trumps travel ban saying most people dont know about it because it didnt get coveredIt also didnt happen There has  by terrorists or anyone elseConway said shed misspoken but The Washington Posts Aaron Blake reported that On    I meant to say Bowling Green terrorists as reported here  Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) As The Posts  the Morning Joe hosts have characterized Conway as an attention seeker who texts TV producers in a constant effort to get on air so she can speak for a White House where she actually isnt in the knowBorchers wrote that the morning show hosts described Conway as pretty much like her caricature on Saturday Night LiveScarborough also used his time on the show to talk about Conways boss the president who they think based on his Twitter feed is an avid watcher Hes watched the show for years kind of goes in waves  Well always look in the camera and say Donald we know youre not watching the show but how you doingColbert pushed back jesting about calling Trump Donald instead of Mr PresidentThe way hes acted over the past month has

pouring it on Last week he  He has made fun of Trump calling the media  and he hasA little-noticed court filing unsealed this week as part of special counsel Robert S Mueller IIIs ongoing probe could have big consequences for his other targets  showing hes willing to use suspects lawyers to provide evidence against themAfter unsealing a 12-count indictment against  Paul Manafort the US District Court also unsealed an opinion from Chief Judge Beryl A Howell saying one of Manaforts former lawyers could be compelled to testify to the grand juryTypically such information is protected by attorney-client privilege  a bedrock principle of US legal practice that says a lawyer must keep confidential what they are told by their clientsThere are some exceptions to that confidentiality including in instances where a suspect may have lied to his or her lawyer causing that lawyer to unwittingly lie to the government Howell ruled that in Manaforts case the exception applied and the attorney could be called to testify before the grand juryThe opinion is troubling because people make representations to the government all the time through their lawyers and I think theres a general expectation of confidentiality behind the conversations that go into those representations said Peter D Hardy a partner at the Ballard Spahr law firm Its widening a door thats not often used And the wider the door gets maybe the more people will use it  Hardy said the use of what lawyers call the crime-fraud exception indicates the special counsel team is highly intelligent highly aggressive and theyre going to pursue legal theories that your average prosecutor will not use Will they use the specific theory again Its certainly possibleManafort is hardly the only person under scrutiny who used lawyers to make government filings One of Muellers other key targets Michael Flynn has also filed government papers regarding his work on behalf of another governmentNo public charges have been filed against Flynn former national security adviser in the Trump administration but he remains under investigation according to officials familiar with the matter who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigationIn the Manafort case the judge began her ruling by declaring This is a matter of national importance The ruling does not identify Manaforts lawyer  it refers to the attorney simply as the Witness but people familiar with the case said it was Melissa Laurenza who was willing to testify if her clients consented which they did not Neither Laurenza nor her lawyer responded to a request for comment TuesdayA Manafort spokesman also declined to commentAfter several hearings on the subject the judge decided prosecutors could ask the lawyer seven out of eight proposed questions ruling one went too far The judge said investigators had gathered enough evidence from other sources to justify questioning the lawyer though the details of that evidence were redacted from the court filingThat legal fight took place under seal in September but the opinion was unsealed Monday the same day charges were announced against Manafort and his deputy Rick GatesProsecutors also revealed Monday that a  had pleaded guilty and been cooperating with investigators for monthsIn Manaforts case prosecutors used information from his former lawyer to charge him with lying to the government about his work for a foreign government  Ukraine While most of the indictment focuses on issues of alleged money laundering conspiracy and failure to file reports to tax authorities the last two counts of the indictment say that Manafort and Gates knowingly and willfully caused to be made a false statement in a government filing required under the Foreign Agents Registration Act or FARA  Court filings suggest those two charges stem in part from information provided by Manaforts former lawyerIn the FARA filing Manafort and Gates denied that their work on the part of Ukraines Party of Regions constituted lobbying on behalf of a foreign governmentJacob Frenkel a white-collar attorney at Dickinson Wright who previously worked in the Office of the Independent Counsel said Howells ruling was likely a critical one for prosecutors  who otherwise would need to jump over and avoid altogether the communications with counselIt is invaluable to the FARA counts and to the issue of Manaforts state of mind more broadly in the indictment because an experienced credible lawyer is going to have instant credibility with a jury Frenkel saidFrenkel said that the ruling was written in such a way that Howell seemed to believe it would be appealedThe attorneys testimony will be central to an actual case if this case ever gets there Frenkel saidWith the guilty plea of one Trump campaign official and a 31-page indictment of two others special counsel Robert S Mueller III spoke volumes more about the Russia probe than months of heated public debate Without uttering a word Muellers message was clear according to veteran lawyers He isnt bluffing and witnesses are talkingThe double-barreled court filings ratchet up the pressure on everyone under scrutiny in the investigation lawyers said in part because they show that a former Trump campaign adviser began cooperating with the FBI three months ago This is the way you kick off a big case said Patrick Cotter a white-collar defense lawyer in Chicago who once worked as a federal prosecutor in New York alongside Andrew Weissmann who is spearheading the prosecution of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates Prosecutors also announced a guilty plea from former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos about his interactions with people linked to the Russian government Papadopoulos has  who questioned him about those contacts according to court recordsOh man they couldnt have sent a message any clearer if theyd rented a revolving neon sign in Times Square Cotter said And the message isnt just about Manafort Its a message to the next five guys they talk to And the message is We are coming and we are not playing and we are not bluffingThe special counsel also appears to be moving fastWhite-collar cases often begin by flipping bit players far down the chain of command The prosecution team that sent WorldCom chief executive Bernie Ebbers to prison for decades began with charges against a low-level accountant Prosecutors then worked their way up the corporate ladder flipping senior managers until they had a case against EbbersAnd as Mueller probes whether Trump associates conspired with Russian government actors to influence the 2016 presidential election he already has a cooperator at the lower rungs of the campaign Papadopoulos The prosecutors court filings say that Papadopoulos sought to arrange a meeting between officials with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and talked to people connected to the Russian government about providing dirt on Democratic candidate Hillary ClintonPeter Zeidenberg a former federal prosecutor with expertise in national security called the Papadopoulos plea a big deal because it goes much closer to the issue of collusionThe fact that hes been cooperating for three months is important too he said Who else is cooperating that we dont know about Thats what people in the White House need to be worried aboutWhile the Papadopoulos court filings offer more links between Trump associates and Russian figures they do not define the extent to which senior campaign officials supported that effortIts not a direct connection as yet said Daniel E Toomey a former prosecutor in Washington There are additional bread crumbs that are missing leading to the White HouseToomey called the indictment of Manafort and Gates extraordinarily intricate and said it will put enormous pressure on the defendants to cooperate   This becomes a paper case The documents speak for themselves he said This case by my estimation will take months to try The cost of the litigation for Manafort will be in the millions of dollars Veteran lawyers described the indictment as daunting  alleging $18 million worth of money laundering which prosecutors said in court could mean more than a dozen years in prisonThe indictment even seems to go out of its way to kneecap a standard defense argument in such cases  that the defendant got bad advice from his accountant The indictment charges that Manafort wrote specifically to his accountant that he did not have foreign bank accounts  Nick Akerman a former assistant special Watergate prosecutor said the court filings all spell bad news for President TrumpAkerman said he could not see any defense to the Manafort indictmentHe has no choice but to plead guilty Thats what the indictment says to me he said The only defense that youve got is to go in there and start singing like a canary to avoid jail time And once he starts singing one of the tunes is bound to be Donald Trump But Jay Nanavati a former Justice Department tax prosecutor said the filing of the indictment shows that so far prosecutors have not been able to convince Manafort to cooperate but this is still how you start moving up the ladder in any organizationWhats striking about the indictment Nanavati said is the number of people who worked for Manafort  accountants lawyers and others  who provided key evidence against him That could be an ominous warning for other subjects of the probe like former national security adviser Michael Flynn who used lawyers to make official statements to the government that have now come into question And unidentified lobbying firms indirectly hired by Manafort he said are in significant trouble because of the written exchanges referenced in the indictment alleging that some people at the firms were aware that Manafort was lying about their work togetherNanavati said a key change in US tax enforcement that began in 2008  going after foreign bank accounts controlled by Americans  probably played an important role in the case against Manafort Before the Justice Department started cracking through the layers of Swiss banking secrecy that hid Americans accounts in 2008 he said the requirement on Americans to declare foreign bank accounts was on the books but basically nobody ever did it and almost no one ever got prosecuted for it That changed in 2008 and tax return preparers started asking With the decline of bank secrecy Nanavati said crimes such as tax evasion and money laundering through foreign accounts became harder to hide and made the charges against Manafort easier to bringA key leader of the tax enforcement effort was then-Justice Department lawyer Kevin DowningDowning is now Manaforts defense lawyer Outside court on Monday he blasted the governments indictment for claiming his client committed crimes via foreign bank accounts To claim that maintaining such accounts to bring all your funds into the United States as a scheme to conceal from the United States government is ridiculous Downing saidTaking off his glasses and affecting a somber tone Stephen Colbert

high-profile federal prosecutors in the country said he was fired Saturday after refusing to submit a letter of resignation as part of an ouster of the remaining US attorneys who were holdovers from the Obama administration according to people familiar with the matterBhararas dismissal was an about-face from President Trumps assurances to the Manhattan-based prosecutor in November weeks after the election that he wanted him to stay on the job following a meeting at Trump Tower according to BhararaTwo people close to Trump said the presidents chief strategist Stephen K Bannon and Attorney General Jeff Sessions wanted a clean slate of federal prosecutors and were unconcerned about any perception that the White House changed its mind about Bharara The removal of former president Barack Obamas federal prosecutors is about asserting whos in power the two saidThe departure of Bharara the US attorney for the Southern District of New York capped a confusing sequence of events beginning Friday when acting deputy attorney general Dana Boente began making calls to 46 prosecutors asking for their resignations by the end of the day Requests for resignation are a normal part of a transition of power from one administration to another although both the Bush and Obama administrations let their US attorneys leave gradually  During Fridays call with Bharara the New York prosecutor asked for clarity about whether the requests for resignations applied to him given his previous conversation with Trump and did not immediately get a definitive answer according to a person familiar with the exchangeWhen asked Friday whether Bharara was also being asked for a resignation letter one White House official not authorized to speak publicly said Everybodys gone and would not engage further on the issueOn Saturday morning when the administration had still not received Bhararas resignation Boente attempted to call the US attorney to find out why but the two men did not immediately connect according to people familiar with the discussionsWhen they finally did speak shortly before 230 pm Boente informed Bharara that the order to submit his resignation indeed applied to him because he was a presidentially appointed US attorney according to a Justice Department official with knowledge of the conversationBharara asked Boente if he was firing him and Boente replied that he was asking him to submit his resignation the official saidMinutes later Bharara announced on Twitter that he was out I did not resign Bharara said Moments ago I was fired Being the US Attorney in SDNY will forever be the greatest honor of my professional lifeBharara sent an email to his staff asserting again that Boente had removed him from his jobNeedless to say it is personally very sad for me the note said This is the greatest place on Earth and I love you all Even on a day when your US Attorney gets fired it is still Thanksgiving because you all still get to do the most honorable work there is to doBharara added that the office could not be in better hands than with the deputy US attorney for the Southern District of New York Joon H Kim whom he called a tremendous leader and public servant and who loves the office just as much as I doWithin the Justice Department some are questioning whether a recent phone call from Trump to Bharara may have contributed to the decision to remove the Obama holdovers according to a person familiar with the matterOn Thursday a White House aide called and left a message for Bharara saying the president wanted to speak with him though the prospective topic of discussion was unclear Bharara consulted his staff and determined that it would probably be a violation of Justice Department protocols for him to speak directly to the president this person said That protocol exists in order to prevent political interference  or the appearance of political interference  with Justice Department workBharara then contacted the chief of staff for the attorney general Jody Hunt told him of his own determination and the two agreed that it would be a violation of the Justice Department protocol for Bharara to call the president back Bharara then called the White House staffer who had left the message and said he wouldnt be talking to the president and explained why this person said Its unclear whether the Trump call and its aftermath had anything to do with Fridays decision Bharara who was born in India and came to the United States as a child had a particularly powerful perch in the criminal justice system The Southern District of New York has 220 assistant US attorneys making it one of the largest federal prosecutors offices in the countryDuring his tenure Bharara indicted 17 prominent New York politicians for malfeasance  10of them Democrats Along with his bipartisan prosecutions Bharara developed a reputation for being tough on insider trading although he was criticized for the lack of prosecutions that followed the financial crisisBharara was an outspoken man in a job that has been held by vocal and politically aspirant predecessors including former New York mayor Rudolph W Giuliani and FBI Director James B ComeyThere is no indication that the ouster of Bharara stems from a disagreement about a particular case or investigation While the FBI has been conducting a counterintelligence inquiry looking for evidence of contacts between agents of the Russian government and Trump campaign advisers and a former campaign adviser to Trump has been part of an investigation into possible overseas corruption there have been no signs that Bhararas office has been involved in either of those probes or any other inquiries that might touch on the president or people close to him  On Wednesday watchdog groups  Bharara to probe whether Trump has received payments or other benefits from foreign governments through his business interests in violation of the Constitutions emoluments clause which prohibits top officials from receiving favors or payments from foreign governmentsThe president complained on Twitter earlier this month that Obama had ordered wiretapping of Trump Tower during the election season  an accusation that multiple federal law enforcement officials have said is untrue  partly because presidents cannot order the FBI to wiretap Americans and also because no such surveillance was undertaken But Bharara was not drawn into that debate which principally revolved around the Justice Department and FBI headquartersInitially after Trump won the presidency it looked as if Bhararas position was safe Trump brought up Bhararas name in November during a phone conversation with Sen Charles E Schumer (D-NY) whom the president-elect was calling to congratulate on becoming the leader of the Senate Democrats according to people familiar with the matter In that conversation Trump said he was thinking of keeping Bharara in his job these people said Schumer praised Bharara and Trump then arranged a meeting with Bharara at Trump TowerDuring the conversation Trump told Bharara to call Sessions his nominee for attorney general who also asked Bharara to stay people familiar with the conversation saidWhen Bharara was leaving according to one person he asked the president-elect what he should tell the reporters in the lobby Trump told Bharara to tell them he was staying on this person saidBharara told reporters afterward that the president-elect presumably because hes a New Yorker and is aware of the great work that our office has done over the past seven years asked to meet with him and discuss whether he would remain in his positionWe had a good meeting Bharara said I agreed to stay on Matt Zapotosky Rosalind S Helderman Cleve R Wootson Jr Amy B Wang and Ellen Nakashima contributed to this reportA newly disclosed email sent on the morning of a Trump Tower meeting held during last years presidential campaign between Donald Trump Jr and a Russian lawyer raises new questions about how the key session came togetherThe note was written by the Russian lawyer and sent to a music promoter who had helped arrange the sessionIt could offer evidence backing up the Russian lawyers claims that she was meeting with Trump Jr solely to discuss a 2012 law despised by the Kremlin that imposed financial sanctions on wealthy Russians as punishment for human rights abusesThat is the version of events the lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya has asserted in media interviews since the New York Times first disclosed the Trump Tower meeting in JulyBut her version conflicts with explosive correspondence released previously that shows the music promoter told Trump Jr before the meeting that Veselnitskaya would bring damaging information about Hillary Clinton on behalf of the Russian government to help the Trump campaignThe newly disclosed email was provided to The Washington Post by Scott Balber a US lawyer representing Aras Agalarov the Russian billionaire who hosted the Trump-owned Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013 and who had helped secure the Trump Tower meeting for VeselnitskayaBalber said he was releasing the email from Veselnitskaya because he thinks it bolsters his clients claim that the Trump Tower meeting was not part of a Russian government effort to assist President Trumps campaign despite what music publicist Rob Goldstone had writtenThe newly disclosed email shows Veselnitskaya wrote Goldstone on the morning of the scheduled meeting to ask whether she could bring a lobbyist and trusted associateThe lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin is working to advance these issues with several congressmen she continued He has invaluable knowledge about the positions held by the members of the Foreign Relations Committee that will be important to our discussionAt the time Veselnitskaya was preparing to testify before the congressional committee about the law the Magnitsky ActThe email offers no conclusive evidence about why Trump Jr accepted the meeting with Russians as his father prepared to accept the Republican nomination for president Trump Jr had reacted enthusiastically when told over email by Goldstone that Agalarov had met with a top prosecutor in Russia and been provided incriminating information about Clinton that the Russian lawyer would conveyIf its what you say I love it Trump Jr wroteBalbers clients also include Agalarovs pop star son Emin who is represented by Goldstone and asked Goldstone to set up a meeting He also represents Ike Kaveladze a US-based employee of the Agalarovs Agalarov denies that he met with a Russian prosecutor about the US presidential campaign as Goldstone wroteBalber said Veselnitskaya provided him with the email during an interview in Moscow last month which he conducted to better understand how the Trump Tower meeting came together by speaking to the person who had first requested itMy clients have been implicated in my view unfairly in some theory that they were involved in an effort to influence the election campaign by providing some secret damaging information about Hillary Clinton he said The documents he said are consistent with what my clients have saidVeselnitskaya did not respond to a request for commentBalber said Veselnitskaya also provided him a detailed account of how she secured the meetingHer account began when she was extended an offer to testify at a June 14 2016 congressional hearing about the Magnitsky Act by US Rep Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif) an advocate of closer ties with Russia The Post has reported that her testimony was ultimately scuttled after opposition from Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Edward R Royce (R-Calif)Veselnitskaya has said she was interested in the Magnitsky Act issue on behalf of a private client She was working closely in the United States with Akhmetshin a Russian American lobbyist who has been accused of having ties to Russian intelligence He has denied ties to the Russian governmentVeselnitskaya told Balber that she met with a series of well-connected Russians in early June 2016 to discuss her upcoming trip to the United States One person with whom she met was Agalarov for whom she had previously done legal workVeselnitskaya told Balber she did not seek a meeting with the Trump campaign but was surprised and pleased when Agalarov explained his business connection to the presidential candidate and offered to make a connection Veselnitskaya told Agalarov that she had in October 2015 provided information intended to undermine the US law to Yuri Chaika the Russian prosecutor general Balber said Balber said he believes it is possible Veselnitskayas statement resulted in a misunderstanding about the prosecutors roleRobert Gage an attorney for Goldstone declined to commentBy June 7 2016 Goldstone had confirmed that Veselnitskaya and her translator were confirmed to meet with the candidates son along with top campaign aide Paul Manafort and Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner Two days later Veselnitskaya sent the email asking if she could bring AkhmetshinAkhmetshin has previously told The Post that he was invited to the meeting at the last minute after having lunch in New York City with Veselnitskaya where she asked his advice on what to say The newly released email shows Veselnitskaya asked Goldstone if the lobbyist could attend at 924 am not after lunch and that she wrote she had a signed a nondisclosure agreement with AkhmetshinMichael Tremonte a lawyer for Akhmetshin said that the lobbyist was invited to the meeting over lunchHe has no recollection of signing a nondisclosure agreement in connection with the meeting and was not aware of the communications between Ms Veselnitskaya and Mr Goldstone Tremonte said Natasha Abbakumova Andrew Roth and

has announced its first five-year plan since the 1980s with leader Kim Jong Un issuing instructions for developing the Korean revolution on a higher stageThe prominence put on the economy at the first  to be held in 36 years underscores the emphasis that Kim the third-generation leader of North Korea has placed on improving living standards and at the same time pursuing nuclear weapons But it is something of a risky move for Kim because he could be held accountable for itAlso at the congress which got underway Friday Kim said North Korea would not use its nuclear weapons unless its sovereignty was violated a familiar refrain from Pyongyang which presents its nuclear and missile program as necessary for self-defense Kim has lauded North Koreas advances in nuclear technology as South Korean officials continue to warn that a fifth test could be imminentThe surprisingly full remarks from Kim were reported on North Koreas state television and in the official media Sunday Foreign journalists allowed to travel to Pyongyang for the congress have not been given any access to the forum apart from being taken to a street corner across from the venueThe agenda for the congress includes a review of the partys work and rules the election of Kim to the top position in the party and the filling of other senior positions according to the Norths official Korean Central

year after nuclear and ballistic missile tests are expected to create additional challenges  Michael Madden who runs the  site said the plan is a big deal because Kim is taking public responsibility for economic development something his father never didIt has appeared that Kim has been trying to rule like his grandfather Kim Il Sung who placed more importance on the Workers Party than on the military His father and predecessor Kim Jong Il promoted a military first policyThe announcement of a five-year economic plan slightly proves the hypothesis that Kim Jong Un is ruling like his grandfather  he even appropriated a Kim Il Sung policy direction here  with more formal lines of control and authority like a five-year economic plan Madden saidIn an address at the congress Kim announced a five-year strategy for the state economic development from 2016 to 2020 Such plans are commonplace in communist systems but North Korea hasnt produced one since the 1980sKim said that the period since the last Workers Party congress was an unprecedentedly grim struggle in North Koreas long history  Over the next five years North Korea should fly the flag of victory and become a scientific and technological economic and highly civilized power Kim saidIt is imperative to carry through the five-year strategy for the state economic development from 2016 to 2020 Kim reportedly told the congress It is necessary to further increase the might of the politico-ideological power and military powerAlthough there were few other details analysts said it was remarkable that Kim had spoken publicly about his plans for economic growth His father who died in 2011 and presided over a period of economic devastation and widespread famine did not utter public statements that he could be held accountable forBut Kim Jong Un has been promoting a byungjin  or simultaneous pursuit  policy under which he has been trying to grow the economy and develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles to deliver them  The Souths Bank of Korea estimates that the Norths economy has been growing at about 1 or 2percent a year but Andrei Lankov a North Korea specialist at Kookmin University in Seoul agrees with other analysts who think that its growth has been much higher potentially as high as the 7percent estimate from the Hyundai Economic Research Institute in SeoulRecent events also prove that North Korea is making technical advances on its weapons program North Korean scientists would have learned more about their technical abilities and shortcomings during the nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch in February They would also have learned from their more  Jeffrey Lewis an arms control expert at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California has saidDuring the congress Kim repeated the line that North Korea would not go on the offensive with its weaponsAs a responsible nuclear weapons state our republic will not use a nuclear weapon unless its sovereignty is encroached upon by any aggressive hostile forces with nukes Kim told the meeting according to KCNAPlans to deploy an American antimissile battery to South Korea and the growing North Korean threat will be at the top of James Mattiss agenda this week when the new defense secretary visits South Korea and Japan on his first foreign tripMattis a retired Marine general nicknamed Mad Dog will meet with Han Min-koo the South Korean defense minister in Seoul on Thursday before heading to Tokyo Han is expected to reiterate South Koreas commitment to hosting the Terminal High Altitude Aerial Defense system or THAADBut with China exacting economic revenge on South Korea over its  and the South Korean government in crisis some in Seoul now have jitters about the planMoon Jae-in an opposition candidate running at the top of the presidential polls has said decisions on the THAAD deployment should wait until the next South Korean administration is in placeThat could take months with the Constitutional Court now deciding whether to uphold the National Assemblys motion to impeach President Park Geun-hye who made the decision to host THAAD for her role in a sensational political scandal If the court forces her from office elections must be held within 60 days Otherwise they will take place in December as scheduled   In the meantime the Chinese government  which has made no secret of its opposition to the THAAD plan  is trying to persuade South Korean political leaders to change their mindsAlthough Washington and Seoul insist that its purpose is to guard against the threat of North Korean missiles Beijing views the system as another attempt to curtail its military expansionIn recent weeks China has slapped a number of trade sanctions on South Korea in an apparent effort to dissuade Seoul from going ahead with the deploymentChina is one of the biggest reasons why people are opposing THAAD and I would say that its based on reasonable concerns said Kim Dong-yub of the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul Just go into a department store and you can feel the change he said referring to the sudden drop in Chinese tourists coming to South KoreaIn the past month China has banned imports of South Korean bidet toilet seats and South Korean cosmetics which are hugely popular among young women who love Korean dramas Classical musicians have joined K-pop stars in having visas denied and concerts canceled   Meanwhile department stores in China run by Lotte the South Korean retail group have been subject to a sudden flurry of safety and hygiene inspections and tax audits although Beijing rejects any suggestion that this is related to THAADLotte owns the country club 200 miles from Seoul earmarked for the THAAD battery It will swap with the government for another parcel of landLotte appeared to be taking it slow with the internal procedures needed to be completed before the swap can take place a possible sign that it is worried about the impact on its business in China It has more than 150 stores in China and is building a huge retail and amusement park complex in the southwestern city of ChengduChinese tourists accounted for more than 70percent of Lotte Duty Frees sales in the first quarter of last year It is true that we are sandwiched between our role as a South Korean enterprise South Koreas relations with China and possible economic loss the Yonhap News Agency quoted a senior Lotte official as saying   Small South Korean companies are suffering too There has been a sharp decrease in Chinese tourists said Kim Seo-kyung who owns a clothing store in Myeongdong a fashion district in Seoul usually teeming with Chinese shoppersMaybe its because of THAAD and because the relationship between South Korea and China has soured Kim said She estimated that her revenue had fallen about 40percent since last yearBusinesses around South Korea reported a sharp drop in tourist numbers over the Lunar New Year holiday this past weekendAmerican proponents of THAAD say they hope South Korean authorities will not waverThe THAAD is a far more effective ballistic missile defense system than anything South Korea has or will have for decades said Bruce Klingner a Northeast Asia specialist at the Heritage Foundation To not deploy THAAD is to choose to put South Korea and US forces stationed there at grave risk to North Korean nuclear chemical and biological attackNorth Koreas Kim Jong Un has overseen the test of a solid-fuel rocket engine state media announced Thursday claiming a major technological advancement that could greatly increase Pyongyangs ability to strike other countries including the United StatesExperts are working to verify North Koreas latest boast but if true it would mark another worrying development in the states pursuit of weapons of mass destructionThis is dangerous said  senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey CalifBased on the images we have we cant say whether this is functional she said But at this point we need to stop thinking about whether they have this technology or not because if they dont have it now they will have it soon and we need to start preparing for that dayNorth Koreas Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Thursday published a photo of Kim with the rocket against a graffiti-style sign that read Ruthless thunderbolt of fire for the American imperialists and Park Geun-hyes clique Park is the president of South Korea and has been adopting an increasingly tough line against the North  KCNA said Kim ordered the launch of a high-power solid-fuel rocket engine that was designed and manufactured by the Korean styleThe engine spewed out huge flames with a deafening boom it saidThe engine would boost the power of ballistic rockets capable of mercilessly striking hostile forces the report said noting Kims great pleasure and satisfaction with what KCNA said was a successful testNorth Koreas rockets and missiles have been powered by a Soviet-era liquid-fuel engine which has to be loaded at the launch site That takes time which gives satellites an opportunity to spot activity taking placeBut solid-fuel rockets can be deployed much more quickly meaning there could be much less warning  if any  of a North Korean missile launch experts saidIf solid-fuel rockets are on mobile launchers which can be hidden in tunnels or buildings and wheeled out when theyre needed they could be deployed anywhere at short notice  Analysts are now poring over photos to estimate the size of the rocket and glean any other details they can about its capability But in Seoul South Koreas defense ministry was taking the claim seriouslyMoon Sang-gyun a spokesman for the defense ministry told reporters Thursday that the military is preparing countermeasuresSeparately  to be fully prepared to aggressively cope with North Koreas reckless provocations her spokesman said Thursday The previous day North Korea had threatened to North Korea has a habit of making boasts that do not appear true as it continues work on nuclear weapons and the means to deliver themIn recent months Pyongyang has claimed to have developed  and a submarine-launched ballistic missile Neither claim is borne out by seismic data and photo analysis experts say  This month Kim claimed that North Korea was able to miniaturize a nuclear warhead Analysts were skeptical although US military leaders say it is only a matter of time until North Korea masters this technologyNorth Korea is clearly making progress in some areas It is conducting frequent medium- and long-range missile tests and every test enables its scientists to fix problems and improve capabilityThis should be a concern for American policymakers Hanham saidWe have a laundry list of things that we dont want North Korea to have We dont want them to be road mobile we dont want them to have longer ranges we dont want them to have compact warheads we dont want them to have solid-fuel motors she said The North Koreans are basically going down that list and ticking everything offNorth Korea defiantly celebrated its fifth nuclear test Friday claiming that it can now make warheads small enough to fit onto a missile and warning its enemies  specifically the United States  that it has the ability to counter any attackAlthough the Norths proclaimed advancements could not be verified  and Pyongyang has a track record of exaggeration  the test appeared to mark another step toward North Koreas goal of putting a nuclear warhead on a weapon capable of reaching the mainland United StatesFridays test  the Norths second this year  underscored the ability of Kim Jong Uns regime to make progress on its nuclear and missile programs despite waves of international sanctions and isolation  This is our response to hostile powers including the United States We are sending out a message that if the enemies attack us we can counterattack Ri Chun Hee a veteran North Korean newsreader said on state television We will continue taking measures to protect our dignity and our right to exist from the American threat The test also appeared to be much bigger than North Koreas previous four detonations since its first in 2006The US Geological Survey detected an artificial  near North Koreas nuclear test site at 9 am local time on Friday a national holiday marking the 68th anniversary of the formation of the communist regime by Kim Il Sung the current leaders grandfatherThis is clearly a nuclear test said Jeffrey Lewis director of the East Asia nonproliferation program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey Calif He estimated the size at between 10 and 20 kilotons The Norths last nuclear test carried out in January was about six kilotonsThe test happened just a few hours after President Obamas plane stopped in Japan to refuel on his way home from Laos where he attended a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) The president talked to South Koreas president Park Geun-hye who was still in Laos and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said White House press secretary Josh EarnestIn a White House statement Friday Obama called the test a grave threat to regional and international security and noted Pyongyangs claims to be developing nuclear warheads capable of hitting the United States and its alliesThe United States does not and never will accept North Korea as a nuclear state Obama said Far from achieving its stated national security and economic development goals North Koreas provocative and destabilizing actions have instead served to isolate and impoverish its people through its relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile capabilities He said the latest test shows that North Korea has no interest in being a responsible member of the international communityAfter consulting by phone with the South Korean and Japanese leaders Obama said they would work with the UN Security Council and international community to impose significant penalties including new sanctions He also vowed to push ahead with deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery in South Korea and pledged to provide extended deterrence guaranteed by the full spectrum of US defense capabilitiesAt a news conference Thursday in Laos Obama dismissed Chinas objections to the THAAD deployment saying he told Chinese President Xi Jinping that we cannot have a situation where were unable to defend either ourselves or our treaty allies against increasingly provocative behavior and escalating capabilities by the North Koreans Obama added And I indicated to him that if the THAAD bothered him particularly since it has no purpose other than defensive and does not change the strategic balance between the United States and China that they need to work with us more effectively to change Pyongyangs behavior    China the closest thing North Korea has to an ally issued a statement resolutely opposing the test which it said took place despite the widespread objection of the international communityWe strongly urge North Korea to keep its promise to denuclearize to abide by relevant resolutions from the UN Security Council and to stop making any moves that worsen the situation the statement from Chinas Foreign Ministry saidIn its official announcement of what it said was a nuclear warhead explosion test North Korea claimed that it had been able to make smaller lighter and diversified nuclear warheads of higher strike powerThis has definitely put on a higher level the [countrys] technology of mounting nuclear warheads on ballistic rockets said the statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency Kim has been ordering speedy progress on missile development  as evidenced by recent salvos of medium-range missiles  and has been making observable gains with nuclear devices But there remains no clear evidence that North Koreas scientists have been able to put the two together to make a warhead that can be delivered to a targetHowever a growing number of analysts and American military chiefs believe it is just a matter of time until North Korea masters this technologyThis test seemed to have a dual purpose said Yang Moo-jin a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in SeoulDomestically Kim Jong Un wants to present himself as a strong leader standing strong against the US he said He suggested that this could be because Kim at 32 is young but also perhaps because recent high-level defections have raised speculation of cracks in the regimeInternationally this test is designed to show that sanctions imposed against North Korea and international pressure are not working Theyre urging the world to accept its failure and revise its North Korea policy Yang saidFridays test highlights North Koreas continued defiance but also the ineffectiveness of even the most recent waves of tough sanctions imposed after the nuclear test in January analysts saidThe whole expectation eight or nine months ago was that sanctions were finally going to bring North Korea to heel but clearly that is not the case said David Kang a professor of international relations at the University of Southern California Clearly they respond to pressure with pressure of their own   Still the international community is expected to look for ways to inflict more pain on North Korea which is already under sweeping sanctionsNorth Koreas desperate dependence on nuclear development is testimony to Kim Jong Uns fanatical recklessness said Park the South Korean president who cut short her visit to Laos to return to Seoul North Koreas provocations will do nothing but accelerate its self-destructionIn Tokyo prime minister Abe also struck an angry toneIf North Korea conducted a nuclear test I cant absolutely tolerate it he said We have to strongly protestAfter North Koreas nuclear test in January  which the regime claimed was of a hydrogen bomb  and a long-range ballistic missile test in February the UN Security Council imposed tough new sanctionsIt ordered a ban on mineral exports from North Korea a major source of income for the regime and strict inspections of all cargo going in and out of the country The United States followed with new financial sanctions and by designating Kim Jong Un by name for human rights abuses South Korea has also taken a strident approach closing an inter-Korean industrial park that had been a major source of revenue for the regimeBut Kim has not wavered testing a range of missiles this year and apparently making some technological progress including on a submarine-launched ballistic missileTheres now obvious progress in North Koreas nuclear and missile programs They seem to be making precisely the technical progress that people dont want said Euan Graham a security expert at the Lowy Institute in Sydney who once served as a British diplomat in Pyongyang North Korea is obviously prepared to take the economic pain and is able to continue to materially supply the two programs  On Monday North Korea launched three medium-range missiles as China was hosting a meeting of Group of 20 leaders including Obama The rockets flew 620 miles falling inside Japans air defense identification zoneA day after those launches the Security Council issued its latest condemnationThe members of the Security Council deplore all the Democratic Peoples Republic of Koreas ballistic missile activities including these launches noting that such activities contribute to [its] development of nuclear weapons delivery systems and increase tension the council said in statement Tuesday using North Koreas official nameAnalysts expect another round of discussions on ways to put pressure on North KoreaSanctions and targeted financial measures may take time to have an impact on the regimes financial condition said Bruce Klingner a northeast Asia specialist at the Heritage Foundation a conservative Washington-based think tankThe difficulty Klingner said would be in maintaining international resolve Sanctions can not be effectively implemented without the support of ChinaChinas implementation of sanctions has been patchy in the past and some analysts are concerned that Beijing angered by South Koreas decision to host an American anti-missile battery might lose its appetite for enforcement William Branigin in Washington Yoonjung Seo in Seoul Gu Jinglu in Beijing and Yuki Oda in Tokyo contributed to this reportNorth Korea fired a ballistic missile Sunday morning its first provocation since Donald Trump was elected president of the United States and one that sets up a test for the new administration in WashingtonThe missile was fired shortly before 8am local time from a known test site in North Pyongan province in the west of the country not far from the border with China and flew over the Korean Peninsula and into the Sea of Japan South Koreas joint chiefs of staff saidThe launch happened while President Trump was hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at his golf resort in Florida In a brief joint appearance after the news of the missile test the two presented a united front Abe called the test absolutely intolerable He said that in his summit with Trump at the White House on Friday the president assured me the United States will always stand with Japan 100 percentAfter Abe spoke Trump who had been standing behind him took the microphone and said I just want everybody to understand and fully know that the United States of America stands behind Japan its great ally 100percentTrump did not mention South Korea also an important US ally Neither leader answered questionsSouth Koreas military leaders were still working to analyze data from the projectile but said it appeared to be a medium-range Musudan missile the type that North Korea had been trying to perfect last year The Musudan is technically capable of flying as far as 2400 miles putting Guam within range and almost reaching Alaska But the joint chiefs said this missile appeared to fly only 300 miles  The military is determining if the missile is a modified Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile or the shorter range Rodong missile a military official told the Souths Yonhap News AgencyBut some analysts thought the launch could have been the first stages of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the United StatesI think were all waiting for the first two stages of the ICBM said Jeffrey Lewis of the Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies They finished testing that engine on the stand so now its time to test it in the airI dont think this [missile test] is designed to respond to Trump I think this is part of Kim Jong Uns continued efforts to try to advance his programs said Jon Wolfsthal a senior nonproliferation official in the Obama administration now at Harvards Belfer Center But it has the added effect of calling Trumps bluff The real question is not what North Korea has done but what the US is going to do about it he saidKims regime has declared a goal of producing an intercontinental missile that can deliver a nuclear payload to the United States and last year appeared to be making a concerted effort toward achieving that goal It conducted two nuclear tests and dozens of missile tests including eight Musudan tests Only one in June was a success flying about 250miles and reaching a surprisingly high altitudeBut the regime had not fired any since October perhaps to avoid influencing domestic politics in the United States ahead of the presidential election and in South Korea where the conservative president has been impeached and there is now a good chance of a progressive administration that is friendlier to PyongyangIn his New Years address Kim said that North Korea had test-fired in various ways for a nuclear strike to cope with the imperialists nuclear war threats and said that the country had entered the final stage of preparation for the test launch of intercontinental ballistic missile  In response Trump tweeted North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the US It wont happenBut apart from repeating the usual pledges to work to stop North Korea from reaching its nuclear goals the Trump administration has said little on what it would do to stop Kim The administration is understood to be embarking on a view of North Korea after eight years in which the Obama administration practiced strategic patience  hoping that it could wait out North KoreaIn Seoul the national security council convened a meeting and acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn said the South Korean government would work with its allies to ensure a concerted response to punish North Korea John Wagner in Florida and David Nakamura in Washington contributed to this reportNorth Korea fired three medium-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast Monday landing close to Japan in a show of force that coincided with the meeting of leaders of the worlds 20 largest economies in neighboring ChinaNorth Korea launched the missiles believed to be Rodongs from a site south of Pyongyang at 1214 pm local time South Koreas military said They flew about 600 miles and landed well inside Japans air defense identification zone the area in which Tokyo controls aircraft movementThe launches coming as the G-20 meeting continued in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou and just days before North Korea marks the 68th anniversary of the formation of its government constituted an armed protest an official from South Koreas joint chiefs of staff said in a statementWe are fully prepared to fight tonight in case North Korea makes any provocative moves the statement said according to the Yonhap News Agency using the catchphrase of the American and South Korean military alliesJapans Defense Ministry added that the missiles landed between 120 and 160 miles west of Hokkaido the northernmost of Japans four main islandsAt the G-20 meeting South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met immediately and agreed to cooperate against North KoreaIn Washington State Department spokesman John Kirby said the United States strongly condemns the launchesThese launches which have become far too common in the past several months violate multiple UN Security Council Resolutions explicitly prohibiting North Koreas launches using ballistic missile technology he said in a statement adding that US officials would raise the issue during the meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Laos on TuesdayOur commitment to the defense of our allies in the face of these threats remains ironclad Kirby saidMondays launches were just the latest salvo in a steady series of missiles coming from North Korea Last month Kim Jong Uns regime claimed a great success in launching a ballistic missile from a submarine about 300 miles toward Japan on top of making progress on its medium-range Musudan missile technology   This is a particularly tense time in the region because of frictions over the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) anti-missile battery that the United States will deploy to South Korea part of their defense against North KoreaBeijing has protested strongly against the plan viewing it as part of an American effort to restrain a strengthening China and worrying that the system will home in on Chinas military activitiesThe issue has helped close the gap between China and its erstwhile client state North Korea after the provocations of a nuclear test and long-range missile launch earlier this year Beijing and Pyongyang have traditionally been as close as lips and teeth as the saying goes but Xi Jinping Chinas president has made his disdain for the young Kim clear  Earlier in the day during a bilateral meeting at the G-20 with Xi Park said she hoped Seoul and Beijing would be able to unite together against North KoreaI hope that through earnest communication our two countries can turn this challenge into an opportunity to further strengthen and move forward our bilateral relationship Park said during a bilateral meeting with Xi according to YonhapBut Xi reiterated his strong objections to Parks decision to accept the THAAD battery onto South Korean soilMishandling the issue is not conducive to strategic stability in the region and could intensify disputes Xi told Park according to a report from the Chinese state-run news agency XinhuaNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un boasted about the greatest success of a ballistic missile launched from a submarine this week which appeared to be a major technological breakthrough for the nuclear-armed nationAfter a series of flops North Korea launched a missile from a submarine near its east coast port of Sinpo early Wednesday It flew about 300 miles before falling into the sea inside Japans air defense identification zone the area in which Tokyo controls aircraft movementThe launch apparently of a KN-11 or North Star missile contravenes UN resolutions and was roundly condemned by Japan South Korea and China as well as by the United States and the United NationsBut in North Koreas state news media Thursday the apparently successful launch was cause for major celebration The Rodong Sinmun the newspaper of the ruling Korean Workers Party carried seven color photos on its front page Thursday including a large one of Kim surrounded by military officials all of them smiling broadlySuch images are used in North Korean propaganda in an effort to convince the populace who have little if any access to outside information that their impoverished and technologically backward country is strong and standing up to a United States that the state media say is trying to destroy North Korea  Kim lauded the missile launch as a great manifestation and demonstration of the tremendous power and inexhaustible muscle according to the state-run Korean Central News AgencyNorth Korea has joined the front rank of the military powers fully equipped with nuclear attack capability and the US mainland is now within North Koreas striking range he saidThe missile was launched at a steep angle a South Korean military source told Yonhap News Agency in Seoul and probably could have traveled for more than 600 miles if it had been fired at a regular angleThe launch coincided with the start of annual drills between the South Korean and US militaries exercises that always elicit an angry reaction from the North which views them as a pretext for an invasion The young North Korean leader came out with another round of bluster ThursdayI do not guess what ridiculous remarks the US and its followers will make about this test-fire but I can say their rash acts will only precipitate their self-destruction Kim reportedly said    The military has also clearly been trying to advance its ballistic missile program conducting a series of land- and sea-based tests over the past year It appears to be trying to work on its intermediate-range Musudan missile which can theoretically reach Guam and its submarine-launched missiles which would give it the ability to stage an attack from seaThe tests have had a patchy record of success The most recent KN-11 launches  three in the past year  were all deemed failures because the missiles exploded at launch or traveled only a short distanceBut analysts say that even failures offer lessons for North Koreas rocket scientistsJoseph S Bermudez a military analyst affiliated with the Washington-based US-Korea Institute at SAIS said this weeks test showed that North Korea remains strongly committed to the long-term development of an operational submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) and is learning from its previous successes and failures Assuming the current rate of development while North Korea still faces significant technological challenges including building a new class of submarine to carry the missile it is on track to develop the capability to strike targets in the region  including Japan  by 2020 Bermudez said in a commentary   The latest launch was widely condemnedStphane Dujarric spokesman for UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said North Koreas defiance of the international community was deeply troubling The foreign ministers of Japan South Korea and even China North Koreas main ally said after a meeting in Tokyo that the launch was totally unacceptableNorth Korea launched four missiles Monday morning a provocative barrage that coincided both with joint US-South Korean military exercises on the southern half of the peninsula and with the opening of the annual National Peoples Congress in ChinaThe launches follow a remarkable month in which Kim Jong Uns regime tested a solid-fuel rocket that it says is part of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the United States and in which the regime is accused of assassinating the leaders half brother Both actions have angered allies and adversaries in the region and Mondays launches will only exacerbate thatEvery year this time they try to do something to defy the exercises said Bruce Bennett a North Korea expert at the Rand Corp in California This time I think theyre also interested in making a statement to the Chinese and to let Beijing know this coal ban is going to hurt he said referring to Beijings decision last month to stop importing coal from North Korea cutting off a major economic lifelineThe four missiles were fired from a known launch site on North Koreas west coast not far from the border with China at 736 am local time They flew more than 600 miles across the country before splashing into the sea between Japan and the Korean Peninsula the Souths Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a text message to local reportersThe joint chiefs initially suspected that at least one of the projectiles might have been an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the United States West Coast but later backed away from that analysis A US defense official said the Pentagon does not think the missile was an ICBMThe US Strategic Command said its systems detected and tracked the projectile but determined the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America  Regardless the launches have ratcheted up the tensions in the regionSouth Korea strongly condemns North Koreas missile launch today as a direct challenge and grave provocation despite warnings by the international community Hwang Kyo-ahn the prime minister who is acting president said during an emergency meeting of the national security council North Koreas nuclear missile provocation is a real and imminent threat against the lives and safety of South KoreansIn Japan the government said three of the missiles had landed perilously close splashing down within its exclusive economic zone and within about 200 miles of its coastline in Akita prefectureThese missile launches clearly show that North Korea has developed a new threat a visibly worried Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters in Tokyo We will collect information and strongly protest to North KoreaBennett of Rand said the range of the missiles could have served as a warning to China The missiles had 12 of Chinas 20 largest cities within reach he saidChina expressed its dismay over the launch with a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman saying it opposes launches that undermine UN resolutions Russia meanwhile was more blunt describing itself as seriously worried about the launches which raise tensions in the region   North Korea has repeatedly claimed to be working on an ICBM capable of reaching the west coast of the United States and has been making observable progress toward this goal In his New Years address Kim said North Korea had entered the final stage of preparation for a test-launch of an intercontinental ballistic missileRegardless of whether Mondays launch was an ICBM it is just a matter of time until North Korea succeeds in its goal of making one said Jeffrey Lewis director of the East Asia Non-Proliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in CaliforniaIt doesnt matter if its today or tomorrow or next week or next year  thats where this is heading Lewis said But we have no plan other than saying this is unacceptable or that it wont happen he added referring to a tweet from President Trump earlier this yearAfter Kims statement in a Jan 1 address that North Korea was working on its ICBM program Trump tweeted It wont happen His administration is reviewing its policy toward North Korea which was characterized as strategic patience during the Obama administration  waiting for sanctions to hurt and a humbled Kim to come to the negotiating table   The latest provocation came as large-scale military exercises involving more than 320000 South Korean and US troops and high-tech US firepower continue in South Korea They began last week and will continue through the end of AprilIn the past year or two the  with the two militaries practicing decapitation strikes on the North Korean leadershipNorth Korea denounced the exercises and warned last week that it was ready to retaliate North Korea will never remain a passive onlooker to the new US administration overtly revealing its intention to put military pressure on [North Korea] and invade it while crying out for peace by dint of strength the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported in a statement it attributed to the Foreign MinistryNorth Korea last month  its first since Trump was elected president The missile appeared to show significant technological advances with upgraded power and range and analysts said it could mark another step in the push toward the capacity to hit Alaska or Washington stateAfter that Kims regime is suspected of ordering the assassination on the leaders half brother Kim Jong Nam who was attacked with a chemical weapon at the airport in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia and died within 20 minutesThe assassination led the Trump administration to  to go to New York for meetings with former US officials involved in North Korea policy which would have been the first time in more than five years that such a meeting had taken place on US soil  Yoonjung Seo in Seoul Yuki Oda in Tokyo and Missy Ryan in Washington contributed to this reportNorth Korea on Sunday declared that it had successfully put an earth observation satellite into orbit under the direct orders of leader Kim Jong Un and said it planned to launch many moreBoth the South Korean defense ministry and the  launched at 9 am North Korean time from a launch pad near the Chinese border appeared to have successfully reached spaceThe United States Japan and South Korea immediately condemned the launch a move widely seen as another step toward North Korea mastering the technology for making a missile capable of striking the mainland United States The UN Security Council called an emergency meeting for later Sunday to discuss how to respond to the countrys latest provocationBut North Korea gloated about its most recent advance into space It said it that it had fired a Kwangmyongsong-4 (the name translates as lode star) a newer-model satellite than the one launched three years ago and one that it said was equipped with devices for Earth measurement and communicationTodays success is a proud result of scientific achievement and an exercise of our legitimate right to space Ri Chun Hee North Koreas most famous newsreader who was brought out of retirement to announce  declared in a special broadcast from Pyongyang following the launchThe success of Kwangmyongsong-4 launch is a groundbreaking event The National Aerospace Development Administration plans to launch many more satellites following our national policy of focusing on the importance of science and technology she saidKim the 33-year-old third-generation leader of North Korea personally signed the order to launch on Saturday Ri said The satellite entered orbit after nine minutes and 46 seconds she said in the broadcast on The launch took place half an hour before the Republican presidential debate started and candidates Donald Trump and Sen Marco Rubio (R-Fla) both urged China to get tough  The rocket launch was expected  Pyongyang had  to maritime and airspace authorities and analysts had detected movement at its launch site  but coming just a month after a nuclear test it nevertheless showed Kims continued willingness to defy the international communityThe rocket was projected to fly down South Koreas west coast with the first stage expected to splash down near the southern island of Jeju while the second stage was forecast to go over the southern Japanese islands of Okinawa and in the sea east of the Philippines Television stations in Japan and South Korea showed footage of the rocket flying through the skyThe rocket went missing from South Korean military radar in the sea near Jeju Island at 936 am said defense ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun but the Japanese government said that it passed over the southern islands of Okinawa at about 941 am There were no reports of any debris falling on landWe can definitely say that this was an attempted space launch said Melissa Hanham a nuclear expert at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation StudiesNorth Korea previously fired a Kwangmyongsong-3 on an Unha-3 (galaxy) missile into orbit in December 2012 the month that North Korea marked the first anniversary of the death of Kim Jong Il the current leaders father Kims regime had said it would launch the same kind of satellite into orbit  and the launch came a few hours after that window began Sundays launch also coincides with another key date North Koreas celebration of Kim Jong Ils birthday Feb 16North Korea has said the launches were of satellites intended for scientific purposes but analysts and many governments see this as a disguised missile test North Korea has successfully launched short- and medium-range missiles but has been working to develop a reliable long-range intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the West Coast of the United StatesThis kind of rocket is designed as a space launch vehicle Before we can consider it an intercontinental ballistic missile there are a number of modifications that have to be made Hanham said A space rocket goes into the atmosphere to launch a satellite into orbit but an intercontinental ballistic missile needs to return to Earth from the atmosphere to reach its target  and deliver a warheadJim Walsh a research associate in the Security Studies Program at MIT said that even though most of North Koreas rocket and missile tests had been failures and Pyongyang was still using liquid-launched rockets a technology now considered archaic everywhere else there was still reason for concernThis doesnt mean that theyre not making progress The more tests they do the more they learn and theyre beavering away trying to improve their technology he said And it also means that at some level theyre still able to evade sanctionsNevertheless the international community immediately resumed calls for North Korea to face strong punishment for its actions through more sanctionsA spokesman for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called the launch deeply deplorable and exhorted North Korea to halt its provocative actions and return to compliance with its international obligations Both South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called emergency meetings of their national security councils during which both said they could not accept such a provocationFrom Washington Susan Rice President Obamas national security adviser said that the launch using ballistic missile technology following so closely after North Koreas fourth nuclear test represents yet another destabilizing and provocative action and is a flagrant violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutionsNorth Koreas missile and nuclear weapons programs represent serious threats to our interests  including the security of some of our closest allies  and undermine peace and security in the broader region she said in a statement  Rice also reiterated calls  mainly directed at China North Koreas closest ally and a veto-wielding permanent member of the Security Council  for the international community to stand together and demonstrate to North Korea that its reckless actions must have serious consequencesBut China does not seem particularly keen to crack down on its neighbor A  immediately after the launch said Amid criticism and condemnation what should be borne in mind is that negotiations are the only viable solution to the predicament on the Korean Peninsula as China has repeatedly pointed outA series of UN resolutions has prohibited North Korea from carrying out nuclear or ballistic missile tests but Kims regime has shown little regard for these orders Yoongjung Seo in Seoul and Yuki Oda in Tokyo contributed to this reportNorth Korea was practicing to strike United States military bases in Japan with its  state media in Pyongyang reported Tuesday and it appeared to be trying to outsmart a new American antimissile battery being deployed to South Korea by firing multiple rockets at onceKim Jong Un presided over Mondays launch of the four missiles feasting his eyes on the trails of ballistic rockets the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported in a statement that analysts called a brazen declaration of the countrys intent to strike enemies with a nuclear weapon if it came under attackIf the United States or South Korea fires even a single flame inside North Korean territory we will demolish the origin of the invasion and provocation with a nuclear tipped missile the KCNA statement saidThe four ballistic missiles fired Monday morning were launched by the elite Hwasong ballistic missile division tasked to strike the bases of the US imperialist aggressor forces in Japan KCNA said The United States has numerous military bases and about 54000 military personnel stationed in Japan the legacy of its postwar security alliance with the countryThree of the four missiles flew about 600 miles over North Korea and landed in the sea within Japans exclusive economic zone off the Oga Peninsula in Akita prefecture home to a Japanese self-defense forces base The fourth fell just outside the zone  North Korea did not say what kind of missiles it had fired but after poring over photos released by state media analysts at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California said they were extended-range Scuds capable of flying more than 600 milesNorth Korea has tested these types of missiles before so the point of Mondays launches was not to see if the rockets would fly but to test how quickly the unit could set them up and deploy them  classic training for a wartime situation said Jeffrey Lewis director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury InstituteThey want to know if they can get these missiles out into the field rapidly and deploy them all at once Lewis said They are practicing launching a nuclear-armed missile and hitting targets in Japan as if this was a real war  North Koreas extended-range Scud is halfway between a traditional short-range Scud and the medium-range missile known as the Rodong But they can be produced much more cheaply than the Rodong Lewis said meaning that North Korea could fire them with more abandonKCNA reported that the four missiles were launched simultaneously and that Kim commented that they are so accurate that they look like acrobatic flying corps in formationThis appeared to be a further challenge to the United States and South Korea which said Tuesday that it had started deploying the advanced antimissile battery called Terminal High Altitude Area Defense or THAAD designed to protect the region against North Koreas rockets The first parts of the THAAD system arrived Monday at Osan Air Base south of Seoul South Koreas Defense Ministry saidBut THAAD would have difficulty intercepting four missiles launched at the same time analysts saidFurthermore Osan Air Base is less than 300 miles from the missile launch site in North Korea  another apparent message to Pyongyangs enemiesThe launches coincided with joint US-South Korean military exercises on the southern half of the Korean Peninsula drills that take place every year and that North Korea views as preparation for an invasion After the missiles were launched Monday the US Strategic Command said it had determined that the missile launch did not pose a threat to North AmericaBut KCNA reported that the 33-year-old Kim had ordered the strategic forces to be on high alert as required by the grim situation in which an actual war may break out anytime and get fully ready to promptly moveNorth Korea has been making clear progress on its missile program and has a declared goal of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the West Coast of the United States It has also conducted five nuclear tests and claims to be able to miniaturize a warhead so that it could be fitted onto a missileHowever it has not yet proven the ability to either attach a warhead to a missile or to be able to deliver a missile to a target  something that would involve mastering the difficult step of reentry  The launches also appeared designed to send a message to both President Trump and the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe said Joshua Pollack editor of the Nonproliferation ReviewWe might infer that the choice of Japan as a target might be based on a desire to do something new compared to last year  raising the stakes of the exercises  but also on Abes visit to the US and joint appearances with Trump Pollack saidNorth Korea launched a medium-range missile last month  its first since Trump was elected  while the president was hosting Abe for dinner at his Mar-a-Lago Club in FloridaTrump spoke by phone with Abe and South Koreas acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn Tuesday morningBoth Japan and the US confirmed that this North Korean missile launch was a clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions and was an obvious challenge to the region and the international community Abe told reporters in Tokyo repeating his assertion that the North Korean threat had reached a new stageIn New York a spokesman for UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres said he condemned the actions which violate Security Council resolutions and seriously undermine regional peace and stabilityPyongyang cant stop shooting (a) missiles into the sea and (b) itself in the footAt 736 am Monday local time North Korea launched four missiles that flew about 600 miles over land before splashing into the Sea of Japan As my colleague Anna Fifield  three landed within Japans exclusive economic zone dropping about 200 miles from the coastThe test was timed to provoke It came not a month after North Korea tested a solid-fuel rocket that it claims is part of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the United States and three weeks after the in Malaysia of ruler Kim Jong Uns half brother Kim Jong Nam who had been under Chinese protectionIt also coincided withjoint US-South Korean military exercises on the southern half of the Korean Peninsula and to Beijings certain dismay the opening of Chinas National Peoples Congress the Communist Partys tightly scripted not-to-be-interrupted-or-overshadowed political spectacleIndeed although North Korea has been getting on a lot of nerves lately it may be China that is most acutely frustrated And since China is North Koreas only real ally that could hurt Kim Jong UnChina and North Korea used to be tight Mao Zedong once said the neighbors were as close as lips and teethBut in recent years China has grown frustrated with the Norths potentially destabilizing economic woes as well as a nuclear program that from Beijings perspective keeps the US military at the gateAlthough critics have long accused Beijing of propping up the Kim regime the Chinese side responded to last months rocket test and assassination with what appeared to be a real piece of economic punishment Beijing  coal imports  a financial lifeline for North Korea  until the end of 2017Mondays test will only deepen Beijings displeasure China is in the midst of a major campaign against US plans to deploy the  (THAAD) system to South Korea THAAD is a land-based missile defense system that would be operated by US troops stationed in South Korea Seoul and Washington argue it is a necessary defense against North KoreaBut China hates the plan To Beijing THAAD is a security threat designed to undermine the Chinese military a strategic plot hatched by the Americans In recent weeks China has stepped up public criticism of the project and moved to punish South Korea for forging ahead with the plan>Chinas party-controlled press is already  about destroying or blinding the THAAD system To express its displeasure with South Korea China has also  to pop stars and pulled wildly popular South Korean television dramas off the air Lets see how far South Korean TV dramas and stars can go without strong support from the Chinese market read one editorial in the Global Times a newspaper known for its nationalist toneThe THAAD installation is a mighty blow against strategic mutual trust between Beijing and Seoul the paper continued Ties will inevitably hit rock bottom and this will be a loss for both sides In the long-run China needs to get ready to confront SeoulThe US and South Korea are not dealing with the THAAD issue very well because they have not fully considered Chinas security concernssaidCui Zhiying director of the Korean Peninsula Research Center at Shanghais Tongji University All parties should cooperate on this issue instead of the US and South Korea getting together to suppress ChinaAnd thats just it China never liked North Koreas missile tests but right now they are particularly inconvenient Interrupting Chinas National Peoples Congress with yet another missile test makes it harder for Beijing to rail against South Koreas plans because it makes THAADs stated purpose  shooting down North Korean missiles  seem legitChina on Monday expressed wary dismay at the latest development with a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry saying Beijing opposes launches that undermine United Nations Security Council resolutions Behind closed doors Chinese cadres will no doubt have more to say to their erstwhile friendsKeeping up its drumbeat of colorfully worded threats North Korea warned Wednesday that it may launch an ultra-precision strike to scorch the South Korean presidents officeTensions are running high on the Korean Peninsula as the United States and South Korea conduct  and mounting  against Pyongyang start to biteIncensed at both efforts North Koreas propaganda machine has been outdoing itself with ever-more

Central News Agency using the Korean term for South Koreas presidential Blue House President Park Geun-hye lives and works thereAll the dens of the enemy in South Korea including the Cheong wa Dae are the primary targets of the ultra-precision strike means it said Powerful large-caliber multiple-rocket-launching systems are at the ready to scorch the Cheong wa Dae bossed by Park Geun-hye in a jiffy  North Koreas state media have recently been running footage of Kim Jong Un the states leader overseeing launches from what it calls a Korean-style large-caliber multiple-launch rocket system Some of the projectiles  appear to have been launched from a mobile system akin to the one Pyongyang has describedOnce their buttons are pushed [Cheong wa Dae] is bound to be reduced to a sea in flames and ashes the committee said in the reportTensions between the two Koreas divided since the end of World WarII have been running particularly high in recent months after Kim in January ordered the  and then oversaw what is thought to have been the launch of a Park who had been pursuing a trustpolitik approach of using carrots and sticks on North Korea has this year abandoned any attempt at engaging the Pyongyang regime and has instead taken a surprisingly tough approach  She  that had generated hundreds of millions of dollars for the North and imposed tough new sanctions on the regimeNorth Koreas response has been typically shrill but also  with the regime calling the Souths first female president a capricious whore among various choice labelsPark vowed Wednesday to continue exerting pressure on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programsWe will create the conditions in which North Korea cannot survive unless it changes she said in a speech at a hotel in Seoul according to the Yonhap News AgencyNorth Korea has a habit of making threats on which it cannot practically follow through Nevertheless the annual joint military exercises in the South and the increased military activities in the North have ensured that tensions are running higher than usualThe diplomats decision to defect from a regime he had spent his whole life defending did not happen overnightInstead his misgivings had been simmering for two decades even as he went around Europe espousing the superiority of the North Korean system They finally reached a boiling point when Thae Yong-ho realized that this regime to which he had been so loyal expected him to lie to his childrenIve known that there was no future for North Korea for a long time Thae told The Washington Post in his first interview with the foreign media since his escape from the North Korean Embassy in London where he served as deputy ambassadorBut last summer he realized his hopes had been misplaced that supreme leader  who was educated in Switzerland and is only 33 would turn out to be a reformer Thae fled together with his wife and his two sons now ages 19 and 26Kim Jong Un is still young Thae said I was afraid that even my grandsons would have to live under this system I decided that if I didnt cut the chains of slavery off [my sons] they would complain Why didnt you let us be freeThae is the highest ranking diplomat to defect from North Korea After several months being debriefed by the South Korean intelligence service he was in Seoul speaking out against the regimes reign of terror   Over the past month Thae has predicted to South Korean media the demise of North Korea with the same fervor with which he once extolled its glories His hard-line statements happen to fit nicely with the hawkish stance taken by the South Korean government over the past eight years But Thae said he was not being expedient and was speaking his real mind  and was intent on using his influence for goodEveryone knows about my defection Just staying at home or living a quiet life would not effect any change in North Korea Thae a genial 54-year-old who speaks impeccable English said during an interview in a hotel hereSouth Korean authorities are concerned about Thaes safety and the possibility of an attempt on his life North Korea released a tirade against him after his defection calling him human scum and a criminal and has made attempts  once successfully  on the lives of other high-profile defectors Thae was accompanied by an entourage of bodyguards and intelligence officials to the interviewHe spent more than two hours describing his disappointment with Kim his fears for his children and his conviction that giving North Koreans information about the outside world would help sow the seeds of dissent  just as it had for him and his familyThe regime can only stay in place by preventing outside information he said People there are not educated about the outside world and have no opportunity to experience freedom or a system that is differentIn North Korea the Internet is banned for all but a handful of elites radios and televisions play only state propaganda and the newspapers are full of the leaders great feats South Korean dramas are increasingly being smuggled into North Korea but people watch them in secret fearing severe punishment if they are caughtThae said that anything to break the information blockade in North Korea should be encouraged from USB drives containing foreign films to radios that can be tuned to news broadcasts from abroadI would like to make it possible for people to rise up he said We should educate the North Korean people so that they can have their own Korean SpringThaes grandfather and father were devoted to the Kim dynasty and Thae grew up knowing only North Koreas peculiar brand of communist personality cult Then in the 1990s as a relatively young diplomat he was posted to Denmark where his younger son was born and after that to SwedenIn Scandinavia home to the flagbearers of European socialism Thaes eyes began to openDuring my first foreign posting in Denmark I came to doubt and question whether North Korea could say that it was a true socialist or communist system he said Thaes time there coincided with a devastating famine in North Korea that killed as many as 3 million peopleNorth Korean society doesnt have the concept of comparing he said The more time you spend in the outside world the disbelief in your system grows more and moreThae then did two stints in the embassy in London first between 2004 and 2008 then from 2013 until his defection last summer It was during this second stint in London in the second year of Kim Jong Uns regime that Thaes concerns started to become unbearableNot only me but other North Korean elites were hopeful that because Kim Jong Un had studied abroad and was young he might change the policy direction and modernize North Korea he saidBut Kim soon showed his intention to continue his fathers pursuit of nuclear weapons and his reluctance to introduce the economic reforms the impoverished country badly needsKim Jong Un made it very clear that North Korea should complete the path toward nuclear development Thae said This kind of policy is regarded by most North Korean elites like me as very fanatical because it pushes North Korea into a corner of self-destruction   The doubts heightened after Kim had his uncle  executed at the end of 2013 Although executions are not rare in North Korea there was something disturbingly arbitrary about this one Thae saidStill he continued his duties in London  with free housing health care and educationBut at home Thaes younger son who was still in high school and hoped to study computer science at a top London university was asking why North Korea doesnt allow the Internet why North Koreans are not allowed to watch foreign films why North Koreans cant read any books they wantAs a father it was hard for me to tell lies and it started a debate within the family Thae said This North Korean system is a really inhuman system It even abuses the love between parents and their childrenSo last July after much preparation and as the end of his posting was approaching Thae escaped with his wife and both their sonsThae declined to discuss the specifics of how his family fled saying that giving away details could close off the escape route for other North Korean officials abroadHis arrival in South Korea was the most high profile of what is said to be a string of elite defections Last year the government in Seoul hinted that there had been numerous defections from the military and diplomatic service as well as among officials charged with raising money for Kim himselfThe South Korean government and some analysts have portrayed the defections as signs of cracks in Kims regime which has endured despite repeated predictions of its imminent collapse A former intelligence official told The Post that about 100 elite defectors have been debriefed at a secret residential center run by the governmentThere is no sense of solidarity or loyalty between Kim Jong Un and senior officials Thae said Senior officials know that this system cant continueStill Thae described feeling shame about his previous role saying he was an actor who pretended to love the systemNow he is trying to fix that Ive decided to spend the rest of my life meaningfully and I want to do something significant not just for my family but also my countryKim Jong Nam the half brother of the North Korean leader died a very painful death within 20 minutes of having poison smeared on his face Malaysian authorities said SundayThis suggests he was exposed to an overwhelming amount of VX a nerve agent that is classified as a weapon of mass destruction S Subramaniam Malaysias health minister saidThe absorption level was so rapid that within a few minutes the guy had symptoms Subramaniam told reporters in Kuala Lumpur Malaysias capital From the time of the onset he died within 15 to 20 minutesKim Jong Nam the estranged older brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was attacked in the busy Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb 13 by two women who wiped a substance on his face and in his eyes They fled while their victim sought help but he died in an ambulance on the way to the hospitalMalaysian police said Friday that the autopsy showed Kim Jong Nam died of exposure to VX a chemical weapon that can be absorbed through the skin or mucous membranes   All suspicions about the attack rest with the regime in Pyongyang Malaysia has implicated eight North Koreans  including a diplomat said to be hiding in the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur and a scientist whom Malaysia has in custodySouth Korea has bluntly blamed the assassination on Kim Jong Un accusing him of trying to eliminate potential rivals to his power while the  for North Korean diplomats who were to arrive in New York this week for talks with former US officials The decision was made after Malaysia announced the finding of VXVX is banned under the international  but North Korea is not a signatory Pyongyang is thought to have the worlds third-largest stocks of chemical weapons behind the United States and Russia and is believed to have been pursuing VX according to the VX is a nerve agent that interferes with the workings of the major organs including the lungs leading to death by muscle paralysisThe muscle goes into a state of permanent contraction Subramaniam said The dose that the 45-year-old victim received was so high that his heart and lungs would have been affected quickly he said   After the autopsy results  and 11 days after the attack  teams in hazmat suits swept the airport terminal for traces of VX or other toxins but found none and declared the terminal safeMembers of the medical staff who helped Kim are being monitored but none has shown symptoms Subramaniam saidQuestions are being raised about how the two women who carried out the attack apparently without wearing gloves managed to survive Security camera footage shows them going to the bathroom immediately after the attack presumably to wash their handsSiti Aishah who is Indonesian and was reportedly the first to apply the oil-like substance to Kim Jong Nam told police she vomited in a taxi after leaving the airport and continued to feel unwell She is being testedAishah has repeatedly told police that she was tricked into carrying out the attack she says she was told that it was a prank and was paid about $100 for taking part However the security footage shows the women acting with determination and immediately rushing off after the attack   Malaysian authorities say that no one from Kim Jong Nams family has come forward to claim his body They have been asking for a DNA match before releasing the body and there were reports last week that his 22-year-old son had arrived from Macau but these turned out to be falseNorth Korea has angrily denounced every part of the investigation accusing the South Korean government of persuading Malaysia to besmirch Pyongyangs reputation by laying the blame on itNorth Koreas ambassador in Kuala Lumpur strongly objected to an autopsy being carried out at all saying that the victim  whom he did not identify  was carrying a diplomatic passport and was therefore not subject to Malaysian lawsMalaysia has however insisted that it will follow all usual procedures for investigating a suspicious deathNorth Korea shot a ballistic missile startlingly close to Japan on Wednesday sparking stern condemnations from Tokyo Seoul and WashingtonThe medium-range Rodong missile splashed down about 150 miles off the countrys northwest coast Japans Defense Ministry said suggesting it could have landed inside Japans exclusive economic zone Wednesdays actions were the latest apparent protest from North Korea over a decision by Seoul and Washington to bring an antimissile battery system to South KoreaNorth Korea has never sent a missile into Japans exclusive economic zone on the Sea of Japan side of the island chain although in 1998 North Korea fired a Taepodong-1 missile  ostensibly launching a satellite  over Japan and into its economic zone on the Pacific Ocean sideMap coordinates showed the missile landing about 160 miles from the Japanese coast within Japans 200-mile EEZ This would put it within a minute of reaching Japan itself said Euan Graham who served as a British diplomat in Pyongyang North Koreas capital  Its a clear case of walking right up to the line and just putting a nose over it said Graham now an East Asian security expert at the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney Its a provocative actSouth Koreas Joint Chiefs of Staff and the US Strategic Command said they detected two simultaneous launches of Rodong intermediate-range ballistic missiles from the North Korean launch site in the southwest of the country shortly before 8 am local time WednesdayOne appeared to explode shortly after launch they saidBut the other appeared to fly over the peninsula and some 12minutes later to land 620 miles away in the waters off the Akita prefecture  The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system aimed at intercepting North Korean missiles is set to be deployed near the rural area of Seongju South Korea some 200 miles southeast of Seoul by the end of next year The plan is controversial among residents in the area many of whom fear they will become a target for North KoreaPyongyang has called the THAAD battery vicious warmongering and has threatened a nuclear strike against the siteMeanwhile China views the deployment as a thinly disguised attempt to keep it in check Beijing seized on Wednesdays launch as further proof that the United States plan to deploy the system was causing instability in the regionSouth Korea is putting the cart before the horse in their pursuit of national security as the key to security lies in good neighborly and friendly relations with its neighbors rather than a bunch of US-made missiles the Chinese state-run news agency South Korean military officials told reporters in Seoul that Wednesdays launches the latest in a volley of missiles North Korea has fired in recent months suggested Pyongyang was trying to show off its ability to target and perhaps even hit nearby countries it deemed hostileAfter the launch of shorter-range Scud missiles last month North Korean state media ran footage showing Kim Jong Un sitting in front of maps that  right down to the southern port city of Busan within rangeWith Wednesdays launches Pyongyang was signaling to Tokyo that it also had the capacity to strike Japan Graham noted And although North Korea relies on the support of China the latest act will probably set alarm bells ringing in Beijing because it means the Chinese capital is also in rangeKims regime would almost certainly never hurl missiles toward China but its ability to do so could increase Beijings rationale for developing its own missile defense system Graham said  Fears about North Koreas technical abilities have been mounting While some of North Koreas recent missile launches especially of the Musudan-type missile appear to have been failures analysts say that the Norths scientists are honing their technology with every testThe progress North Korea is making might embolden the regime and encourage it to take even more incendiary action Tokyo said in its annual defense white paper released Tuesday North Korea appeared to be making progress in its aim to make nuclear warheads capable of being carried to the mainland United States it saidAmong US allies there was sharp condemnation Wednesday of North Koreas latest defiance of The launch was an unforgivable act of aggression that represents a grave threat to the security of Japan said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe A spokesman for South Koreas Unification Ministry called the missile launch a serious provocation to South Korea and the international communityThe Pentagon urged North Korea to refrain from ratcheting up tensions in the region It should focus instead on taking concrete steps toward fulfilling its commitments and international obligations said Gary Ross a US Navy commanderBut analysts expect North Korea to continue with missile launches and other provocations over the next

are underway to bring senior North Korean representatives to the United States for talks with former American officials the first such meeting in more than five years and a sign that Pyongyang sees a potential opening with the Trump administrationArranging the talks has become a lot more complicated over the past eight days with North Korea  and the assassination of Kim Jong Uns half brother in Malaysia an act that many suspect was  Malaysian police on Sunday named as suspects four North Koreans who left the country on the day of the attackAnalysts also say they highly doubt that Pyongyang which has insisted on being recognized as a nuclear state would be willing to moderate its position on its weapons programIf the talks do take place they could offer a glimmer of hope for an already-hostile relationship that has only deteriorated as the Kim government works aggressively to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the continental United StatesThe planning for the Track 15 talks  with the US side made up of the former officials who usually take part in Track 2 talks but the North Korean side composed of government officials  is still in a preparatory stage according to people with knowledge of the arrangementsThe State Department has not approved the North Koreans visas for the talks which would take place in New York within the next few weeksThe North Koreans have expressed an interest in engagement but nothings been approved yet said one person familiar with the preparations speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss them Others who have been in touch with North Koreans describe an intense interest in what President Trump might doIf this happens it would be an interesting signal to the new administration one person said of the discussions  The talks would be the clearest indication yet that Kim wants to talk with the Trump administration If this happens I would take it as a very positive sign from both sides said another person with knowledge of the arrangementsIn recent years there have been sporadic Track 15 talks that have taken place in Kuala Lumpur Geneva Berlin and Ulaanbaatar Mongolia But these talks have not taken place in the United States since July 2011 before Kim succeeded his father in North KoreaThe planned talks are being organized by Donald S Zagoria of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy who served as a consultant on Asia during the Carter administration and has organized previous rounds of such talks Zagoria declined to comment on the preparationsThe talks would be run independently of the State Department where officials have privately questioned the utility of such discussions But if the administration issued the visas it would be an implicit seal of approval And if the discussions go well they could pave the way for official talks Choe Son Hui the director of the US affairs department in North Koreas Foreign Ministry is likely to lead the delegation from PyongyangShe is well known to American officials having participated in official meetings including the six-party talks on denuclearization as well as in other Track15 talksChoe has a direct line to Kim according to Thae Yong Ho the North Korean deputy ambassador to London who defected to South Korea last year  Since Trump was elected there has been a notable change in North Koreas usually bombastic rhetoricPyongyang had been sharply critical of the Obama administration saying its policy of strategic patience  waiting for North Korea to change its nuclear calculations  was an aggressive and heinous strategic suffocation policy against North KoreaBut in its announcement of its missile launch Feb 12 the Norths state media did not include its usual bluster about needing a deterrent against the United States and its hostile policiesIn his own statement after the launch Trump notably did not condemn Pyongyang The new president has in fact said very little about how he plans to deal with North Korea North Korea  well take care of it folks were going to take care of it all he said at his  last week without elaboratingHis administration is conducting a review of North Korea policy This provides space to broaden the options for dealing with Pyongyang and an opportunity to influence the new president analysts sayWhile some expect him to take a hard-line approach encouraged by hawkish advisers others say that Trump who prides himself on making deals could be open to dialogue with the North Korean regimeUS policy is hanging in the balance said Adam Cathcart an expert on North Korea at the University of Leeds in BritainI think the North Koreans ought to be pretty happy because the Americans have laid off criticizing them too much and have in fact been making things quite easy for them Cathcart said But at some point they are going to have to decide whether to pick up the cudgel  For those favoring an even tougher approach to North Korea recent events have provided plenty of ammunitionOn Feb 12 North Korea tested a ballistic missile for the first time since Trump was elected The missile appeared to show significant technological advances with upgraded power and range and could mark another step in the push toward the capacity to hit Alaska or Washington stateThen on Feb 13  the estranged half brother of the North Korean leader was attacked and apparently poisoned at Kuala Lumpur International Airport He died shortly afterwardAlthough the investigation is ongoing the South Korean government has blamed the assassination on Kim Jong Un who has  eliminated potential rivals to his power over the past four yearsMalaysian police have arrested one North Korean man in connection with the attack  and on Sunday named four other North Koreans suspected of being involvedThe four had been in Malaysia for several weeks but all left on the day of the attack said Noor Rashid Ibrahim Malaysias deputy national police chief on Sunday at a news conferenceComplicating the environment further the South Korean and US militaries are due to start annual joint exercises next month an event that always elicits an angry response from Pyongyang which sees the drills as a pretext for an invasionIn the past year or two the  with the two militaries practicing decapitation strikes on the North Korean leadershipAs ordinary North Koreans have found ways to get information the state denies them  soppy South Korean dramas and peppy pop songs novels news from the outside world  so too has the Kim regime found news ways to crack down on them according to a new report released WednesdayThe regime has developed sophisticated new tools to check just what its citizens are up to according to Compromising Connectivity a new report from  The report underlines the challenges in getting information into the most tightly controlled country on the planet  and the challenges that North Korea watchers as diverse as the US Congress and small defector-led groups face in trying to penetrate itIn a lot of ways the expansion of information is continuing said Nat Kretchun the lead author of the report which draws on interviews with 34 recent defectors from North Korea Its just that we also see a lot of signs that the North Korean government is gearing up to combat itKim Jong Un his father and his grandfather have kept a tight grip on the North Korean populace for more than seven decades by denying citizens access to information State television radio and newspapers laud the work of the Kim family telling North Koreans how lucky they are to live in such a strong and happy countryBut thanks to dramas smuggled in on USB sticks and illicit shortwave radio broadcasts from the outside an increasing number of North Koreans have realized that their brethren in the South enjoy unimaginable levels of wealth and freedom Being caught with such banned media can result in harsh penalties including imprisonmentAt the same time the introduction of cellphones  albeit for domestic calls only and without Internet access  is allowing people around the country to share information much more freely internally  High-profile defectors such as  who served as a North Korean diplomat in Europe for almost 20 years have described the transformative effect of outside information and have urged governments and NGOs to flood North Korea with itWhile imposing new sanctions on North Korea last year Congress allocated $50million over the next five years for radio programming and the promotion of freedom of information inside North KoreaBut the real picture is more complicated the Intermedia report saysTheyre clearly trying to innovate their way out of the breakdown of the security apparatus rather than going back to Kim Il Sung times Kretchun said referring to the founding president of the totalitarian state North Koreas security apparatus began crumbling in the 1990s after a devastating famine that gave the regime no choice but to tolerate markets  which then became a venue for sharing informationThey now have a vision of a more sophisticated but no less controlled media environment he saidTake cellphones North Koreans are now allowed such devices  including a re-branded Chinese Android-based smartphone called ArirangAs recently as 2013 North Koreans could use these to share files  including songs and text  through Bluetooth or micro-storage SD cards But a mandatory software update rolled out in 2013 included a program called TraceViewer that would collect browsing history and take periodic screenshots of activity  which the user could not delete That means the security services can see exactly what the user has been up to long after they have removed any SD card  The update also included a signature system that would prevent a device from opening any files that dont bear a North Korean state signature  and in fact automatically deletes themEven with the network restrictions that were applied at the beginning cellphones could have been a game-changing device in North Korea Kretchun said But the system update stops that from happeningNorth Korea has a unique advantage in that it can dictate what devices their people have he said He added that the state has made it very difficult for citizens to undermine their technology They put a lot of work into making sure you have to be quite technologically sophisticated to do the equivalent of jailbreaking these phonesAccess to outside networks has also been curtailed Residents on the border with China have been able to get signals on Chinese phones but the regime appears to have cracked down on this using jammers and signal detectorsOnce I went into a house and made a call to China and inspectors came within 30 seconds said a 59-year-old man who used to work for a trading company near the Chinese city of Dandong There are inspectors going around with an eavesdropping device to control calls to China he told the reports authors  But North Koreans are still able to watch movies and dramas at home relatively easilyPreviously they watched foreign movies and soap operas on DVDs smuggled into the country but in recent years they have developed a preference for USB sticks and SD cards which are easier to hide They plug the USBs or SD cards into their DVD players  which are permitted although only to watch North Korean propaganda  and make sure to have a DVD in the drive in case of a spot inspectionSmall portable DVD players called notels also are used for watching foreign dramasUsing small storage devices not only allows North Koreans to hide them easily during raids but also enables them to share media with each other All but one of the North Korean defectors Intermedia interviewed said they had shared content with othersDespite the challenges Kretchun said there was reason to keep trying to penetrate the North Korean regimes information blockade Right now all the arrows continue to point up People are still certainly watching foreign dramas and listening to the radio he saidSometimes the men just wanted to talk with the North Korean women Face cam its called But most of the time they wanted the other option body cam Watching through a smartphone app the men would ask the women some of the unknown thousands of North Koreans sold to Chinese husbands and living secretly in northern China to show their breasts or their backsides to touch themselves or perform sex acts on one anotherMost of the time the women did as requested They needed the money  even if it amounted to only a few dollars a dayIn the beginning I didnt think it was going to be a big deal I thought it would be okay because I wasnt actually sleeping with anyone said Suh who until dreams of escape brought her to this dingy room in Laos had been one of the legions of North Korean women performing online sex work in back rooms in China But then I found out how many perverts there are out thereSuh a 30-year-old who escaped from North Korea in 2008 resorted to doing video chatting after her second child was born and her husbands meager construction earnings wouldnt stretch any furtherThere are some people who just want to look at your face but the majority of them are there for their sexual desires Suh said putting her head down so her long hair covered her cherubic face I felt so disgustingTogether with two women from her village in northeastern China who were also doing chatting work Suh fled over the summer She made the heart-wrenching decision to leave her 5-year-old daughter with her Chinese husbandThe women traveled by bus and car down through China to the border with Laos which they crossed illegally in the black of night Suh carrying her 18-month-old daughter Ji-yeon on her backThe women made it to Vientiane the Laotian capital where a Washington Post reporter spent two days with them as they paused on their journey to what they hoped would be a better life The women talked for hours about their lives in North Korea and in China but unlike some defectors who exaggerate their stories to make them more sensational they appeared to play down their experiences apparently out of shame  Most of their stories could be verified with the pastor and broker who were helping them escape and  The women had a friend film them at work before they left so they could prove what they had been doing The videos showed the women  sometimes in brightly colored underwear sometimes naked  sitting against a low bed covered with a purple Hello Kitty quilt in front of two computers on a low table Men sometimes visible sometimes not gave them instructions Most of the men they chatted with online were in South Korea but a few were in America and even AfricaSafely out of China the other two women both called Kim wanted to get to South Korea but Suh had her heart set on a more ambitious destination the United States the strongest country on EarthI think my daughter is one lucky baby Suh said sitting on the bed in a grimy room in Vientiane and looking at Ji-yeon as she slept snoring lightly Their few possessions were in plastic shopping bags save for the clothes drying on coat hangers dangling from the light fittings The baby had not even one toy All the suffering is worth it Our destiny has changed Suh saidDefections such as that of  who fled to South Korea over the summer make headlines because they are so rare But less sensationally a steady if diminishing stream of North Koreans is making their way out down through China across to Laos then into Thailand and eventually to South KoreaMost are women from the northern provinces considered down-and-out even by North Korean standards and face an extremely precarious life in northeastern China Many had been sold  some knowingly thinking life couldnt get any worse But other women had been tricked into thinking they were heading to jobs in China only to find that the man who offered to help them escape paying bribes to border soldiers and arranging passage turned out to be a trafficker selling the women and pocketing the profitsThe buyers are men in the countryside who are too poor or unappealing to get a wife any other way and the women are stuck in remote villages where they cannot communicate with the locals  if they are permitted to leave the house that isSince Kim Jong Un took control of North Korea at the end of 2011 security has been tightened and it has become increasingly difficult to escape That has driven up prices Women ages 15 to 25 are the most prized fetching between $10000 and $12000 brokers and humanitarian workers say while women in their 30s can be acquired for half thatIncreased prices mean that some Chinese families are spending their entire life savings to buy a North Korean woman and as a result the women are sometimes shackled inside the houseBut even if the women are allowed out and even after they learn some Chinese venturing into the open is a risky business If theyre caught by the Chinese police they face repatriation to North Korea and at a minimum time in a labor campThese North Korean women in China faced a dire dilemma either having to remain hidden and submit to this kind of sexual exploitation or risk working outside of their residence with the very real possibility that Chinese authorities could arrest them at any time and force them back to North Korea said Phil Robertson of Human Rights WatchThe State Departments noted that North Korean women and girls are subjected to sexual slavery by Chinese or Korean-Chinese men forced prostitution in brothels or through Internet sex sites or compelled service as hostesses in nightclubs or karaoke barsThe State Department reported that the Chinese government does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking however it is making significant efforts to do soAlthough some women take the risk of working outside the home or working behind the scenes in restaurants an increasing number feel they have no choice but to try to make money behind closed doorsThat is where video chatting comes in  About one-fifth of the North Korean women living in hiding in China are involved in this kind of online sex work said Park a broker who works to get women outThe Post agreed to withhold Parks full name to avoid jeopardizing this highly sensitive work The newspaper also agreed to use the womens family names only partly to protect relatives in North KoreaIf youre working in a restaurant or outside you run the risk of being asked for your papers by the police So doing this work is safer and the money is better Park said In the village where they lived every North Korean woman does this Its so normal to be doing thisSome North Korean women in China are forced into this work essentially held prisoner by pimps The women The Post met were not forced as such But they had few other opportunitiesSuh was sold eight years ago to a man in northern China who she said treated her well  he beat her only a few times But the arrival of their second child made a tough financial situation untenable She heard about video chatting through a friend of a friend and began chatting with South Korean men at night when everyone in her house was asleepOn her first day she earned $3 In her best week she netted $120A few months ago Suh decided she couldnt take it I wondered why I had to do this Im a human being the same as everyone else Suh said breaking down into heaving sobs I wanted to be a good mother a strong mother for my daughters  She decided to try to leave along with the two others They found out about Park and Kim Sung-eun a pastor from the Caleb Mission a church in South Korea that helps bring defectors to safety and asked to be helped out For the second time in their lives they escaped this time to a safe house in northern China and from there they made the journey to the border then walked to LaosI was so scared but I kept on going I just kept on going Suh said I kept walking toward Pastor Kim and ParkLaos was safer but still somewhat of a gray area they may be sent back Once they got to Thailand the fear of repatriation to North Korea would be goneWhile waiting to cross the Mekong River the women talked about the difficult decisions they had had to make Suhs 5-year-old is listed on her Chinese fathers family register which gives her legal status in China and enables her to go to school But by the time Ji-yeon was born the back channel for registration  involving bribes to willing officials  had closed The baby doesnt legally existSo when Suh decided to flee and realized she could only manage to take one child with her she knew it had to be Ji-yeon She thinks Ive abandoned her Suh said breaking down into another torrent of tears as she recalled telling her older daughter she would be back soonThe day they were to cross into Thailand the women were full of nervous excitement But things soon went wrong Heavy rain had swollen the Mekong and their boat missed the drop pointThey were discovered by local police and taken to a prison They were terrified and sent an endless stream of messages to Park asking if they would be sent back to North Korea One photo they sent showed Ji-yeon standing in a cell looking out through the bars  Instead they were taken to Bangkok where they are now being held at a detention center the pastor saidSuh has applied for asylum in the United States even though she speaks no English and knows she will receive little support unlike in South Korea Officials from the American Embassy in Bangkok have met with Suh and her daughter the pastor said He estimated that it would take about four months for their asylum claims to be processedAn embassy spokeswoman in Bangkok declined to comment The United States has accepted 74 refugees from North Korea since Kim took power according to State Department dataDuring the pause in Vientiane the relief of being out of China had washed over the women and the challenges ahead loomed The women had begun to dwell on the handicaps that North Koreans face I have no passport no papers nothing Suh said Why are our lives so different just because of where we are bornSEOUL  The Moranbong Band is back North Koreas famous girl band had not been seen since without playing a song in December on what was supposed to be their first concert abroadWith their short skirts and high heels  whose members were chosen directly by Kim Jong Un is considered North Koreas answer to the manufactured saccharine girl bands that have come out of South Korea in recent yearsThere were multiple theories swirling about their sudden departure from Beijing in December  ranging from the Chinese authorities being annoyed at the amount of pro-Kim propaganda in their performance to rumors one of the women tried to defect Some said the concert was too close to the anniversary of former leader Kim Jong Ils death although that seemed unlikely since authorities on both sides knew that date was coming upBut this week on the anniversary of his fathers birth and a week after the countrys Kim Jong Un has been holding a range of celebrations There was a huge banquet and concert for those involved in this months launch of Kwangmyongsong-4 which North Korea says is a space launch vehicle that put a satellite into orbit but which pretty much everyone else views as cover for its ballistic missile programParty time Kim Jong Un holds a banquet/concert to celebrate rocket launch -    Anna Fifield (@annafifield) Heres what Kim said according to the official Korean Central News AgencyThe course of conquering space was for the purpose of the revolution and independence rather than for that of science and it was a fierce struggle to defend the peace and sovereignty from the hostile forces as well as to implement the behests of the great leaders Todays great success was recorded as a glorious page in the history of our Party and country as it gave confidence and courage to our people and dealt a telling blow to the enemies seeking to block the advance of our countryThe reports showed photos of banquet buffet tables complete with huge models of the rocketBut the star of the show was the girl group which performed a number of songs that were broadcast on North Korean television on WednesdayTheir return was announced in a simple sentence at the end of  At the banquet there was a performance of the Moranbong Band celebrating the successful launch of satellite Kwangmyongsong-4 the report saidKim Jong Uns wife Ri Sol Ju also appeared at the event the first time shes shown up in official media this yearThe textile factories producing made in China goods from compounds just across the Yalu River from North Korea offer a glimpse into a hidden world that is helping North Koreas economy to thriveOperated by North Koreans the factories produce clothes and other goods that are exported under foreign-company labels making it impossible to tell that they have been made with North Korean hands and have contributed to North Korean profitsThe thriving operations belie the perception in Washington that US and international sanctions are working to strangle North Koreas ability to make money While an overwhelming majority of North Koreans live in poverty the countrys output has been steadily increasing and an estimate by South Koreas  forecasts that the Norths economy will grow this year by a whopping 7percentA lot of that growth comes through Dandong a hive of North Korean and Chinese managers and traders with middlemen helping them all cover their tracks One local Chinese businessman estimates that one-quarter of this citys population of 800000 is involved in doing business with North Korea in some wayIn one factory on a recent day dozens of North Korean women sat under fluorescent strip lights sewing seams and pressing pockets on pants some of which were destined for the United StatesThey are here to make money for the country a North Korean factory manager said of the workersThis scene is repeated in dozens perhaps hundreds of labor compounds all along the border which in effect is little more than a line on the map The extensive range of commercial activity suggests that it would be wrong to think that Chinas leadership is now so annoyed with Kim Jong Un who took control of North Korea at the end of 2011 after the death of his father that it is tightening the economic screws on the young leader next doorThis is a very sensitive part of China  during a week of reporting along the North Korean border Washington Post reporters were monitored by police  and doing business with North Korea is a very sensitive subject The textile-factory manager would allow himself to be identified only as Mr Kim he and other North Korean businessmen who agreed to speak about their operations otherwise did so on the condition of anonymity for fear of jeopardizing their livelihoodsNorth Koreas economy is still a basket case barely more than one-fiftieth the size of South Koreas But in talking about the changes underway the businessmen described a North Korean economy that is increasingly run according to market principles where people want to be in business not the bureaucracy and where money talksMr Kim the textile manager said he has no qualms about making pants to be worn by men going to work in imperialist aggressor countries such as the United States South Korea or Japan  the three most hated enemies of his country He was only interested he said in maximizing profits for Pyongyang wherever they come fromIt doesnt matter whether theyre an enemy country or not Kim saidIn the clothing factory the women work 13 hours a day 28 or 29 days a month and are paid $300 each a month  one-third of which they keep The rest goes back to the government in PyongyangEven though I want to pay them more I have to send a certain amount home to my country so this is all I can give them Kim said in his office at the factory On his desk an open laptop revealed that visitors had interrupted his game of solitaireThe women work on the third floor wearing their coats inside to guard against the cold and live on the second floor in shared dormitory-style rooms decorated with a banner declaring Lets realize the revolutionary ideas of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il alongside portraits of the two former leaders grandfather and father respectively of Kim Jong Un Signs on the doors read Call each other comradeNorth Korea is thought to have at least 50000 workers outside the country earning money for the regime and 13000 of them work in DandongThis neon explosion of a city contrasts starkly with the North Korean city of Sinuiju on the opposite bank of the river where there is only a smattering of light at nightBut there are signs of large-scale construction on the North Korean side a half-completed apartment tower with a crane on the top and other new buildings underway Although the traffic crossing the bridge between the two cities is far from jammed it is constant A steady flow of vans and container trucks and the occasional black sedan with tinted windows crossed in both directions over the course of a weekPassenger and freight trains ran regularly carrying cargo such as steel bars for construction and unrefined gold dirtConsumer goods go in the other direction The most popular items to sell in North Korea these days are TV sets hooked up to solar panels  preferably with USB ports for watching smuggled dramasHere North Koreans are coming to grips with the fundamentals of capitalism even if they still wont use the termOver dinner one night at a Chinese restaurant another North Korean factory manager happily chatted about his corporate role models Chief among them the titans of South Korean conglomerates such as Samsung and Hyundai who propelled that countrys rapid economic transformationWhat had he learned from those tycoons in the SouthPerseverance the need to diversify said the businessman who manages a factory that produces goods related to the construction industry and was sporting a Tissot watch Were living in a world where new things keep appearing Who would have thought Nokia would have collapsed Their mistake was sticking with the same productHe has absorbed some of these lessons from the outside world describing steps he has taken to increase productivity at his factory  mainly by creating better working conditions so his employees want to work more  and boost his profitsThis is emblematic of the tentative economic experimentation taking place since Kim Jong Un became leaderReports from inside North Korea suggest that even state-run companies are increasingly operated according to market principles with managers empowered to hire and fire workers  previously unimaginable in the communist nation  and conduct businesses the way they see bestThere are frustrations here The biggest one  literally  has to be the four-lane $350million New Yalu River Bridge a huge steel structure that traverses the river from a glitzy urban development Dandong New DistrictThe whole development project is now on ice partly because of the  the businessman and uncle of Kim Jong Un who was executed at the end of 2013 partly because of his decadent capitalist lifestyle Since then Jangs colleagues have been recalled to Pyongyang or have disappeared  sometimes with millions of dollars in Chinese money according to businessmen hereBeijing is clearly none too happy about this and smaller Chinese operators also have complaints about dealing with North KoreaOne Korean Chinese businessman named Ri who exports raw materials from North Korea said there are lots of fraudsters thereSometimes the North Korean takes the money but then you cant find the person he said As the middleman I have to take responsibility for that There are some people here whove committed suicide because theyve lost everythingA well-to-do Chinese couple who run an exporting business in Dandong  she was carrying a Chanel bag he had an Armani sweater  could barely conceal their distaste for the state across the river They used to export kitchen goods to North Korea but have stopped saying it was too hard to make money thereAsked if they had seen signs that North Korea is opening up its economy the woman said Oh youre so naiveI havent seen any signs of that her husband chimed in We built this whole new bridge but North Korea hasnt built anythingBut while the political chill between North Korea and China might have had an impact on state-level economic cooperation and those who played in the big leagues with Jang might have been scared away there are still plenty of small businessmen looking for  and finding  ways to make moneyThese guys are out there to make a buck  theyre not the World Food Program  and as long as these opportunities exist private profit-seeking market-conforming trade and investment will continue said Marcus Noland an expert on the North Korean economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in WashingtonTake Zhang a Korean Chinese merchant who runs one of the 30 or so Chinese businesses in Dandong that ship fabric to North Korea to be turned into clothes there for European companies Zhang said that he employs a few dozen people on the Chinese side of the border but that his workforce in North Korea fluctuates between 3000 and 10000 people depending on how many orders he hasNorth Koreans are particularly good at painstaking manual work such as lace-making and hand-stitched beadwork He pulls out his smartphone and shows a photo of a blond woman wearing an intricately embroidered pink and white dress a product of North Korean laborZhang who speaks Korean and Chinese does not even need his passport to enter North Korea He has a permit that allows him to travel back and forth freely He talked about how hes developed good relations with his business partners thereOver the past few years Ive built trust with the North Koreans he said Every year around the birthdays of the leaders I go there in person and take fruit and flower baskets I pay my respects to the leaders and Im sure my clients report this back to the authoritiesFor North Koreans who make money on the Chinese side of the border one question is how to get it back to PyongyangSince the start of the Korean War in 1950 when it included North Korea in the Trading With the Enemy Act the United States has sought to restrict North Koreas ability to bank and tradeThis has tightened markedly over the past decade with the United States imposing rounds of sanctions designed to curtail North Koreas ability to procure materials for its nuclear weapons program by shutting the country out of the international financial system The latest measures were imposed in January as punishment for the The restrictions hurt at first But North Korea has wised up It uses small banks in China or Russia to transfer money  several banks in Dandong said it was possible to wire money to Pyongyang for a hefty commission  or simply reverts to old-fashioned suitcases full of cash which are much harder to stop with sanctionsThere is a sense in Dandong that sanctions are an issue for Washington and Beijing but that they dont apply here on the borderIm just a local businessman Zhang said adding that sanctions apply to big international companies not to private individuals like us clearly considering his business with North Korea domestic Anyway we find ways to get around themRi the Korean Chinese trader said that his business partners always want cashSo they come out or I go into North Korea to settle the bills he said in his office in Dandong running wooden beads through his fingers They like to be paid in US dollars euros Japanese yen (North Koreans returning to Pyongyang apparently like to carry American dollars for the cachet)Everyone interviewed said that it is entirely possible to send cash to North Korea  people usually just carry it in bags over the bridge  and that while there might technically be limits on how much a person can carry in practice there are no checks or at least no checks that cannot be overcome by greasing a few palmsBut the regime doesnt always want cash The North Korean businessmen who talked to The Post said they buy goods according to orders from Pyongyang and ship those back instead Recently they have been asked to send back solar panels and generators to help deal with North Koreas chronic electricity shortageRelations between China and North Korea are complicated but one thing is clear Politics and economics are not entirely intertwinedThere is a lot of jumping to conclusions in Washington and discussion about China showing a strong hand to North Korea said John Park a North Korea sanctions expert at MIT I dont see the evidence for thatAlthough trade appears to have dipped recently that is the result of sharp declines in prices of commodities such as coal and iron ore  two of North Koreas biggest exports to China  rather than some kind of punishment for Kims lack of deference to Xi Jinping the Chinese presidentThe young North Korean leader has not made the traditional pilgrimage to visit the states patronBut pragmatic China Park said does not want North Korea becoming unstable and risk unsettling this precarious northeastern part of ChinaAs you must have watched lots of historic soap operas in South Korea you will know that China and North Korea are like lips and teeth said the North Korean factory manager over dinner repeating an old saying about the neighbors Economically nothing has changed Yoonjung Seo and Hallie Gu contributed to this reportThey like fast fashion from Zara and H&M They work out to be seen as much as to exercise They drink cappuccinos to show how cosmopolitan they are Some have

Republic Were supposed to dress conservatively in North Korea so people like going to the gym so they can show off their bodies show some skin said Lee Seo-hyeon a 24-year-old who was until 18 months ago part of Pyongyangs brat packWomen like to wear leggings and tight tops  Elle is the most popular brand among women while men prefer Adidas and Nike  she said When young people go to China they travel armed with shopping lists from their friends for workout gearAt a leisure complex next to the bowling alley in the middle of Pyongyang they run on the treadmills which show Disney cartoons on the monitors or do yogaThe complex also has a fancy restaurant that advertises for wedding functions  glitzy venues cost as much as $500 an hour  and a coffee shop where most drinks are priced between $4 and $8 although an iced mocha costs $9Its a cool spot When youre in there it feels like you could be anywhere in the world said Andray Abrahamian who is British and helps run an exchange program that provides financial training to North Koreans He recently played squash on one of the three courts at the center Its not cheap Its a few dollars for a class Its definitely for people who have disposable incomeNorth Korea as a whole remains economically backward  industry has all but collapsed and even in Pyongyang the official salary remains less than $10 a month  but the rise in recent years of a merchant class has created a whole layer of nouveaux riches in the capital city Donju or masters of money have emerged with the tentative moves toward becoming a market economy that began about 15 years ago but has picked up momentum under Kim Jong Un the third-generation leader who took over the reins of North Korea at the end of 2011The donju usually hold official government positions  in ministries or the military running state businesses abroad or trying to attract investment into North Korea On the side they trade in everything they can get their hands on including flat-screen TVs and apartmentsThe money that they are making now flows through society through the markets that are present in every population center to the high-end restaurants of PyongyangKim Jong Un is very pro-market His policy has essentially been benign neglect said Andrei Lankov a Russian historian specializing in Korea who once studied in Pyongyang A number of North Korean capitalists Ive talked to say that theyve never had it so goodKim 33 has made it a high priority to improve the lives of his fellow millennials in particular He has ordered the construction of amusement parks and water parks and skate parks even a dolphinarium and a ski resort Around the capital volleyball and tennis courts are full of young peopleOn a trip to Pyongyang this month three Washington Post reporters went to a German-themed restaurant near the Juche Tower that had exposed brick walls and seven kinds of North Korean beer on tap A huge screen showed ice skatingOn the menu there was a prime steak with a baked potato for $48 although the Wiener schnitzel was more reasonable at $7 Most of the North Koreans in the restaurant seemed to be opting for the local food although at $7 for a bowl of bibimbap  the price youd pay in Seoul  it was hardly cheapAt the Sunrise complex theres a sushi bar and a barbecue restaurant where groups of North Koreans were enjoying grilled meat  the waitress recommended cuts of beef that were $50 for a one-person portion  and bottles of soju Koreans favorite alcoholic beverage on a recent Saturday nightA North Korean couple pulled the bamboo curtain across the front of their table when they heard foreigners arrive In Pyonghattan discretion is key If it werent for the little badges they could be South Koreans said one expat in Pyongyang referring to the pins of Kim Il Sung or Kim Jong Il the first two generations of leaders that North Koreans must wear over their hearts Theyre paying 10 to 15 euros for a meal he said He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the trouble his remarks could cause for himThere are other signs that more people have more disposable income Five or six taxi companies are operating  although the drivers grumble that business isnt great  and a reporter spotted several people with pet dogs something that wouldnt have been seen a few years agoWomen perhaps seeing a green light from Ri Sol Ju Kims

her brother Lee Hyeon-seung now 30 were part of this privileged setThey lived in China and went to a university there Their father a high-ranking North Korean official based in China was tasked with earning foreign currency for the regime But they traveled back and forth to PyongyangLee Hyeon-seung described his teenage life in Pyongyang one that involved listening to Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys in the days before the South Korean wave of K-pop and schmaltzy dramas had arrivedFor the average Pyonghattanite fast fashion from such brands as Uniqlo Zara and H&M is affordable and popular All my friends lived abroad and everyone would bring stuff like this back Lee Hyeon-seung saidBut there were limits Sleeveless tops and too-short skirts are out as is hair dyeIf your clothes are too radical or extreme or theyre not in line with North Korean style the police might take your name and then your name will be broadcast on the radio Lee Seo-hyeon said The siblings defected

the South has come to Pyongyang Double-eyelid operations  to give Asian eyes a more Western look  are derigeur as are nose jobs Doing your eyelids costs between $50 and $200 depending on the skill of the surgeonYou can get a visa to leave the country for medical reasons but plastic surgery is not considered a valid medical reason Lee Seo-hyeon said Being beautiful and being handsome are considered a competitive advantage But how much of the change is skin-deep and how much is realSo much of this development is about image Abrahamian said One woman who took part in his training program started a coffee shopThe coffee shops dont make much money Its just a signifier that youre fancy and cosmopolitan he saidOne of the most obvious changes has been the construction boom in the capitalThe high-rise apartment buildings that have popped up in the center of Pyongyang from the Changjon complex near Kim Il Sung Square to the Mirae Scientists Street look impressive from a distanceBut up close tiles are falling off buildings that are only a year old and electricity supply remains so patchy that the most-sought-after apartments are the ones on the lower stories Who wants a 20th-floor walk-upWith the Mirae Scientists Street complete Kim has ordered the development of Ryomyong Street named for the place where the dawn breaks in the Korean revolutionKim said the area would contain magnificent skyscrapers  one is planned to rise 70 stories  with eco-friendly design incorporating solar panels and greenhousesThese may all be part of a Potemkin village but they nonetheless underscore the fact that in North Korea poverty is no longer equally sharedThere is only one game in town said Lankov the historian CapitalismKim Jong Un the third generation of North Koreas ruling dynasty boasted Friday of magnificent and exhilarating advances in nuclear and missile capabilities this year as he convened the  in his lifetimeThe congress  the first held since 1980 three years before Kim was born  essentially amounts to an extravagant state-choreographed spectacle built around Kims leadershipThe intent was clear with each round of rapturous applause for the 33-year-old leader a display of loyalty and bolstered legitimacy for his rule even as North Koreas defiant policies bring further isolation and pressures  But Kim wasted no time in taking another swipe His bravado was aimed directly at the international community amid alarm over the Norths attempts at military and nuclear expansionIn this year of the seventh party congress the military and the people have accomplished great success in the first hydrogen bomb test and the launch of an Earth observation satellite  to brilliantly illuminate the prowess of Juche Korea Kim said referring to North Koreas unique ideology that translates as self-relianceUnprecedented results have been accomplished Kim wearing a Western-style suit and tie instead of his usual Mao suit told a packed audience in the ostentatious April 25 House of Culture in central PyongyangKim ordered North Koreas fourth nuclear test in January an event he hailed as historic in Fridays address Pyongyang claimed to have tested an exponentially more powerful hydrogen bomb but outside analysts said it appeared to have been a lesser atomic device similar to the Norths previous test   In February Kim then oversaw the launch of what authorities said was a rocket intended to put a satellite into orbit but outside analysts widely believe to be part of an intercontinental ballistic missile program aimed at enabling North Korea to potentially strike the continental United States But other launches since including two intermediate-range missile launches and another from a submarine were deemed by the United States and South Korea to have failed There was no mention of this in Kims triumphant address howeverStill Kims boasts seem to prove the theory that this years provocations  from the nuclear and missile tests to threats to blow up New York and Washington  were part of an effort to bolster the young leaders legitimacyHe followed the general outline of arent we great and paying tribute to his father and grandfather and to the Workers Party leadership said Michael Madden who runs the  blog He was saying we have a strong and prosperous fatherland and were not going to be bullied by big countriesThe authorities in Pyongyang allowed in about 130 foreign journalists including three from The Washington Post to cover the event apparently wanting to make sure their message was disseminated to a wide audience  But the journalists were not permitted to enter the building where the congress was being held Friday and were instead deposited by their government minders on a street corner some 300 yards from the red-festooned venueAfter an hour they were taken back to their hotel where state television was running dramas centered on revolutionary heroes Even as the congress continued across town the journalists were then taken to an electrical cable factoryIt wasnt until 10 pm that news of the congress was shown on television with Kims speech and the orchestrated cheering supplemented with photos of Kim in a variety of military situations looking happyDetails remain scarce It is not clear when the congress will end or what else will be on the agenda Thousands of people have been on the streets of Pyongyang in the rain practicing for a torchlight parade but no date for the event has been givenNorth Korea has placed huge importance on the congress Previous such events have served as forums to show the ruling partys strength and have occasionally been used as vehicles for major announcements Kim Il Sung the eternal president of North Korea and the grandfather of the current leader used the 1980 congress to unveil his son Kim Jong Il as his successor Kim Il Sung died in 1994 and Kim Jong Il in 2011Following in his grandfathers footsteps Kim Jong Un has elevated the status of the Workers Party and has effectively moved away from the military first policy promoted by his father by announcing a simultaneous push toward both nuclear and economic development  Analysts say that by calling the congress Kim is continuing this pattern of increasing the stature of the party while at the same time bolstering his claim on the leadership North Korea is home to the worlds only communist dynasty and Kim Jong Un was not even 30 when he became its third-generation leaderKorean culture is Confucian and places a premium on age and seniority but Kim is a good half-century younger than some of his advisers The regime also was unable to lay the kind of groundwork for the current leader that it did for Kim Jong IlKim Jong Il was in the public eye moving through a series of official

investigating allegations by two women who said the head of its news department made unwanted physical contact with them while he was employed by another news organization nearly two decades agoThe women both journalists at the time of the alleged incidents made the accusations in recent weeks against  senior vice president of news and editorial director at the Washington-based public broadcasting organizationIn response to the allegations NPR said Tuesday that it has placed Oreskes on indefinite leaveIn separate complaints the women said Oreskes  at the time the Washington bureau chief of the   abruptly kissed them while they were speaking with him about working at the newspaper Both of them told similar stories After meeting Oreskes and discussing their job prospects they said he unexpectedly kissed them on the lips and stuck his tongue in their mouths Both of the women spoke to The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity so as not to damage their employment prospectsThe alleged incidents occurred in the late 1990s the women said Oreskes after working at the Times and the Associated Press in senior editing rolesThe women spoke with NPRs attorney in charge of labor and employment matters in mid-October She sent the women emails acknowledging that the news organization was looking into the information they providedNPR didnt address any of the specific allegations when contacted by The Post for comment Instead it issued a statement reading We take these kinds of allegations very seriously If a concern is raised we review the matter promptly and take appropriate steps as warranted to assure a safe comfortable and productive work environment As a matter of policy we do not comment about personnel matters A spokeswoman Isabel Lara offered no further comment Oreskes didnt respond to multiple requests for commentThe 63-year-old editor is the latest media figure whose conduct has been called into question by women who worked for him or who sought employment when he was in a position to wield power over hiring and firing Allegations against former New Republic editor Leon Wieseltier and political journalist Mark Halperin have also come to light in the past monthBoth complainants say Oreskess alleged behavior had a lasting impactOne of the women said her encounter with him permanently damaged her confidence She was in her late 20s at the time recently arrived in Washington from a small Western town When I first went to see him it was after screwing up my nerve to try to be bold and maneuver myself into a better job and after what happened with him I never really tried that again she saidThe women said they met with Oreskes after he expressed an interest in reviewing their work and giving them career advice possibly with an eye toward hiring them as reporters Neither was ever hiredThe first woman said she met Oreskes at the Times offices in the Army and Navy Club Building in downtown Washington Afterward she said he took out a personal ad in the Washington City Paper aimed at her It read Saw you at the Army-Navy Building Loved hearing your life story and your ideas Hope you get this message Let me knowShe recounted that a week later he emailed her to ask why she hadnt responded to his ad The woman said she was unaware of it and had to search for it What was especially creepy about it was that he put it in the wrong place in the paper she said in an interview Instead of appearing in the Missed Connections section the ad was in a section called Adult Services that featured thinly disguised offers of prostitutionThereafter she said Oreskes invited her to have lunch in a room at the Watergate Hotel catered by room service She declined the offerShe nevertheless maintained contact with him hoping to keep her job prospects alive She says that when she mentioned to him that she was traveling to New York for a job interview at the New York Daily News he told her to book the flight he planned to take the same day They shared a cab into the city from the airport At the end of the trip he leaned against her kissed her and slipped his tongue into her mouth she saidThe worst part of my whole encounter with Oreskes wasnt the weird offers of room service lunch or the tongue kiss but the fact that he utterly destroyed my ambition she saidThe second woman recounted a similar sequence of events After booking him on a TV program that she was producing and mentioning that she wanted to return to print reporting he offered to review her published work They agreed to meet at a local restaurant but at the last minute Oreskes called and said he had a trip planned that day and was running late He asked to meet at her apartment She agreedThe apartment meeting went off without issue although the woman recalled feeling uncomfortable when Oreskes placed his hand in the small of her back as she showed him around her apartment She then offered to drive him to Reagan National Airport for his flight As she pulled to the curb Oreskes said goodbye then kissed her unexpectedly she saidI was frozen she recalled I was shocked I thought What just happened She said she drove 100 feet pulled over and called her boyfriend to tell him about the incidentLater she said she got a voice-mail message from Oreskes saying how much he enjoyed meeting her and that he looked forward to seeing her againAbout two months later she booked him on the TV program again and invited him to lunch She arranged to meet him at a restaurant in the center of Union Station I looked him in the eye and I said You kissed me and it was totally inappropriate Thats not the way I want to get ahead in this business His jaw dropped He said I was overcome with passion I couldnt help myselfNeither woman complained at the time both believed that their complaints would be ignored and would jeopardize any chance of working for the TimesBoth said they were motivated to come forward now by NPRs coverage of recent sexual harassment episodes especially those involving  The idea that hes in charge of that coverage is just so hypocritical to me one woman said Its sickening I want to say You owe me  a public apology You should recuse yourself from NPRs coverage of harassment Two people who worked at the Times with Oreskes around the late 1990s recalled that he focused extraordinary attention on another young woman who worked as a news aide in the Washington bureau I would call it pestering said one editor It made [the woman] really nervous There was excessive phone calling [by him to her] and messages that he wanted to meet her outside the officeThis account was confirmed by Jill Abramson who was Oreskess deputy at the time Abramson who went on to become and is now a columnist and  said in an interview that she regretted not confronting Oreskes about his behaviorIf I had to do it again I would have told him to knock it off said Abramson  about the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill harassment case I think I should have raised this with [the Times human resources department]  Maybe confronting him would have somehow stopped him from doing it to another womanAbramson said she hesitated in part because the young woman didnt want to raise the issue but did want Oreskess alleged behavior to stop But Abramson said I dont really feel it was in a gray area in retrospect I should have stopped himThe Times takes all allegations of sexual harassment seriously and we are looking into it a spokeswoman for the company saidEventually another editor passed the word to a senior editor in New York who gave Oreskes a father-son talking-to as one editor put it warning him to steer clear of the young woman The young woman eventually landed a job at another publication in WashingtonOne of the women who complained about Oreskes to NPR said she thought she saw him a few months ago at her gym for the first time in years I just about had a heart attack she said I fled the building feeling sick Im not sure I would want to talk to him long enough for him to apologize even if he wanted toThe latest Republican health-care bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act would eliminate funds for fundamental public health programs including for the prevention of bioterrorism and  as well as money to provide immunizations and heart-disease screeningsAs part of the the Prevention and Public Health Fund provides almost $1 billion annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Since 2010 the fund has been an increasingly important source of money for core CDC programs today accounting for about 12 percent of the CDCs total budgetThe GOP bill would  starting in October of next year No clear replacement has been proposedThis is about protecting Americans so this is about saving lives Anne Schuchat acting CDC director said in an interview Tuesday referring to the proposed elimination of the fund She and other public health experts held a briefing at the Capitol on Tuesday on the growing threat of An outbreak can happen anywhere she said Its not a red- or blue-state kind of thing And we want to sustain the defense of Americans health from these new emerging threatsThe CDCs former director Tom Frieden said that if the prevention funding is lost Americans will be at greater risk from vaccine-preventable disease food-borne infections and deadly infections contracted in hospitals  Most of the prevention and public health funds are sent to state and local health departments with more than $625 million distributed among the 50 states and the District of Columbia last year Public-health-advocacy groups and state and local public health officials are warning the Trump administration and Congress of what they describe as the disastrous consequences of eliminating the fund without a corresponding budget increase to compensate for the lossState and local public health officials plan to meet with members of Congress and administration officials this week to make the case for continued investments in public health and prevention Cuts in those funds combined with potential federal budget cuts at the CDC and other health agencies could amount to a catastrophic year for public health funding according to a statement from the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials which represents US public health agenciesMore than 500 public health organizations childrens advocacy groups universities and local health departments sent  to President Trump last week warning of the consequences of eliminating the prevention fund Advocates and public health officials are hopeful that the money will be replaced but there have been few indications that that is forthcomingWe havent heard that expressed by the leadership either in the House or Senate said John Auerbach president and chief executive of the Trust for Americas Health a public-health-advocacy organization that led the letter-writing effortMost of the attention of the ACA repeal has been on  he saidBut if the CDC loses close to $1 billion in prevention funding we will see the loss of very important services that Americans in every city and town across the country have come to rely upon Auerbach saidAmong the personnel and programs that receive money from the prevention fund are the front-line workers inwho must respond to a new scary germ and health departments across the country that help them detect respond to and control  Schuchat saidOne of the of the prevention fund is the CDCs immunization program which last year received $324 million The money is sent directly to states and local communities to improve immunization infrastructure such as registries that allow providers to know which patients have received what vaccines Money from the prevention fund accounted for about 40 percent of the CDCs total immunization program funding last yearLosing this funding would cripple CDCs ability to detect prevent and respond to  respiratory and related infectious diseases threats including pandemic influenza according an  on the impact of the prevention fundThe prevention fund also supports a CDC-led surveillance program to monitor children at highest risk for exposure For situations such as the recent lead-in-water crisis in Flint Mich its the tool that allows you to identify when theres a cluster of lead cases Auerbach saidsEarly on Monday morning  that Paul Manafort and his former business partner Rick Gates were turning themselves in to federal authorities to face charges related to special counsel Robert S Mueller IIIs investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 electionBelow an overview of why Manafort in particular may have been ensnared by Muellers investigationPaul Manafort is a longtime political consultant and lobbyist in Washington His career took two tracks that are important for understanding how we got to this pointThe first is that Manafort helped multiple Republican presidential nominees manage their efforts at their party conventions including Gerald Ford in 1976 Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 and George H W Bush in 1988 He also managed Bob Doles 1996 presidential bidThe second is that Manafort also worked on behalf of a number of questionable international actors including Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos and the Russia-backed president of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych Yanukovych was ousted in 2014 during the period in which Russia-Ukraine tensions spiked Much more on this below  In March 2016 as Donald Trump was trying to ensure his victory in the Republican nomination fight he hired Manafort to help corral delegates for the upcoming convention At the time you may remember there was a lot of talk about whether or not Republican delegates pledged to Trump would hold steady as the convention unfolded Manafort had  with that task in 1976 fending off a challenge from Reagan The recommendation to hire Manafort came from Trumps longtime ally Roger Stone whod formed a lobbying firm with Manafort after the 1980 electionManafort accepted a position with the Trump campaign for no salary Manaforts questionable business associations were well known but at the time Trump was still having trouble attracting top-tier Republican staffers who were skeptical that Trump was a viable candidateOnce on the campaign he butted heads with campaign manager Corey Lewandowski In late June Trumps children  convince him to oust Lewandowski and elevate Manafort who became campaign chairman He held that senior position with the campaign until August On the day he resigned former House speaker Newt Gingrich  Fox News Sean Hannity that nobody should underestimate how much Paul Manafort did to really help get this campaign to where it is right nowIn addition to hand-picking  Manafort led the effort to put down the rebellion at the convention By far most impt person in campaign John Weaver (@JWGOP) For this we need to talk a bit more about Manaforts backgroundIn 2006 Manaforts company (of which Gates was part) signed a multi-year agreement with a Russian oligarch named Oleg Deripaska apparently based on a  in which Manafort outlined a strategy that would greatly benefit the [Russian president Vladimir] Putin Government Deripaska is closely tied to PutinThat same year Manafort began working with Yanukovychs Party of Regions in Ukraine In 2010 Yanukovych was elected as that countrys president In 2014 he was ousted during a popular uprising in the country largely because of his sympathies for RussiaA ledger found in a former Party of Regions office in Kiev reported last year  that Manafort may have received nearly $13 million in off-the-record payments from the party during his time working with them Manafort denied the allegation but the Associated Press later  some of the paymentsAt the time Trump was facing  about his relationship with Russia and any financial ties to the country Revelation that his campaign chairman may have been paid by a Russian-backed political party helped spur Trump to oust Manafort from his positionNoIts important to remember that the investigation by Mueller is looking at Russian meddling in the 2016 election as well as any possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian agents But as an arm of the Justice Department Muellers team is also  to investigate any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigationThink about it this way If the police were called to your house to interview you about noise complaint and saw you standing over a dead body holding a knife that might also come up as a subject of conversationThe indictment includes 12 counts focused on a few things Misleading the government failing to register as a foreign agent laundering money and failing to report foreign incomeIt includes a conspiracy charge which is broadly about misleading the government including that Manafort (and Gates) provided false statements to investigators and failed to register as foreign agents (Manafort eventually did so  after his work with the campaign drew attention to himself) This is  a charge the Manafort conspired against the United States on behalf of Russia during the electionThe financial charges relate to $75 million that Manafort and Gates earned overseas $18 million of which was then allegedly laundered by Manafort This money was apparently largely earned through the pairs work in UkraineIts important to note that these investigations predate Manaforts time as head of the Trump campaign In 2014 the FBI began an investigation into Manafort including  (That same year Deripaska accused Manafort and Gates of  from him that was meant to be invested in a cable network in Ukraine) The investigation into Manafort was restarted in the  of last year BuzzFeed  that the FBI is investigating wire transfers that were made in 2012 and 2013 In other words even had he not worked with Trumps campaign Manafort might have faced an indictment like this anywayThe main caveat worth remembering here is that Manafort was out of the campaign by August  meaning that he wasnt there for the closing days of Trumps effort That said there are two ways in which Manafort and Russian interests overlapped during his time on the campaignThe first relates to Deripaska the Putin-allied oligarch Shortly after Manafort started with the campaign he emailed a business partner in Ukraine and asked how his new position  to get whole asking if Deripaskas team was aware of his new position Later in the campaign Manafort sought to pass word to Deripaska that a  on the campaign might be possible It doesnt seem to have happened(Worth noting During the campaign the Trump campaign  then managed by Manafort  worked to  in the party platform about arming Ukraine in its efforts against Russia)Manafort was also one of the participants in the infamous Trump Tower meeting set up by Donald Trump Jr and involving a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer who was offering dirt on Hillary Clinton During that meeting Trump Jr described Manafort as being on his phone the whole time hinting that the content was not interesting to the campaign chairman Later though Manafort turned over  from the meeting that hed taken on his phoneIt is possible that the Manafort indictment is meant to serve as leverage in Muellers broader investigation There is no mention in the indictment of Trump In 2006 Manafort bought a condominium in Trump Tower Other New York real estate Manafort  in 2012 is listed in the indictment because the money used to buy the properties wasnt included in his tax returnsMore charges could be filed against Manafort in the futureTrump has a pattern of continuing to talk with people hed once hired on the campaign even if theyd been fired Its not clear if that was maintained with Manafort though Manafort did  former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus shortly before Trumps inauguration The Daily Beast  in June that Gates was a regular visitor to the White House working with Trump ally Tom Barrack (Barrack recently  over Trumps presidency in an interview with The Post)Below our interactive timeline of how and when Russia and the Trump campaign may have intersectedA few years before he became Donald Trumps campaign chairman longtime Republican political operative Paul Manafort went on a spending spree with money funneled through a network of offshore bank accounts a federal indictment unsealed Monday alleges He bought a $15 million brownstone in a trendy New York neighborhood and a $19million home in Arlington Va He paid for three Range Rovers and a Mercedes-Benz landscaping at his Hamptons getaway and pricey improvements at his house in Palm Beach Fla In all out of more than $75million that flowed through the offshore accounts more than $18 million was laundered with income concealed from the US government and was used in part to cover Manaforts lavish lifestyle the indictment says The indictment of the refined and impeccably dressed former campaign chairman detailed an alleged scheme in which foreign clients paid millions in exchange for Manaforts consulting services Manaforts lawyer Kevin Downing rebutted the charges Monday saying Manafort was not seeking to launder funds Manafort a confidant of presidents dating back to George HW Bush and Ronald Reagan was the biggest name charged thus far in a federal investigation by special counsel Robert S Mueller III who is examining possible collusion by Trumps campaign with Russia Manaforts indictment along with charges against his former business partner Rick Gates who also worked for the Trump campaign brought Mueller close to the inner circle that guided Trumps 2016 victory Manafort and Gates pleaded not guilty and did not speak to reporters This indictment is tragic for Paul and his family said Manaforts former business partner Charles Black who said he couldnt speak to the specifics because he hasnt worked with Manafort for two decades For him and Rick Gates I just pray that they are innocent Manafort was brought into Trumps presidential campaign in spring 2016 tasked with tracking delegates before becoming chairman The arrival of a seasoned operative had been welcomed at the time by many Republican leaders as a sign that Trump was ready to professionalize a largely undisciplined campaign as he was preparing to secure the GOP nomination But the court papers unsealed Monday show how Trump in tapping Manafort also brought aboard a senior strategist with deep ongoing and potentially problematic foreign entanglements  For decades Manafort has been known for his dealings with foreign leaders including some with less-than-savory reputations In recent years in addition to his work for Trump and for a Ukrainian presidential candidate he has made deals with foreign business titans that have resulted in controversy including one with a Russian oligarch who charged that Manafort and Gates disappeared without paying money they allegedly owed him Manafort and Gates denied the allegation Manaforts journey from being one of Washingtons most sought-after political operatives to defendant in a high-profile federal investigation is a story of a chase for power and money Manafort 68 was raised in Connecticut the son of the mayor of New Britain With a Georgetown University law degree he worked for President Gerald Fords 1976 campaign tracking delegates at the nominating convention He ran Ronald Reagans 1980 presidential campaign in the South Manaforts ascendancy in Washington reached new heights when he became a founding partner in 1980 of the lobbying firm Black Manafort & Stone with Black and Roger Stone the latter a longtime Trump confidant During Manaforts 16 years at the firm his clients included two dictators Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire (now Congo) and Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines who allegedly stole billions of dollars from their countriesIn 1989 Manafort testified before Congress about a deal in which he lobbied to obtain $43million in federal housing subsidies for a New Jersey project while his firm held an option to buy a stake in the property The firm invested before the subsidies were awarded but Manafort testified that he had a high degree of expectation that they would win approval The technical term for what we do and what law firms associations and professional groups do is lobbying Manafort said For purposes of today I will admit that in a narrow sense some people might term it influence peddlingManaforts globe-trotting lifestyle led friends to dub him the Count of Monte Cristo a reference to the swashbuckling hero of a 19th-century French novel Manafort later became a partner in the firm of Davis Manafort which Manafort owned with Richard Davis As a partner Manafort wooed a Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska Manafort and Davis had proposed setting up a $200million private equity fund to invest mostly in Russia and Ukraine according to a petition filed by Deripaska one of a number of fund contributors Derispaka invested in the partnership through a company called Surf Horizon incorporated in Cyprus in 2007 Deripaska sought repayment of some of his investment after the 2007 financial crisis saying in a petition that he was owed $19million from a failed investment in Ukraine Deripaska said in a 2014 petition that he was still waiting to be paid but it appears that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates have simply disappeared Deripaskas representative said in 2016 they were still seeking the money but a Manafort spokesman subsequently told the New York Times that no funds were owed During his time at the Trump campaign Manafort sought to communicate with Deripaska through an intermediary suggesting that his new position provided an opportunity to settle financial disputes according to Manaforts email correspondence which was turned over to investigators this year A turning point for Manafort came in the early 2000s when he became a consultant for Viktor Yanukovych who would later become Ukraines president One of Yanukovychs supporters was a Ukrainian energy tycoon   and Manafort soon tried to do business with him according to a filing in a now-dismissed lawsuit In 2008 Manafort met with Firtash to discuss a proposal to build an $850 million 65-story apartment building in New York City A lawsuit filed by former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko alleged that Firtash worked with Manafort to invest illicit profits from energy deals in Ukraine Firtash and Manafort denied the allegations and the suit was ultimately dismissed Spokesmen for Deripaska and Firtash did not respond to requests forcommentGates 45 met Manafort when he interned at his firm Black Manafort & Stone Manafort accompanied by Gates worked for Yanukovych and his Party of Regions as Yanukovych won the presidency of Ukraine in 2010 While Manafort said he was working for a pro-Western politician who embraced democracy Yanukovych was ultimately seen as aligned with Russian President Vladimir Putin Between 2012 and 2014 Manaforts firm was paid $17 million by the Party of Regions according to Manaforts belated filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act As part of Mondays indictment Manafort and Gates were accused of hiding their lobbying work for Ukraine in violation of the registration requirements The following year in 2015 Manafort owned an apartment at Trump Tower in New York City and had invested in other properties By early 2016 Manafort wanted to join Trumps presidential campaign He hadnt been in close touch with Trump for years so he sought out one of Trumps oldest and closest friends Thomas J Barrack Jr to serve as a conduit Barrack and Manafort were also longtime friends Barrack a billionaire who runs a real estate investment company said in a recent interview that the only financial deal he had ever made with Manafort was around 2004 when he lent $15 million for a house owned by Manaforts wife Barrack said the loan was paid back at market rate in 14 months Shortly after Trump lost the Iowa caucuses Manafort met Barrack at the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills Paul came to me and said I really need to get to [Trump] I think I can be really effective at the convention Barrack said  Barrack said in the interview that he sent materials about Manafort to Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner and Kushners wife Ivanka Trump Barrack had known both of them for years In the email Barrack wrote that Manafort would be a killer at the job Trump agreed to hire Manafort who said he would work without pay Manafort subsequently became campaign chairman During his time in the position Manafort attended a June 9 2016 meeting with Kushner and Donald Trump Jr at which a Russian lawyer was said to have damaging information about Hillary Clinton The meeting is not mentioned in the indictment but it has been a focus of Muellers investigation into whether Russia colluded with the Trump campaign Manafort resigned in August 2016 after reports of his ties to Yanukovych and the publication of a ledger in Ukraine that showed millions of dollars of supposedly off the books payments to Manafort from the Party of Regions a claim Manafort has denied Barrack invited Manafort to join him on his yacht off the coast of Greece He got fired and I felt terrible Barrack said When Manafort called he was depressed I said I have got five guys on a boat and Join us He came over and he spent four or five days figuring out what he would do nextBarrack subsequently hired Gates for two positions first to be deputy chairman of the Presidential Inaugural Committee of which Barrack was chairman and second as a Washington-based consultant of his company Colony NorthStar Gates remained in the latter position until the time of the indictment when his contract with the company was terminated according to an official familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasnt authorized to speak publicly During their work in Ukraine starting in 2008 Manafort and Gates allegedly devised a scheme to defraud banks and other institutions by wiring money to accounts in a way that laundered the funds without paying taxes Details of Manaforts luxurious lifestyle and income were spread on social media in February when hackers exposed a cache of more than 285000 personal messages purportedly stolen from the iPhone of Manaforts daughter Andrea Manaforts spokesman previously confirmed that the phone was hacked and that some of the texts placed on line were authentic but he has declined to authenticate the entire cache In one of the posted text messages Andrea Manafort wrote to her sister in 2015 Dont fool yourself The

President Trump about Russian hackers scaled a White House fence Friday night and neared an entrance to the presidential mansion before he was arrested according to a court documentThe suspect  identified as Jonathan Tuan-Anh Tran 26  made it all the way to the exterior of the White House which he walked alongside and then hid behind a pillar before he was spotted and apprehended near the South Portico entranceThe court document released Saturday evening omits any reference to alarms sounding and suggests that the first realization of an intruder was when a uniformed agent saw the suspect up to 200 yards from where he entered The US Secret Service declined to answer questions about how the man penetrated so deep onto the White House grounds citing an ongoing investigationIn a brief statement earlier Saturday the agency said the suspect had breached the outer perimeterA DC Superior Court judge ordered Tran detained through the weekend He was charged with entering restricted grounds while carrying a dangerous weapon Tran is expected to appear in federal court Monday He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted The charges were upgraded from his initial arrest for unlawful entryTrans court-appointed attorney Gregg D Baron asked that his client be released But Judge Jennifer DiToro ruled him a flight and safety risk Tran appeared wearing a blue zip-up sweatshirt khaki jeans a white T-shirt and glasses He made no public statementA federal law enforcement official said Tran has no prior criminal record and had no previous history with the Secret Service The official spoke on the condition of not being named to discuss information about the suspect that is not usually made public by police Tran is from Milpitas just outside San JoseTran told a Secret Service officer that he has been called schizophrenic according to the criminal complaint He had the Mace in a jacket pocket and a book bag with a book on Trump a US passport and an Apple laptop the

been followed and that his phone and email were being read by othersPresident Trump who was in the residence at the time of the breach said the Secret Service service did a fantastic job last night and he described the suspect as a troubled personSurveillance video showed Tran jumping a fence near the Treasury Building on East Executive Avenue He was arrested about 1138 pm According to the criminal complaint Tran told the arresting officer I am a friend of the president I have an appointmentFriday nights fence jumper is believed to be the first since Trump took office In the previous two years many people tried or succeeded in getting into one of the most secure residences in the world Last year the Secret Service added small spikes  or pencil points  to the top of the six-foot fence that surrounds the White House complex The agency also announced a plan to raise the height of the fence to 11 feet by 2018Perhaps the most serious breach was on Sept 19 2014 when Omar Gonzalez climbed over the north fence and made his way deep into the White House When he was finally tackled by an off-duty Secret Service agent in the ornate East Room he was found to have a knife in a pants pocket Two hatchets a machete and 800 rounds of ammunition were found in his car nearby Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned two weeks laterAfter that incident the Department of Homeland Security flagged as a serious concern that not all officers on the complex were aware or heard the alarm that should have alerted them to a jumper crossing the fence line In that case a fence alarm did sound but several radio and communication failures prevented some officers from hearing itRecently departed Secret Service director Joseph Clancy had pledged to fix the vulnerabilities that

checks of the candidates who ran for president during the 2016 election cycle has noted that in many ways it was an unbalanced race  but didnt go so far as to endorse the term post-truthI have never been a fan of the word post-truth since its a facile way to describe basic human behavior since the first words were spoken The Fact Checkers Glenn Kessler said in an email People have always been swayed by emotions and personal beliefs As fact checkers we give people the factual information and context for statements made by politicians What people do with those facts is up to them  The Fact Checkers Michelle Ye Hee Lee noted that of the blogs 314 fact checks for this election 168 were about claims made by Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton And ofTrumps average Pinocchio rating was 34breaking Rep Michele Bachmanns previous worst Pinocchio average of 308 in 2012Clinton on the other hand ended up with an average Pinocchio rating of 22 putting her in the same range as President Obama and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney she saidAnd what did people do with these facts They elected Trump the 45th president of the United StatesFor what its worth post-truth is not to be confused with truthiness a subtly different term that described the phenomenon of Now Im sure some of the word police the wordinistas over at Websters are gonna to say hey thats not a word said Colbert in the 2005 segment that introduced the word Well anybody who knows me know that Im no fan of dictionaries or reference books Theyre elitist Constantly telling us what is or isnt true or what did or didnt happenAt the time Colbert was still playing an exaggerated caricature of a conservative political-show hostWhos Britannica to tell me the Panama Canal was finished in 1914 he continued in the segment If I want to say it happened in 1941 thats my  I dont trust books Theyre all fact no heartMerriam-Webster made truthiness its 2006 word of the yearAnd if anything the rise of truthiness cleared the path for post-truth as in In a post-truth world truthiness is all that mattersGiven that usage of the term hasnt shown any signs of slowing down I wouldnt be surprised if post-truth becomes one of the defining words of our time said Grathwohl the Oxford Dictionaries presidentEach year the Oxford staff selects hundreds of words then narrows that list down through discussions about what words are going to best highlight the ways in which the English lexicon is changing in response to current events said Martin Oxfords head of US dictionariesThis year the shortlist included adulting (often packaged into the phrase adulting so hard as in Im adulting so hard that I bought a leaf blower and increased my contribution to my 401(k) retirement savings plan) and which refers to a comfortable conviviality and feeling of contentment central to Danish culturePost-truth also beat out finalist alt-right a shortening of alternative right defined by Oxford as an ideological grouping associated with extreme conservative or reactionary viewpoints characterized by a rejection of mainstream politics and by the use of online media to disseminate deliberately controversial contentUse of alt-right in 2016 has increased dramatically as well in large part because of Trumps ties to prominent alt-right figures such as This years discussion was a bit more serious and somber  than it has been in some other years Martin saidFor those who have forgotten the Oxford Dictionaries  specifically this one The Oxford Dictionaries usually announces the word of the year in mid-November But Martin noted there was still time for the mood to shift during the end of the yearWho knows what will happen in the last [weeks] of 2016 she said Hopefully something really wonderful that gives us another ideaLast week Tony Podesta an eminence in the annals of Washington lobbying threw one of his signature events a big birthday bash at his stately stone manse in Kalorama His guests thought he was on top of his world one of the men who makes the city goOn Monday hours after the first indictments in the investigation into ties between President Trumps campaign and the Russian government Podesta abruptly quit his post atop the Podesta Group the capitals eighth-wealthiest lobbying firm Podestas departure came as and his business partner Rick Gates raised questions about the work Podestas firm did with Manafort to buff the image of the Ukrainian government Podesta 74 said he was quitting because of the barrage of criticism hes been getting as special counsel Robert S Mueller III pursues the investigationIt is impossible to run a public affairs firm while you are under attack by Fox News and the right wing media Podesta told employees at the Podesta Group offices on Monday according to a person familiar with his remarksFor decades Tony and John Podesta  brothers who share a Jesuit education a devotion to liberal causes and a passion for politics  have been central players in Washington And in the past year both have been drawn into the orbit of scandals Tonys Podesta Group is one of two firms described in Mondays indictment as having been recruited by Manafort and Gates to lobby on behalf of Viktor Yanukovych the former president of Ukraine who  according to people familiar with the companys involvement Federal prosecutorsManafort of creating a scheme to mislead the government about his secret work for a Ukrainian political leaderBoth the Podesta Group and the other firm Mercury Public Affairs have said they were hired to lobby for a European nonprofit based in Brussels trying to polish Ukraines image in the West But behind the scenes prosecutors allege the real client was a political party led by the former Ukraine president who was friendly with RussiaJohn Podesta a longtime Democratic adviser who led the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton has spent the past year coping with the publication by Wikileaks of tens of thousands of his emails which were hacked by someone using a computer with an address in Ukraine The release of those emails ensnared him in the ornate conspiracy theory  in which some anti-Clinton activists came to believe without evidence that sexually abused children were being hidden below a pizza place in Northwest Washington  and that John Podesta was involved with satanic rituals there a notion that police said was bogusIn an emailed statement Monday John Podesta said I view being attacked by Donald Trump and right wing media as a badge of honor To their opponents the Podestas are quintessential swamp rats exemplars of the permanent Washington establishment Their defenders however view them as the oil that makes the gears of government turnAdvocacy is an important part of our process and its an honorable profession said former senator Tom Daschle (D-SD) now a lobbyist Both Podestas have been enormously successful but were in as toxic an environment as anyone living today has ever seen The quality of governance has suffered immensely as a result The brothers although close are quite differentTony is more gregarious and outgoing and John is more introspective and quiet but they are brothers and they are still close said Ron Klain who was chief of staff to vice presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore John is the eminence grise of the Democratic Party and all the efforts by Republicans and completely crazy people to discredit him have not changed thatTony Podesta has been a pivotal figure in the murky connections between policy and politics becoming wealthy on fees from industries and foreign entities that want something from Congress and the White House He also bundles big donations and dispenses them to politicians who might someday be helpful to those lobbying clientsHe and his former wife Heather Podesta held lavish fundraisers for Democratic candidates at their home which boasted a world-class art collection and a wine cellar with thousands of bottles The Podesta brothers mother made the pesto Tony dressed the part of a man in full he sported eye-catching neckties and red Prada loafers The pope wears Prada he once told a reporter and so do I(Heather and Tony several years ago according to court records and news reports they spent 109 hours with a mediator before coming to a settlement on how to divide their art and other properties)Although the brothers created their lobbying firm together in 1988 John Podesta has spent most of his career inside government He had several jobs in Congress and was President Bill Clintons chief of staff and counselor to President Barack Obama Theyre brothers but they chose different roads to go down to craft good public policy said Rep Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn) who knows both Podestas Tony Podesta worked on a string of losing Democratic presidential campaigns  from Eugene McCarthys 1968 bid on through Hubert Humphrey Ed Muskie George McGovern Ted Kennedy Walter Mondale and finally Michael Dukakis in 1988Thats when the brothers created Podesta Associates which became the Podesta Group representing some of the countrys biggest and most powerful businesses including Walmart Bank of America and BP (The Washington Post employed the firm in the early 2000s when it was part of a public company controlled by the Graham family then-owners of The Post)The Podesta Group collected $252 million in fees over the past two decades according toThis year the firms top clients are Mylan a pharmaceutical company Wells Fargo Crawford Group the parent of Enterprise car rentals and Lockheed Martin the defense contractor according to federal recordsAlong the way the firm also represented a number of foreign entities including the government of Egypt under ex-dictator Hosni MubarakMore and more foreign countries turn to lobbyists to do work that diplomats once did themselves said James Thurber a government professor at American University who studies lobbying Things have gotten so much more complex in the last thirty years in the business that foreign companies and foreign countries do in WashingtonMondays indictments described a multitiered arrangement in which Manafort and Gates are alleged to have pulled the strings as the other firms cited only as Company A and Company B were the publicly acknowledged lobbyists for the Brussels group Sources familiar with the two companies work said the descriptions in the indictment indicate that Company A was Mercury and Company B was the Podesta GroupThe Podesta Group has fully cooperated with the Special Counsels office and taken every possible step to provide documentation that confirms compliance with the law said Molly Levinson a spokeswoman for the firm She said the work the firm did was in support of Ukraines admission to the [European Union] and the Brussels group certified that it was neither funded by nor directed by a government or political partyMichael McKeon a partner at Mercury said his firm disclosed that it worked for the Brussels group with the intention of aligning Ukraine with western democracies generally and the European Union specificallyIn 2012 when Manafort and Gates first sought out the two firms to lobby for their business associate in Ukraine Gates wrote to Mercury that the firm would be representing the Government of Ukraine in DCDays after Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election he summoned Preet Bharara to Trump Tower The president-elect wanted to talk to the US attorney for the Southern District of New York about his futureAfterward Bharara  one of the most influential prosecutors in the country best known for going after Wall Street as well as members of both political parties  told reporters hed been asked whether he wanted to stay onThe President-elect asked presumably because hes a New Yorker and is aware of the great work that our office has done over the past seven years asked to meet with me to discuss whether or not Id be prepared to stay on as the United States attorney to do the work as we have done it independently without fear or favor for the last seven years Bharara said in a brief statement to reporters after meeting with Trump  Three months later Bharara is suddenly out of a job part of an ouster of 46 US attorneys appointed by President Barack ObamaBhararato tender his resignationIt was an abrupt end to Bhararas nearly-eight-year tenure prosecuting powerful people in finance and politicsI did not resign Moments ago I was fired Being the US Attorney in SDNY will forever be the greatest honor of my professional life Preet Bharara (@PreetBharara) In 2015  described Bharara as the most powerful prosecutor in the country for whom no target is apparently too big Bharara also had developed a reputation for wit and outspokenness FBI director James B Comey said the impression he gave was if Jon Stewart was a prosecutorBhararas style drew appreciation from some legal scholars but also reprimands from others for showboating as Jenkins reportedOnce Bharara opened a speaking engagement before a roomful of financial traders by saying I just want to apologize in advance that I dont have enough subpoenas for all of you As the audience broke out in laughter he said Im just kidding Pause I do have enoughDuring his tenure Bharara has indicted 17 prominent New York politicians for malfeasance  10 of them Democrats Jenkins reported He also investigated New York Gov Andrew M Cuomo after he closed an ethics commissionIn 2012 he was named one of Time Magazines most influential people The write-up  a conservative legal scholar and an old buddy of BhararasWithout drama his Manhattan team has battled terrorism convicting the Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad crippled international criminal networks run by Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout Jamaican drug trafficker Christopher Coke and Colombian rebel group FARC and in March secured a half-billion-dollar forfeiture from computer contractor SAIC in the biggest fraud ever against New York City Those are good cases well prosecutedBharara was an outspoken man in a job that has been held by vocal and politically aspirant predecessors including former New York Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani and ComeyAlong with his bipartisan prosecutions Bharara developed a reputation for being tough on insider trading although he was criticized for the lack of prosecutions that followed the financial crisis Bharara defended himself saying it was far harder to jail independent business executives because they had consulted attorneys every step of the wayIt is a very difficult thing to put a person in jail when they say I asked my lawyers to do the best they could and tell me what Im supposed to do and they are independent and they were paid a fee Bharara said in 2014  So those are among the various obstacles you have  By then  were pondering Bhararas ambitions for higher office Bharara insisted he had none  and in many other interviews had given every indication that he intended to stay in prosecution for the long haul In the early days of the presidential primary race  he would do his job forever if I couldI mean look  I care about public service I care about honest government Bharara  Im a prosecutor Im a lawyer This is what I plan to do for a long timeHe also half-jokingly told Melber that it took some time for his parents who immigrated to the United States from India with nothing to appreciate his new jobAs I joked theyve finally gotten over the fact that their Indian American son didnt become a doctor Bharara told Melber But it took you know doing all of this before they finally realized Okay I guess its not a bad gigAlthough Bhararas future political aspirations remain unclear one thing is certain  the former US attorney wont be able to become presidentBharara was born in Firozpur in Punjab India and migrated with his family to the United States as a toddler His father moved the family to Buffalo after he was granted a fellowship to practice medicine  They eventually settled in New Jersey and Bharara went on to attend Harvard then Columbia Law SchoolHis Indian heritage made him a unique target for critics who called him out for arresting and charging Indian nationalsAs Jenkins notedBhararas heritage did not prevent him from arresting and charging Indias deputy consul general Indian diplomats reacted with outrage calling him a self-loathing traitor to his heritage and an embarrassed State Department had to bail out Khobragade with diplomatic immunityEveryone should understand that our motivation is always to do the right thing and we dont pull our punches and we dont care who you are Bharara says unapologeticallyBharara  that a lot of people in the country of my birth for whatever reason began to think that it was something having to do with me personally even though had they inquired a little bit would have discovered that this office brings cases based on the facts and the law And it doesnt matter you know who you are and what you look like and where youre fromHis own parents he once told Melber wouldnt talk explicitly about public service when we were growing up But it was very clear that they thought it was important to give back And maybe its you know common for immigrant families who got so much from America that they think thatPresident Trumpis expected to nominate Jerome H Powell as the next chair of the Federal Reserve according to two people familiar with the presidents decision who spoke on the condition of anonymityThe White House intends to announce the Fed chair selection on ThursdayIf confirmed by the SenatePowell would begin serving as chair in February replacing Janet L Yellen a Democrat whom Trumphas at times praisedbut many Republicans wanted replacedPowell a Republicanis widely viewed as a safe pick who is unlikely to make any dramatic changes to the Feds handling of the economy at a time when the stock market is soaring and unemployment is at a 16-year lowUnlike some of the other candidates Trump considered Powell has been supportive of Yellens policy of slowly raising interest rates which have been at historic lows for nearly a decade as the Fed looked to help the economy recover from a massive recession Trump has expressed interest in keeping rates low as he aims to stimulate the economy and get more Americans higher-paying jobsTrump said Friday he has someone very specific in mind for the FedIt will be a person who hopefully will do a fantastic job Trump said in a short video message posted on Instagram and TwitterThe Fed operates independently from the White House Much as with Supreme Court nominees once Powell is confirmed Trump will not have any sway over him making the choice a critical one because the Fed has the power to help stimulate the economy or slow it downif the central bank governors believe the economy is heating up too quicklyThe chairman of the Federal Reserve has control of the most powerful lever to influence world prosperity says Gary Richardson professor of economics at the University of California at Irvine and the former officialFed historian Ifthe chair makes good decisions about interest rates billions of people around the world will be better off If the chair makes mistakes he or she can put hundreds of millions of people out of work around the globePowell is no stranger to the Fed and the important role it serves at the heart of theglobal economy Hes served as a Fed governor a top leadership role within the central bank since 2012 He also has deep experience on Wall Street and in Washington Early in his career he served as undersecretary of the US Treasury Department for former president George HW Bush Then he became a partner at private equity firm The Carlyle Group amassing a sizable fortune of between $20 million and $55 million that allowed him to then take a job working for $1 as an expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center after he left the investment firmAlthough Powell has long been a Republican former colleagues at the Fed and Bipartisan Policy Center describe him as right-leaning but not an ideologuePresident Barack Obama originally nominated Powell to the Fed board Powell studied law at Georgetown University not economics but many say he has become well versed inmacroeconomics in his time at the FedWhen he showed up at the Fed he basically did not know much about macroeconomics or monetary policy says Seth Carpenter chief US economist at UBS who spent 15 years at the Fed including time overlapping with Powell He made a conscious decision to spend a lot of time with staff and colleagues to learn as deeply and completely as possiblePowell has developed a reputation in Washington as a consensus builder who studies issues extensively before making decisions He never dissented on any of the Feds decisions in his time on the board opting instead to try to work behind the scenes when he felt it was important to sway the course of actionPeople familiar with Trumps thinking on selecting Powell who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the president felt Powell would bring stability and continuity to the Fed because so many know him there already but Powell was also likely to help pull back some regulations on financial institutionsTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin pushed hard for Trump to select Powellafter working with him recently toreview ways to roll back regulations on financial firms a goal of the Trump administration In public speeches Powell has indicated he thinks that regulations put in place after the financial crisis went too farMost on Wall Street welcomed the news that Powell is the likely nominee Investment bank Deutsche Bank put out a note last week to clients saying Powell would be the best choice if Trump did not want to keep Yellen onBut some liberal groups including Fed Up were disappointed arguing the selection of Powell is an attempt to make the Fed morefavorable to big banksJerome Powells most important qualification is that he served with Janet Yellen His confirmation should depend on his willingness to follow in Yellens footsteps on both monetary and regulatory policy said Shawn Sebastian co-director of Fed Up a campaign from the Center for Popular DemocracyWhen Kim Young-sam became South Koreas first democratically elected civilian president in 1993 he vowed to cure the country of the Korean disease the political corruption that had become endemicKim oversaw an ambitious drive to clean up the country even authorizing the arrest of his two immediate predecessors on corruption-related charges although he eventually became infected by the disease himself when his son was arrested on corruption and bribery chargesCorruption bribery embezzlement and the abuse of power have been modulated over the past generation but remain indisputable components of official South Korea as the scandal now engulfing President Park Geun-hye showsPark is set to be questioned by prosecutors as soon as Thursday about her role in an influence-peddling scandal revolving around a friend of 40 yearsAlthough every South Korean president since democratization in 1987 has become ensnared by corruption in one way or another Park will become the first incumbent to be grilled by prosecutors She cannot be charged while in office but could be indicted after she leaves which may happen sooner than expectedMost analysts had thought Park would try to ride out the storm until the next election in December 2017But after a third week of huge protests  hundreds of thousands gathered in central Seoul on Saturday drawing comparisons to the demonstrations that ended military rule almost 30 years ago  the chances of her being forced out of office have increased Eurasia Group a consulting firm that assesses risk now puts the probability at 70percent   The situation has reached a point of no return Moon Jae-in an opposition politician and presidential hopeful said Tuesday Up to then he had demanded that she hand over day-to-day running of the country to the prime minister chosen by parliament But now he said that was no longer sufficient I along with the citizens will carry out a nationwide campaign for Parks resignation until she declares she will unconditionally step aside he saidThe scandal flared last month when it emerged that Park widely considered a distant figure was being secretly advised by a friend of 40 years a woman with no policy background but with ties to a religious cultThe woman Choi Soon-sil is accused of receiving classified information and of using her ties to Park to raise up to $70million from big business groups for two foundations  most of which she is said to have siphoned off  and to get her daughter into a prestigious university She is in custody and is expected to be indicted this weekParks attempts at quelling the public fury over this shadow president have amounted to nothing as shown by the increasingly large protests against herThe scandal has highlighted just how prevalent the Korean disease remainsIt encompasses the presidential Blue House with some of Parks aides suspected of helping Choi raise money and big business with Samsung alone said to have given $20million directly to Choi or to her foundations Senior officials from big conglomerates including Samsung Hyundai Motors and LG have been called in for questioning This adds to the woes at Samsung already reeling from the withdrawal of one its flagship products the Galaxy Note 7 phoneIt also involves the powerful prosecutors office which is accused of being too political A prominent former prosecutor who served as a senior presidential secretary to Park is now under investigation on suspicion of helping Choi and tipping off big businesses to pending raids And hard-charging prosecutors often end up working in the Blue House or at the big conglomerates further cementing personal links between institutions   Stephan Haggard professor of Korea-Pacific studies at the University of California at San Diego said the scandal is bigger than WatergateIts the scope of the violations that are in play he said Theres the classified information the foundations the university There are half a dozen discrete things that are likely to be illegalRa Jong-yil a former deputy director of South Korean intelligence also sees echoes of the Watergate scandal The easiest way to fix this is for the president to resign just like Nixon did Ra saidThe kind of corruption seen in South Korea is partly the result of government-sponsored industrialization It was Parks father authoritarian president Park Chung-hee who supported the creation of corporate giants such as Samsung and Hyundai encouraging links between government and business in the 1960s and 1970s that remain strong todayPark learned about the coalition of business and politics from her father said Kim Dong-choon a professor of social sciences at Sungkonghoe University Parks watch stopped in the 1970s he saidThis homogeneous nation also pits friendship and loyalty against following the lawThis is a very communitarian society and theres an expectation that youre going to go with the flow said Scott Snyder a Korea specialist at the Council on Foreign RelationsIn America friendships are run as contractual relationships and people know the boundaries operate within social rules of etiquette that generate a little more distance Snyder saidBut in South Korea creating this kind of distance is contrary to the bond of friendship The concept of butak  literally favor but with a deep sense of obligation and expectation attached  means that it is hard to say no when a friend asks you for something   This concept makes it difficult to create checks and balances that can overcome personal networks Snyder saidInstitutions end up being compromised by the fact that Mr Kim at the Blue House went to elementary school with Mr Lee at the prosecutors office he said Thats the classic struggle that makes corruption endemicThis scandal comes just after South Korea enacted a new law designed to root out bribery and corruption prohibiting people from spending more than $27 on a meal for public officials employees of state-run companies or journalistsBut that law was designed to target corruption at the lower end of the scale doing little to address the kinds of issues raised in Choi-gate as it is known hereAlmost two-thirds of people surveyed by the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission in 2014 said they thought South Korean society was corruptTackling this problem will not be easy said Lee Tae-ho of Peoples Solidarity for Participatory Democracy an activist organizationWe are calling for Parks resignation but because there are many structural problems we are calling for citizens to help solve this problem he said The solutions should come from the political sphere but the political sphere also has problemsLee noted that some left-wing parties had been bannedKim Dong-choon the social scientist said This is not just about Parks and Chois misdeeds but other forces  the prosecutorial system the bureaucratic system  and the shortcomings that have made this incident possibleThis is a great opportunity for Koreans to rebuild our society and our politics Kim said to overcome old ways of thinking Yoonjung Seo contributed to this reportHe was he insisted just an academic who had absolutely no contact with the Russian government Any suggestion that he had offered to play matchmaker between the future president of the United States and the power players of the Kremlin was he maintained dismissively incredibleOr so he told reportersBut in private exchanges Joseph Mifsud was proud of his alleged high-level Moscow contacts reporting that they had extended all the way to the top Hed had he told a former assistant late last year a private meeting with Russian President Vladimir PutinThe assistant didnt think much of that claim But the boastfulness matches the portrait of Mifsud sketched in court papers unsealed Monday that have made him one of the most critical  and enigmatic  figures in s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election   In those papers  a plea agreement for former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos  Mifsud is not named But the Maltese national and London-based academic confirmed Tuesday that he is the professor mentioned in the probeAccording to the court files the professor took an interest in Papadopoulos after the latter joined the Trump campaign Mifsud promised him dirt on Hillary Clinton compiled by the Russians including thousands of emails He also offered to serve as a go-between in Papadopouloss efforts to connect the Trump campaign with the Kremlin even going so far as introducing Papadopoulos to a woman he identified as Putins nieceWhether Mifsud really had the sort of Kremlin contacts that Papadopoulos claims he advertised is unknown But of how the Trump campaign regarded Mifsuds apparent approach and whether it yielded anything substantive could be a key focus of Muellers investigationMifsud who is in his mid-50s insisted Tuesday that the claims embedded in the court documents are exaggerated echoing points he had made months earlier in response to inquiries from The Washington PostI have a clear conscience Mifsud told Britains Daily TelegraphMifsud told the Telegraph that he knew nothing about emails containing dirt on Clinton calling the allegations upsetting He also dismissed the disclosure that he introduced Papadopoulos to a female Russian national calling the allegation a laughingstockIn emails to The Post in response to questions in August Mifsud had played down his connections to Moscow insisting they were purely related to his work as a professorI am an academic I do not even speak Russian he wroteBut the details that emerged Tuesday based on interviews with those who know him his writings and his travels suggested a more complex picture one that better matched the image of the professor in court files as a somewhat obscure European academic who longed for moreHailing from Malta the European Unions smallest nation he parlayed roles advising the government there into top positions with educational institutions that bear exalted-sounding names but are little-known even within academia Those included president of the Slovenia-based Euro-Mediterranean University and honorary director at the London Academy of DiplomacyNatalia Kutepova-Jamom his onetime assistant at the academy said he had set out in 2014 to build his contacts with Russian academics and policymakersShe said that she booked her former boss a speaking slot in 2014 at the Sochi meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club a Russian state-funded think tank that is seen as close to the Kremlin to speak on economic and international cooperationMifsud later suggested to her that he used those early contacts to open doors for higher-level meetings But she was in disbelief when he told her last year that his contacts had reached all the way to Putin with whom Mifsud claimed to have had a short private meetingShe said she didnt believe the two met because Mifsud is a too small-time person to meet with the Russian leaderBut Mifsud himself had written about being in the room with Putin to hear him speak at a 2015 event hosted by the Valdai Discussion Club and reported that he had asked a question of Foreign Minister Sergei LavrovIn that piece for Valdais website he wrote approvingly of Russias policy in Syria saying Putin had walked the talk The US administration of then-President Barack Obama by contrast was on the defensiveIn a spring 2016 piece  about the same time he was allegedly meeting with Papadopoulos  he asserted that he knew Russia quite wellOnline biographies present Mifsud as an authority in the field of international relations and diplomacy across Europe the United States Russia Africa and the Mediterranean region But his academic work in these areas appears limited He has published in peer-reviewed journals on Maltese education policiesAccording to a biography on the London Centre of International Law Practices website which was deleted Sunday Mifsud served prominently in Maltas Ministry of Foreign Affairs and worked as an adviser for Maltas Ministry of EducationScotlands University of Stirling said in an emailed statement that Mifsud joined its politics department in May this year as a full-time professorial teaching fellowFormer colleagues said they didnt think of Mifsud as someone with any particular Russian expertiseNabil Ayad who hired Mifsud as an honorary director at the London Academy of Diplomacy  where Ayad was founder and director  said Mifsuds focus was broadly in the area of diplomacyAs assistant to the Maltese foreign minister he traveled to many countries and met many heads of state Ayad saidAyad said the institutions work involved occasional trips to Moscow including for collaboration with the Diplomatic Academy of the Russian Foreign MinistryWe tend to deal with governments so I dont think he has any special connections or relationships Ayad said If a meeting took place between a Russian official or he introduced someone it must have been by chance not by designBut Mifsud had occasionally gone beyond the role of the typical academic In 2015 he was an observer for elections in Kazakhstan that were sharply criticized by independent groups Mifsuds take was far rosier mirroring the Russian lineThe election he told Kazakh media was consistent with all international normsAt many polling stations was an image that I associate with a family meeting he reported  Mifsud told that he introduced Papadopoulos to a program director of the Russian International Affairs Council a state-funded Russian think tank that is close to the Foreign Ministry and that he tried to set up meetings with experts on the European UnionWe are academics Mifsud told the paper We work closely with everybodyHe said that he met Papadopoulos in Italy in March 2016 and then 10 days later in LondonMifsuds contacts in Moscow go back to at least 2012 when a delegation from Moscow State Universitys Faculty of Global Processes established a partnership with the London Diplomatic Academy according to publications by the university faculty and a newsletter founded by order of the Russian Ministry of Foreign AffairsBetween 2013 and 2017 Mifsud visited Moscow State University about once each year giving lectures and posing for photographs with the department head Ilya IlyinThe nature of the partnership was not immediately clear although Mifsud had discussed exchange programs and joint research projects The department advertises itself as a stepping stone for graduates to work in the Russian government the presidential administration federal ministries and agencies the special services and outside of government Alexei Andreev the deputy director of the faculty said in a promotional videoReached on Tuesday by telephone Alexeev played down the departments ties to MifsudI think he is one of those people who has a lot of connections he said Krohn reported from Atlanta and Witte from Berlin Brian Murphy in Washington Andrew Roth and David Filipov in Moscow and Isaac Stanley-Becker in Oxford England contributed to this reportSEOUL  Kim Jong Uns regime defied international warnings and conducted a fourth nuclear test last month  one it claimed was of a hydrogen bomb  and then launched a long-range rocket this month widely viewed as part of its missile programThe international community has condemned the moves as and has declared that North Korea must pay for its actions Some countries  including South Korea Japan and the United States  have taken direct action while negotiations continue in the United Nations on a package of measures that could pass the Security Council where China and Russia are veto-wielding permanent members Many Western nations together with South Korea and Japan want tough sanctions but China is concerned about destabilizing its neighbor and has previously insisted on watering down any measures against North Korea  Heres a rundown on the sanctions that are in place against North Korea as of Feb 19President Obama has enacted the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 which passed the House and Senate with almost unanimous supportDaniel Wertz of the National Committee on North Korea has produced an excellent readable summary of the legislation Essentially the lawThe Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control

Korea over the last decade These includeThe full list can be viewedTOKYO  North Korea Friday Heres what we know so farYes it really was a nuclear test The US Geological Survey said the 53 magnitude seismic event it recorded had explosion-like characteristics and occurred where North Korea has detonated nuclear devices in the past The Norths first nuclear test was in 2006and three have been carried out since Kim Jong Un took power in late 2011The quake had all the hallmarks of an explosion the waveform is sudden unlike an earthquake and the depth is shallow Plus it happened at a known North Korean nuclear test siteHeres a good explanationHow do nuclear blasts differ from natural earthquakes Lawrence Livermore describes [PDF]   USGS (@USGS) Not necessarily North Korea announced that they had conducted a nuclear explosion test and that they had standardized a nuclear warhead Just because theyre right on the former doesnt mean theyre right on the latterMaking a nuclear warhead small and light enough to attach to a missile is a difficult thing Analysts and military chiefs think North Korea is well on the way to this capability but theres no sign they are there yetAnd even if they do manage to miniaturize a nuclear device and stick it on a missile theres still a whole lot more steps to go through A nuclear missile goes through extremes of heat and cold shakes with vibrations during launch and has to survive re-entry and hit its target Theres a lot of things that can go wrong thereBut North Korea is  And its latest nuclear test does constitute another step down the path to what some people think is Pyongyangs ultimate aim being able to send a nuclear-tipped missile to the US mainlandSorry about that But its true that this is a pretty scary situation Kim Jong Un has made it clear that hes determined to make North Korea a nuclear state  and hes certainly shown no inclination to return to diplomatic negotiations aimed at persuading him to give up his weapons programs The example always cited in North Korea analyst circles is Libya Moammar Gaddafi gave up his nukes and look what happened to himBut heres a nice graphic from the AFP news agency putting North Koreas nuclear blasts in historical perspective How do North Koreas nuclear tests measure up  AFP news agency (@AFP) Well China is one country that has real leverage over North Korea given that it provides economic aid to its neighbor and is its main route for trading with the rest of the world China is always concerned about stability on its borders and has shown itself to prioritize keeping North Korea afloat over punishing Kim and his croniesThat said China seems pretty angry right now North Korea fired three missiles on Monday while Chinese president Xi Jinping was hosting the Group of 20 summit in Hangzhou  and those missiles were technically capable of hitting Hangzhou Not a subtle messageOn Friday Chinas foreign ministry released a statement condemning the test and saying it would work with the international community to urge North Korea to return to talks and give up its nukesThe question now is whether China gets serious about enforcing sanctionsFriday marks the Day of the Foundation of the Republic  a public holiday commemorating the 68 anniversary of the formation of the North Korean government by Kim Il Sung North Koreas founding president and the current leaders grandfather So its an important day for the regimeBut the test could also have been timed to push back at speculation that the regime is showing cracks after a handful of high-level defections including the and a couple of officials involved in making money for the Kim familyIt could also be a signal to the outside world that North Korea wont be cowed The United States will send an anti-missile battery to South Korea and China has been supporting UN statements deploring North Koreas recent actions This is Kim Jong Uns way of saying youre not the boss of meJapanese sniffer planes went up Friday and there are probably some American ones flying around too Theyll be trying to measure radiation levels and capture gases so nuclear scientists can draw some conclusions about the test Lets see if any gases escape the test tunnel that would give away the nature of the device says Joshua Pollack editor of the Nonproliferation ReviewThen it will be back to the UN Security Council We can expect meetings and harshly worded statements out of the United Nations and a push for more sanctions But the question is What else can the international community do There have been lots of new sanctions imposed this year  a crackdown on mineral exports increased cargo inspections tougher financial limitations  and clearly none of them have made Kim Jong Un stop with the missiles and the nuclear testsThere arent many other options A military strike is out  no one has any appetite for another war and striking North Korea would probably unleash a volley of artillery by the North across the Demilitarized Zone at Seoul home to 20 million peopleTheres another option flooding North Korea with trade and investment and information and trying that way to convince them to change But with all this defiance theres even less appetite for engagement than there is for military actionIts a classic North Korean announcement This is Ri Chun Hee a veteran newsreader who was brought out of retirement in January to announce the fourth nuclear test When she shows up you know its bigWealthy Americans appear to have found a way to get around one of the taxes they are supposed to be paying under Obamacare according tofederal dataThe nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxationa congressional agency published Tuesday projecting a surcharge on profitfrom rich taxpayers investments would produce less revenue thantheyd previously predicted Indeed thecommittee shaved about a quarter off its revenue projection from the one it submitted last year cutting the estimate bymore than $60 billionThe committee as is typical for its guidelines did not provide an explanation for the projection in reduced revenue but tax experts said they think it might bebecausethe wealthy aregetting around the lawThis tax on investments has been eroded over time as taxpayers have kind of figured out ways to put income into untaxed forms said Mark Mazur the director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center Taxpayers planning techniques change over time so you would see it in the estimates with a lagIn the last several years Treasury has reported that weve seen some significant tax avoidance said David Kamin a former economic adviser in Obamas White House This may be one reason why JCT has reduced its estimateThe tax in question is a 38 percent fee on gains from certain investments but it only applies to individual taxpayers with more than $200000 in annual incomeor to married couples making more than $250000There are a few ways that wealthy taxpayers can avoid the tax One approach is for taxpayers to place investments in a legal entity known as an S corporation and then to pay themselvesa salary out of the corporations funds The S corporations profits are not technically salaries or wages so they are not subject to payroll taxes At the same time because a taxpayer is an employee of their own corporation the profits do not qualify as the kind of indirect passive income that would be taxedIn  calling for changes analysts in former president Barack Obamas Treasury Department said that taxpayers who use this technique pay the tax on just 42 percent of the income from their S corporationsThere is an alternativepossible explanation for the drop in projected revenueMazur saidThe committee may be using a morepessimistic estimate of how much profitwealthy taxpayers will see from theirinvestments and therefore how much tax theyll pay on themWhatever the causethe committee projected that repealing the tax would eliminate $223 billion in revenue over the coming decade The committees new prediction is that a similar repeal would cost just $158 billion indicating that the staff expects substantially less money from the tax than theydid last yearPart of the discrepancy is thatlast year the committee estimated the effect of repealing the tax immediately while this year the committee considered a proposal to delay the repeal forone year The government would be able to collect some additional revenue during that extra yearThe change in thecommittees estimatehas political implications for Republicans as theywork to repeal Obamacare (officially known as theAffordable Care Act)  including the laws tax oninvestment incomeRepublicans are usinga special procedural maneuver known as reconciliation toadvance their proposals through Congress The maneuver allows them to avoid a filibusterfrom Democrats in the Senate but it also requiresRepublicans to present a bill thatwould not result in more forecast borrowing by the federal governmentUnder the old estimate Republicans would have to find new spending cuts new revenue or some combination of the two to make up for the full $223 billion in projected lost revenue The new formula cuts the task down to making up only $158 billion in lost revenueThe Congressional Budget Office is expected to publish its official analysis incorporating the revisionin the coming daysRepublicans generally argue against increasing taxes on the wealthy to pay for social services such as the financial help offered to ordinary families buying health insurance under ObamasAffordable Care Act For Republicans these taxes penalize the rich for working investing and contributing to the economyBut Kamin Obamas former adviser argued that Republicans arepushing a giveaway to wealthy taxpayersThese are major tax cuts providing very significant tax relief to people at the top Kamin said of GOP plans to scrap the tax Instead he said the GOP should take the opportunity to simply close these loopholes so that this tax would raise the revenue that it was supposed to in the first placeThe unconventional administration of President Trump may be causing consternation among American liberals But here in Germany the anchor of the European Union Trumps rise is helping fuel an unexpected surge of the leftWhat is happening in Germany is the kind of Trump bump perhaps never foreseen by his supporters  a boost not for the German nationalists viewed as Trumps natural allies but for his fiercest critics in the center left The Social Democrats (SPD) have bounced back under the charismatic Martin Schulz the former head of the European Parliament who took over as party chairman last month and is now staging a surprisingly strong bid to unseat Chancellor Angela MerkelIn a country that stands as a painful example of the disastrous effects of radical nationalism Schulz is building a campaign in part around bold attacks on Trump He has stopped well short of direct comparisons to Adolf Hitler but Schulz recently mentioned Trump in the same speech in which he heralded his partys resistance to the Nazis in the lead-up to World War II  We will never give up our values our freedom and democracy no matter what challenges we are facing Schulz said in a recent speech He added That a US president wants to put up walls is thinking aloud about torture and attacks women religious communities minorities people with handicaps artists and intellectuals with brazen and dangerous comments is a breach of taboo thats unbearableHis anti-Trump platform comes as Germans are questioning American power more than at any point since the end of the Cold War illustrating an erosion of allied faith in the new era of America first A recent poll found that only 22percent of Germans see the United States led by Trump as a reliable partner  putting it only one percentage point above RussiaThe in France and Britain But buoyed by Schulzs approach his party last week pulled ahead of Merkels center-right Christian Democrats in opinion polls for the first time in six years Elections are not until September but analysts are giving the SPD under Schulz its best chances to regain power since Gerhard Schrder lost to Merkel in 2005There are different factors that are coming together for the SPD said Ralf Stegner the partys deputy chairman Schulz has provided a new impulse for people who were waiting to come back  but also the new American president because Trumps presidency has politicized the German public making them more active and awareWithout naming names Merkel has taken aim at Trump  criticizing for instance his refugee ban But Schulz has also accused Merkel of being too diplomatic  Germany which shoulders the history of Nazi tyranny is an outlier in containing the current spread of me-first nationalism Even as far-right parties and isolationist politics gain ground elsewhere in Europe the largest right-wing populist party here  the Alternative for Germany  has fallen slightly in the polls since Trumps electionAt the same time left-wing parties in Germany have seen a jump in dues-paying members There are also signs that Trumps election is making left-leaning voters in Germany more politically activeTake for instance Kristina Seidler a 28-year-old mother and Dsseldorf resident who works as a substantiality adviser for a textile company She has voted for the SPD before But the day after Trumps victory she signed up as a dues-paying member and party volunteerHorrified by Trumps win she said she sees the traditional left as the only answer and is preparing to put up posters and help with campaigning as the German election season rolls into high gearWhat kind of sign is it for the world when a man who is a racist who treats women so badly can become the president of the United States Seidler said I thought Its time for me to do somethingPerhaps the biggest single driver of the SPDs new popularity however is SchulzThe SPD is already part of Merkels governing grand coalition with the partys senior operatives filling top cabinet posts Yet its popularity with its left-leaning base has been hampered by that power-sharing deal Under its former chairman Sigmar Gabriel  Merkels foreign minister  the SPD was struggling to distance itself from the current governmentEnter Schulz who last month took over as the partys chairman and candidate positioning himself as an outsider who could mix things up in Berlin A 61-year-old who never finished high school Schulz has embraced his imperfections openly speaking about his battle with alcoholism He started in local politics becoming the mayor of the western German town of Wrselen before being elected to the European Parliament in 1994He rose through the ranks as a champion of European unity civil rights and social justice becoming the parliaments president in 2012 He has at times been chided for his tell-it-like-it-is approach drawing the wrath of the Hungarian and Polish governments after decrying democratic lapses in those countriesCritics call Schulz similar to Trump in at least one regard He is a straight talker who argues against elites and favors the common man He is also blunt  a trait that contrasts with Merkel a leader famous for her meandering parsed answersThe way in which he conjures up the alleged division of society in a populist manner is along the lines of the post-factual methods of the US election campaign Merkels finance minister Wolfgang Schuble charged in Der Spiegel last weekIn the dealmaking game that is coalition governments Schulz may have several paths to the chancellery if his party can maintain its momentum It will be difficult analysts say but Schulzs rising popularity means it is no longer unthinkable that Merkel loses  Merkels open-door policy for refugees brought a barrage of criticism from the conservative wing of her party And despite Merkels hesitance Horst Seehofer head of her sister party the Christian Social Union appears to be extending his hand to Trump praising the new presidents consistency and speed in implementing his campaign promisesA Merkel loss could mean a greater frost in German-U S relations harking back to the days of Schrders cool relationship with President George W Bush Merkel while has nevertheless avoided outright conflict Analysts call that further evidence of her pragmatism and firm belief that Germany needs the United States diplomatically and for collective defenseGoing after Trump might be a smart strategy for winning elections but not for running a government said Jrgen Falter a political scientist at Mainz University Stephanie Kirchner contributed to this reportRoy Moore arrived in the Capitol to play an unfamiliar role Republican conformist By the time he left he was once again a lightning rod for controversy The hard-right former judge made his second trip to Washington on Tuesday as his partys Senate nominee in Alabama Unlike  Moore decided to mingle with the Republican establishment he has villainized on the campaign trail He joined Republican senators at their weekly policy luncheon Most backed his opponent in the primary He chatted with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) his bitter foeAfterward he refrained from reiterating his criticism of the Kentuckian Moore also dodged questions from reporters about incendiary statements he has made about a Muslim serving in Congress and gay people declaring that he was not there to answer any questions about issuesAs he made the rounds some of Moores potential future Republican colleagues strained to separate themselves from him One even attacked him head-on in a speech on the Senate floorThe visit offered a preview of the headaches Moores presence could cause for Senate Republican leaders should he prevail in a Dec 12 special election to fill the seat once held by Attorney General Jeff SessionsI dont know where Im going right now Moore told reporters as he exited Tuesdays lunch and walked down a hallway near the Senate chamber before doubling back toward a bank of elevators Asked by one reporter whether he still thinks Rep Keith Ellison (D-Minn) should not be a member of Congress because hes Muslim as Moore wrote in a 2006 opinion piece Moore replied Ill address that laterDid he still think homosexual conduct should be illegal Im not answering any questions on issues right now Moore saidHe said he spoke at lunch to McConnell whom he has vowed to oppose as leader But as he departed the second floor of the Capitol he said he was not going to give an opinion on that matter at that momentLess than two hours later Sen Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) a frequent critic of the far-right and President Trump who is retiring at the end of this Congress used a floor speech in favor of a conservative judicial nominee to condemn MooreWhen the presidential nominee of my party the party of Lincoln called for a Muslim ban it was wrong and I said so said Flake When a judge expressed his personal belief that a Muslim should not be a member of Congress because of his faith it was wrong That this same judge is now my partys nominee for the Senate should concern us all Religious tests have no place in the United States CongressMoores visit came amid an effort by Senate Republicans to criticize Democrats for what they have charged was anti-Catholic animus against judicial nominee Amy Coney Barrett a Catholic law professor who has questioned the legal rationale behind the Supreme Court ruling on abortion in  The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Barrett to serve on the US Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit Republicans have focused on Sen Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif) who accused Barrett at a hearing of letting dogma overwhelm legal reasoning and then expanded to attacking any Democrat who opposed BarrettBut some of the same lawmakers lodging that complaint have not forcefully criticized Moores past comment about Ellison adding awkwardness to their line of attack on the basis of religious libertyFor some Republican senators Moores appearance on Tuesday also created some discomfortAsked whether he supported Moore Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune (SD) responded Im hoping to meet with him while hes up here I havent had a chance to do that yet I dont know himLike Trump and many other leading Republicans Thune backed Sen Luther Strange in the GOP primary that Moore wonHe stood up and was pleasant in his comments said Sen Bob Corker (R-Tenn) recalling Moores appearance at lunch But Corker wasnt won over  and he did not want to weigh in on Moores controversial positionsI plan on staying out of the election and the people of Alabama will determine that he said And I have nothing to do whatsoever with whats happening in the Senate race in AlabamaMoore is scheduled to attend a fundraiser in Washington on Wednesday evening An invitation distributed by his campaign this month lists the names of prominent conservative activists and senators backing his campaign including Sen Mike Lee (R-Utah) But in a sign that Moore may not even be on the same page as some of his allies in Washington a spokesman for Lee said Tuesday that it was not on the senators to-do listTomorrows fundraiser is not on our schedule said the spokesman Conn CarrollThe first criminal charges stemming from the Russia investigation landed this week at a perilous point in Donald Trumps presidency threatening his standing with foreign leaders ahead of an important trip to Asia on Friday and his effectiveness in selling the Republican tax plan set to be released this weekAides insisted the twin challenges at home and abroad would not be undermined by the indictments but   whose job approval ratings hit a new low this week in   was evident Tuesday  in which he lashed out at the media and Crooked Dems and urged a focus instead on the Massive Tax Cuts he has promised to deliver by ChristmasIn a bid to show he remains focused on the tasks at hand Trump later in the day allowed reporters to witness the start of a  at which he boasted that the December signing of the yet-to-be-unveiled GOP tax bill would be the biggest tax event in the history of our countryBut special counsel Robert S Mueller IIIs probe loomed large At the meeting Trump ignored reporters shouted questions related to the charges unveiled Monday against three campaign officials including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos whom Trump derided on Twitter as a young low level volunteer and a liar  Foreign policy analysts said Trumps political crisis could distract from or complicate his message on a high-stakes 12-day trip to five Asian nations aimed at building regional support for his bid to pressure North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programsBeyond Trumps tweeting analysts said the issue could dominate the US press corps coverage of the trip with reporters asking him about the Mueller investigation on foreign soilMichael Green an Asia policy aide to President George W Bush recalled the 43rd president being asked about the Iraq War during trips to Asia even as he attempted to sketch a vision of US engagement in the regionMy prediction is that it will be a story for the White House press corps and then the Asian press will pick up on it like an echo chamber said Green who was in Japan when news of Muellers indictments broke Monday He added that having been on those trips it can be very very hard for the White House to get their strategic and foreign policy message throughTrump plans to visit Japan South Korea China Vietnam and the Philippines engaging in bilateral meetings with a host of foreign leaders Aides have been briefing him heavilyThe trip comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping has consolidated power on the heels of the Communist Partys National Congress creating another problematic narrative for TrumpTrump is by far the weakest leader in modern US history and Xi is by far the strongest leader said Ian Bremmer president of the Eurasia Group a global risk assessment firm Thats going to make the meeting uncomfortableBremmer who also was in Japan last week at a security conference said Japanese officials are concerned that Trump could be motivated to take a more provocative stance on North Korea or on US trade relations with South Korea and China to distract from his domestic problemsUnlike past US leaders who have tried to stay on message in Asia while dealing with distractions at home Trump always wants to create a distraction Bremmer said To what extent will he play harder ball with the Chinese or North Koreans or on trade And most importantly will he decide to really fulminate against the North Koreans It is dangerous the combination of all thatBonnie Glaser a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies was in Beijing last weekThe Chinese are worried that his domestic problems will cause Trump to do something internationally that will bolster his domestic position and distract people from his problems at home she saidThe biggest worry is an attack on North Korea Glaser said Those who think he is not bluffing  they think this is something they should be worried aboutIn interviews several prominent Republicans argued that the tax bill will rise or fall based on factors unrelated to Trumps level of distractionHeading into next years midterm elections Republicans in Congress are under tremendous pressure to show they can get something done with control of both chambers and the White HouseThis bill was never going to pass because Donald Trump went up to the Hill and negotiated it said Barry Bennett a GOP consultant who advised Trump during last years general election Its going to pass because Republicans have to pass it  Theyre not really counting on much leadership from the presidentA senior Republican congressional aide largely echoed that sentiment and said lawmakers do not expect Trump to have much of an impact in the days following the bills introduction this week and its subsequent markup by the House Ways and Means Committee in a stretch when hell be out of the countryIts kind of an inside-the-cone process said the aide who requested anonymity to speak more candidly Im not sure how much Trump would make a differenceBut the aide said there will be points later in the process that could benefit from presidential leadership including help selling the legislation to the public before the full House votes and navigating differences that emerge after the Senate passes a billThe aide also said lawmakers have become accustomed to having to navigate distractions created by the White HouseWhen this year have we not had some big story about Russia or something else supposedly looming over us the aide said This is kind of the new normalOther observers suggested the pervasiveness of the Russia probe  which continued to dominate cable television news much of Tuesday  will have a more significant impact on Capitol Hill particularly if more indictments are handed down in coming weeksIt brings more chaos into an already chaotic situation where theyre operating on an almost impossible timeline to begin with said Jim Manley a lobbyist and longtime aide to then-Senate Minority Leader Harry M Reid (D-Nev)Manley and others also argued that Trump tends to lash out on Twitter when hes agitated  and often not in a helpful wayLast week for instance he tweeted that the tax-cut plan would not include any changes to tax-deferred retirement accounts such as 401(k)s following reports last week that House Republicans were weighing a sharp reduction in the amount of income American workers could save through such programsWhile they say they would welcome Democratic support leaders of both chambers are preparing to pass the bill with only Republican votes In the Senate where there are 52 Republicans that means the party can lose only two GOP votesThey dont have margin for error so it doesnt take much to get off track said John Weaver who was chief strategist for the 2016 presidential campaign of Ohio Gov John Kasich (R)Doug Heye a GOP political consultant said the Mueller indictments have largely overshadowed what could have been a string of positive stories about Trumps week  his push for tax cuts the expected announcement of a new Federal Reserve chairman on Thursday and a major trip abroadThis distraction makes it harder to see any successes they have Heye said It highlights a problem this administration had since the beginning  staying out of its own wayRussian government hackers penetrated the computer network of the Democratic National Committee and gained access to the entire database of opposition research on GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump according to committee officials and security experts who responded to the breachThe intruders so thoroughly compromised the DNCs system that they also were able to read all email and chat traffic said DNC officials and the security expertsThe intrusion into the DNC was one of several The networks of presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were also targeted by Russian spies as were the computers of some Republican political action committees US officials said But details on those cases were not available  I completely rule out a possibility that the [Russian] government or the government bodies have been involved in this Dmitry Peskov the Kremlins spokesman told the Reuters news agency in Moscow Some of the hackers had access to the DNC network for about a year but all were expelled over the past weekend in a major computer cleanup campaign the committee officials and experts saidThe DNC said that no financial donor or personal information appears to have been accessed or taken suggesting that the breach was traditional espionage not the work of criminal hackersThe intrusions are an example of Russias interest in the US political system and its desire to understand the policies strengths and weaknesses of a potential future president  much as American spies gather similar information on foreign candidates and leadersThe depth of the penetration reflects the skill and determination of the United States top cyber-adversary as Russia goes after strategic targets from the White House and State Department to political campaign organizations  Its the job of every foreign intelligence service to collect intelligence against their adversaries said Shawn Henry president of CrowdStrike the cyber firm called in to handle the DNC breach and a former head of the FBIs cyber division He noted that it is extremely difficult for a civilian organization to protect itself from a skilled and determined state such as RussiaWere perceived as an adversary of Russia he said Their job when they wake up every day is to gather intelligence against the policies practices and strategies of the US government There are a variety of ways [Hacking] is one of the more valuable because it gives you a treasure trove of informationRussian President Vladimir Putin  who has called for better relations with Russia and expressed skepticism about NATO But unlike Clinton whom the Russians probably have long had in their spy sights Trump has not been a politician for very long so foreign agencies are playing catch-up analysts sayThe purpose of such intelligence gathering is to understand the targets proclivities said Robert Deitz former senior councillor to the CIA director and a former general counsel at the National Security Agency Trumps foreign investments for example would be relevant to understanding how he would deal with countries where he has those investments should he be elected Deitz said They may provide tips for understanding his style of negotiating In short this sort of intelligence could be used by Russia for example to indicate where it can get away with foreign adventurism  Other analysts noted that any dirt dug up in opposition research is likely to be made public anyway Nonetheless DNC leadership acted quickly after the intrusions discovery to contain the damageThe security of our system is critical to our operation and to the confidence of the campaigns and state parties we work with said Rep Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla) the DNC chairwoman When we discovered the intrusion we treated this like the serious incident it is and reached out to CrowdStrike immediately Our team moved as quickly as possible to kick out the intruders and secure our network  Clinton called the intrusion troubling in an interview with Telemundo She also said So far as we know my campaign has not been hacked into and added that cybersecurity is an issue that she will be absolutely focused on if she becomes president Because whether its Russia or China Iran or North Korea more and more countries are using hacking to steal our information to use it to their advantage she said A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign referred questions to the Secret ServiceDNC leaders were tipped to the hack in late April Chief executive Amy Dacey got a call from her operations chief saying that their information technology team had noticed some unusual network activityIts never a call any executive wants to get but the IT team knew something was awry Dacey said And they knew it was serious enough that they wanted experts to investigateThat evening she spoke with Michael Sussmann a DNC lawyer who is a partner with Perkins Coie in Washington Soon after Sussmann a former federal prosecutor who handled computer crime cases called Henry whom he has known for many yearsWithin 24 hours CrowdStrike had installed software on the DNCs computers so that it could analyze data that could indicate who had gained access when and howThe firm identified two separate hacker groups both working for the Russian government that had infiltrated the network said Dmitri Alperovitch CrowdStrike co-founder and chief technology officer The firm had analyzed other breaches by both groups over the past two years  One group which CrowdStrike had dubbed Cozy Bear had gained access last summer and was monitoring the DNCs email and chat communications Alperovitch saidThe other which the firm had named Fancy Bear broke into the network in late April and targeted the opposition research files It was this breach that set off the alarm The hackers stole two files Henry said And they had access to the computers of the entire research staff  an average of about several dozen on any given dayThe computers contained research going back years on Trump Its a huge job to dig into the dealings of somebody who has never run for office before Dacey saidCrowdStrike is not sure how the hackers got in The firm suspects they may have targeted DNC employees with spearphishing emails These are communications that appear legitimate  often made to look like they came from a colleague or someone trusted  but that contain links or attachments that when clicked on deploy malicious software that enables a hacker to gain access to a computer But we dont have hard evidence Alperovitch saidThe two groups did not appear to be working together Alperovitch said Fancy Bear is believed to work for the GRU or Russias military intelligence service he said CrowdStrike is less sure of whom Cozy Bear works for but thinks it might be the Federal Security Service or FSB the countrys powerful security agency which was once headed by Putin  The lack of coordination is not unusual he said Theres an amazing adversarial relationship among the Russian intelligence agencies Alperovitch said We have seen them steal assets from one another refuse to collaborate Theyre all vying for power to sell Putin on how good they areThe two crews have superb operational tradecraft he said They often use previously unknown software bugs  known as zero-day vulnerabilities  to compromise applications In the DNCs case the hackers constantly switched tactics to maintain a stealthy presence inside the network and used built-in Windows tools so that they didnt have to resort to malicious code that might trigger alerts They flew under the radar Alperovitch saidThe two groups have hacked government agencies tech companies defense contractors energy and manufacturing firms and universities in the United States Canada and Europe as well as in Asia he saidCozy Bear for instance compromised the unclassified email systems of the White House State Department and Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2014 Alperovitch saidThis is a sophisticated foreign intelligence service with a lot of time a lot of resources and is interested in targeting the US political system Henry said He said the DNC was not engaged in a fair fight Youve got ordinary citizens who are doing hand-to-hand combat with trained military officers he said And thats an untenable situationRussia has always been a formidable foe in cyberspace but in the past two years theres been a thousand-fold increase in its espionage campaign against the West said Alperovitch who is also a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council They feel under siegeWestern sanctions imposed after Russias annexation of Crimea in Ukraine have hurt the economy and led the government to increase its theft of intellectual property to limit the impact of import restrictions he said And Russias growing isolation has increased the need for intelligence to understand and influence political decisions in other countries he addedCrowdStrike is continuing the forensic investigation said Sussmann the DNC lawyer But at this time it appears that no financial information or sensitive employee donor or voter information was accessed by the Russian attackers he saidThe firm has installed special software on every computer and server in the network to detect any efforts by the Russian cyberspies to break in again When they get kicked out of the system Henry predicted theyre going to try to come back in Tom Hamburger contributed to this reportFormer Trump campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis is facing renewed opposition to his nomination to serve as the Agriculture Departments chief scientist amid revelations that he encouraged a campaign adviser to foster ties with Russian officialsOn Tuesday several thousand scientists and researchers affiliated with two national organizations that have rallied against Cloviss nomination signed letters urging the Senate Committee on Agriculture Nutrition and Forestry not to confirm him calling him unfit for the post The former conservative radio talk-show host from Iowa was already a controversial choice to be the departments chief scientist Clovis who is not a trained scientist is a climate change skeptic who protecting gay rights could lead to the legalization of pedophilia In every aspect Clovis falls far short of the standards demanded by the position the Union of Concerned Scientists wrote in a one-page to the committees chairman Sen Pat Roberts (R-Kan) and the panels top Democrat Sen Debbie Stabenow (Mich) The letter had 3100 signers   Mike Lavender senior Washington representative for the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists said in a statement that emerging evidence of Clovis potential involvement with the Trump campaigns Russian connections should be the final nail in the coffin for his confirmationThe Center for Science in the Public Interest sent the committee a similar letter Tuesday A lawyer for Clovis who is currently a senior White House adviser to the Agriculture Department did not respond to a request for commentThe new round of opposition came after Clovis was identified as  by foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to broker a relationship with Russian officials Court documents unsealed Monday revealed that Papadopoulos in early October to making false statement to FBI investigators about his contacts with foreigners claiming to have high-level Russian connectionsIn August 2016 Clovis encouraged Papadopoulos to organize an off the record meeting with Russian officials according to court documents I would encourage you and another foreign policy adviser to the campaign to make the trip if it is feasible Clovis wrote The meeting did not ultimately take place Cloviss attorney Victoria Toensing told The Washington Post on Monday that her client always vigorously opposed any Russian trip for Donald Trump and/or the campaign She said his responses to Papadopoulos were a courtesy by a polite gentleman from Iowa  Clovis is likely to face questions about his interactions with Papadopoulos during his Senate hearing which had been tentatively scheduled for Nov9The emerging information about his role in the Trump campaigns interactions with Russia raises serious concerns Stabenow said in a statement As we consider his nomination I will be looking into these facts along with his questionable qualifications and long history of divisive and outrageous statementsRoberts spokeswoman Meghan Cline declined to comment on the opposition to Clovis saying that we are working on scheduling details and will announce a date for a nominations hearing soonA former economics professor at Morningside College in Iowa Clovis made an unsuccessful run for the US Senate in 2014 He served as one of Trumps first campaign policy advisers In a 2014 interview with Iowa Public Radio he said he was extremely skeptical about climate change  Clovis took a leave of absence from his position at Morningside College in 2015 to join the

reportSeveral GOP senators said Tuesday they will not support any efforts to cut the funding or otherwise curtail special counsel Robert S Mueller IIIs investigation into Russia meddling in the 2016 electionMy basic philosophy is once you have an independent counsel you ought to give him a chance to follow the facts said Sen Richard C Shelby (R-Ala) a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the chairman of the subcommittee that handles the Justice Departments funding If somebodys doing a job you dont want to cut it offI would not support that He needs to continue to investigate said Sen Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) who last week excoriated Trumps governing style in a speech announcing plans to retire at the end of next yearI would oppose said Sen John McCain (R-Ariz) one of the presidents most vocal critics in Congress And so would the American peopleThose voices and others reflect an emerging Republican message for dealing with the Mueller investigation Stay away from it  and warn Trump to do the same There would be an uprising at the Capitol like never seen before if any kind of interference looked like it was taking place said Sen Bob Corker (R-Tenn) Regardless of which side of the aisle Thats just beyond the paleThose reactions came amid evidence that some Republican lawmakers would like to curtail or at least redirect the ongoing investigations into Russian interference  including several congressional inquiries   Some Republican senators and House members for instance have heeded the presidents call in recent weeks to  launching new inquiries into a uranium deal with Russia that President Barack Obamas administration approved in 2010 Trump used the uranium deal as a political cudgel against Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail despite scant evidence she had personally played a role in the decision At least three congressional committees in the House and Senate are also continuing to look into how the Federal Bureau of Investigation handled Clintons email scandalBut even those Republicans calling for more attention to those new probes dont want to touch Muellers fundsI dont want to deny the Justice Department or special counsel resources they need said Senate Judiciary Committee member John Kennedy (R-La) just moments after telling reporters he believed the uranium probes deserved more attention Now I dont want to see them just go hog wild and waste money either But I dont want to try to do anything to hurt their effortCorker said there was no talk about the Mueller investigation at Tuesdays weekly GOP policy luncheon Most Republican lawmakers said they dont believe that Trump will fire Mueller or defund or otherwise upend his investigationThe idea that Bob Mueller is going to have the scope of his inquiry constrained or be otherwise restricted is really out there said Sen Susan Collins (R-Maine) I think thats extremely unlikelySo long as there are no signs that will change Republican leaders will continue trying to keep their focus on the legislative agenda which at the moment is all about tax reform In the Senate GOP leaders are also aiming to confirm a slate of judicial nominees  a top priority for many conservative activists The special counsel has his job to do The job we have here in the Senate is the investigation being carried out by the intelligence committee said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) in his first public comments since the first charges from Muellers inquiry were recently revealed One Republican in frequent contact with GOP lawmakers said Tuesday that there was an emerging consensus among them that the only way to head off a bloodbath in next years midterm elections is to pass a tax bill So they are trying to keep all their energy on that goal and shut out most everything else I think all these guys are running for their political lives said the Republican who was granted anonymity to speak candidly Still some are raising alarm bells about Muellers findings I guarantee you more shoes will drop said McCain He added later I guarantee you the scandals not over Paul Kane contributed to this reportRussias ambassador to Washington told his superiors in Moscow that he discussed campaign-related matters including policy issues important to Moscow with Jeff Sessions during the 2016 presidential race contrary to public assertions by the embattled attorney general according to current and former US officialsAmbassador Sergey Kislyaks accounts of two conversations with Sessions  then a top foreign policy adviser to Republican candidate Donald Trump  were intercepted by US spy agencies which monitor the communications of senior Russian officials in the United States and in Russia Sessions initially failed to disclose his contacts with Kislyak and then said that the meetings were not about the Trump campaignOne US official said that Sessions  who testified that he had no recollection of an April encounter  has provided misleading statements that are contradicted by other evidence A former official said that the intelligence indicates that Sessions and Kislyak had substantive discussions on matters including Trumps positions on Russia-related issues and prospects for US-Russia relations in a Trump administrationSessions has said repeatedly that he never discussed campaign-related issues with Russian officials and that it was only in his capacity as a US senator that he met with KislyakI never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign  when he announced that he would recuse himself from matters relating to the FBI probe of Russian interference in the election and any connections to the Trump campaign  Current and former US officials said that that assertion is at odds with Kislyaks accounts of conversations in two encounters during the campaign one in April ahead of Trumps first major foreign policy speech and another in July on the sidelines of the Republican National ConventionThe apparent discrepancy could pose new problems for Sessions as his position in the administration appears increasingly tenuousTrump expressed frustration with Sessionss recusing himself from the Russia probe and indicated regret at making the lawmaker from Alabama the nations top law enforcement officer Trump also faulted Sessions as giving bad answers during his confirmation hearing about his Russia contacts during the campaignOfficials emphasized that the information contradicting Sessions comes from US intelligence on Kislyaks communications with the Kremlin and they acknowledged that the Russian ambassador could have mischaracterized or exaggerated the nature of his interactionsObviously I cannot comment on the reliability of what anonymous sources describe in a wholly uncorroborated intelligence intercept that the Washington Post has not seen and that has not been provided to me said a Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores in a statement She reasserted that Sessions did not discuss interference in the electionRussian and other foreign diplomats in Washington and elsewhere have been known at times to report false or misleading information to bolster their standing with their superiors or to confuse US intelligence agenciesBut US officials with regular access to Russian intelligence reports say Kislyak  whose tenure as ambassador to the United States ended recently  was known for accurately relaying details about his interactions with officials in WashingtonSessions removed himself from direct involvement in the Russia investigation after it was revealed in The Washington Post that he had met with Kislyak at least twice in 2016 contacts he failed to disclose during his confirmation hearing in JanuaryI did not have communications with the Russians Sessions said when asked whether anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign had communicated with representatives of the Russian governmentHe has since maintained that he misunderstood the scope of the question and that his meetings with Kislyak were strictly in his capacity as a US senator In a March appearance on Fox television Sessions said I dont recall any discussion of the campaign in any significant waySessions appeared to narrow that assertion further  saying that he never met with or had any conversation with any Russians or foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United StatesBut when pressed for details during that hearing Sessions qualified many of his answers by saying that he could not recall or did not have any recollectionA former US official who read the Kislyak reports said that the Russian ambassador reported speaking with Sessions about issues that were central to the campaign including Trumps positions on key policy matters of significance to MoscowSessions had a third meeting with Kislyak in his Senate office in September Officials declined to say whether US intelligence agencies intercepted any Russian communications describing the third encounterAs a result the discrepancies center on two earlier Sessions-Kislyak conversations including one that Sessions has acknowledged took place in July 2016 on the sidelines of the Republican National ConventionBy that point Russian President Vladimir Putin had decided to embark on a secret campaign to help Trump win the White House by leaking damaging emails about Trumps rival Democrat Hillary Clinton according to US intelligence agenciesAlthough it remains unclear how involved Kislyak was in the covert Russian campaign to aid Trump his superiors in Moscow were eager for updates about the candidates positions particularly regarding US sanctions on Russia and long-standing disputes with the Obama administration over conflicts in Ukraine and SyriaKislyak also reported having a conversation with Sessions in April 2016 at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington where then-candidate Trump delivered his first major foreign policy address according to the officials familiar with intelligence on KislyakSessions has said he does not remember any encounter with Kislyak at that event In his June testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee Sessions said I do not recall any conversations with any Russian official at the Mayflower HotelLater in that hearing Sessions said that its conceivable that that occurred I just dont remember itKislyak also was a key figure in  who was forced to leave that job after The Post revealed that he had discussed US sanctions against Russia with Kislyak even while telling others in the Trump administration that he had not done soIn that case however Flynns phone conversations with Kislyak were intercepted by US intelligence providing irrefutable evidence The intelligence on Sessions by contrast is based on Kislyaks accounts and not corroborated by other sourcesFormer FBI director James B Comey fueled speculation about the possibility of a Sessions-Kislyak meeting at the Mayflower when he told the same Senate committee on June8 that the FBI had information about Sessions that would have made it problematic for him to be involved in overseeing the Russia probeComey would not provide details of what information the FBI had except to say that he could discuss it only privately with the senators Current and former officials said he appeared to be alluding to intelligence on Kislyaks account of an encounter with Sessions at the MayflowerSenate Democrats later called on the FBI to investigate the event in April at the Mayflower hotelSessionss role in removing Comey as FBI director angered many at the bureau and set in motion events that led to the appointment of former FBI director Robert S Mueller III as a special counsel overseeing the Russia probeTrumps harsh words toward the attorney general fueled speculation this week that Sessions would be fired or would resign So far he has resisted resigning saying that he intends to stay in the job as long as that is appropriate Matt Zapotosky and Julie Tate contributed to this reportThen-Sen Jeff Sessions (R-Ala) spoke twice last year with Russias ambassador to the United States Justice Department officials said encounters he did not disclose when asked about possible contacts between members of President Trumps campaign and representatives of Moscow during Sessionss confirmation hearing to become attorney generalOne of the meetings was a private conversation between Sessions and Russian Ambassador that took place in September in the senators office at the height of what US intelligence officials say was a to upend the US presidential raceThe previously undisclosed discussions could fuel new congressional calls for the  to investigate Russias alleged role in the 2016 presidential election As attorney general Sessions oversees the Justice Department and the FBI which have been leading investigations into Russian meddling and any links to Trumps associates He has so far resisted calls to When Sessions spoke with Kislyak in July and September the senator was a senior member of the influential Armed Services Committee as well as one of Trumps top foreign policy advisers Sessions played a prominent role supporting Trump on the stump after formally joining the campaign in February 2016   At his Jan10 Judiciary Committee  Sessions was asked by Sen Al Franken (D-Minn) what he would do if he learned of any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of the 2016 campaignIm not aware of any of those activities he responded He added I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians   Officials said Sessions did not consider the conversations relevant to the lawmakers questions and did not remember in detail what he discussed with KislyakThere was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer said Sarah Isgur Flores Sessionss spokeswomanIn January Sen Patrick J Leahy (D-Vt) asked Sessions for answers to written questions Several of the President-elects nominees or senior advisers have Russian ties Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election either before or after election day Leahy wroteSessions responded with one word No In a statement issued Wednesday night Sessions said he never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign I have no idea what this allegation is about It is falseJustice officials said Sessions met with Kislyak on Sept8 in his capacity as a member of the armed services panel rather than in his role as a Trump campaign surrogateHe was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign  not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee Flores saidShe added that Sessions last year had more than 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee including the British Korean Japanese Polish Indian Chinese Canadian Australian and German ambassadors in addition to KislyakIn the case of the September meeting one department official who came to the defense of the attorney general said Theres just not strong recollection of what was saidThe Russian ambassador did not respond to requests for comment about his contacts with SessionsThe Washington Post contacted all 26 members of the 2016 Senate Armed Services Committee to see whether any lawmakers besides Sessions met with Kislyak in 2016 Of the 20 lawmakers who responded every senator including Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz) said they did not meet with the Russian ambassador last year The other lawmakers on the panel did not respond as of Wednesday eveningMembers of the committee have not been beating a path to Kislyaks door a senior Senate Armed Services Committee staffer said citing tensions in relations with Moscow Besides Sessions the staffer added There havent been a ton of members who are looking to meet with Kislyak for their committee dutiesLast month The Post reported that Trump national security adviser with Kislyak during the month before Trump took office contrary to public assertions by Mike Pence the vice president-elect and other top Trump officials Flynn was forced to resign the following week    When asked to comment on Sessionss contacts with Kislyak Franken said in a statement to The Post on Wednesday If its true that Attorney General Sessions met with the Russian ambassador in the midst of the campaign then I am very troubled that his response to my questioning during his confirmation hearing was at best misleading Franken added It is now clearer than ever that the attorney general cannot in good faith oversee an investigation at the Department of Justice and the FBI of the Trump-Russia connection and he must recuse himself immediatelySeveral Democratic members of the House on Wednesday night called on Sessions to resign from his post  After lying under oath to Congress about his own communications with the Russians the Attorney General must resign House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) said in a statement adding that Sessions is not fit to serve as the top law enforcement officer of our countrySen Ron Wyden (D-Ore) a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee said on Twitter late Wednesday that we need a special counsel to investigate Trump associates ties to RussiaSen Lindsey O Graham (R-SC) said at a CNN town hall Wednesday night that if the substance of Sessionss conversations with the Russian ambassador proved to be improper or suspect he too would join the call for Sessions to recuse himself from the investigationIf there is something there and it goes up the chain of investigation it is clear to me that Jeff Sessions who is my dear friend cannot make that decision about Trump Graham said  although he stressed that Sessionss contacts with the Russian ambassador could have been innocentBut if theres something there that the FBI thinks is criminal in nature then for sure you need a special prosecutor If that day ever comes Ill be the first one to say it needs to be somebody other than Jeff Current and former US officials say they see Kislyak as a diplomat not an intelligence operative But they were not sure to what extent if any Kislyak was aware of or involved in the covert Russian election campaignSteven Hall former head of Russia operations at the CIA said that Russia would have been keenly interested in cultivating a relationship with Sessions because of his role on key congressional committees and as an early adviser to TrumpSessionss membership on the Armed Services Committee would have made him a priority for the Russian ambassador The fact that he had already placed himself at least ideologically behind Trump would have been an added bonus for Kislyak Hall saidMichael McFaul a Stanford University professor who until 2014 served as US ambassador to Russia said he was not surprised that Kislyak would seek a meeting with Sessions The weird part is to conceal it he said That was at the height of all the discussions of what Russia was doing during the electionTwo months before the September meeting Sessions attended a Heritage Foundation event in July on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention that was attended by about 50 ambassadors When the event was over a small group of ambassadors approached Sessions as he was leaving the podium and Kislyak was among them the Justice Department official said  Sessions then spoke individually to some of the ambassadors including Kislyak the official said In the informal exchanges the ambassadors expressed appreciation for his remarks and some of them invited him to events they were sponsoring said the official citing a former Sessions staffer who was at the eventDemocratic lawmakers including senior members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have demanded in recent weeks that Sessions recuse himself from the governments inquiry into possible ties between Trump associates and RussiaLast week Rep Darrell Issa (R-Calif) a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee became one of the few Republican representatives to state publicly the need for an independent investigationSessionss public position on Russia has evolved over timeIn an  on the sidelines of the German Marshall Funds Brussels Forum in March 2015 Sessions said the United States and Europe have to unify against RussiaMore than a year later he spoke about fostering a stronger relationship with the Kremlin In a July 2016 State of the Union Sessions praised Trumps plan to build better relations with Russian President Vladimir PutinDonald Trump is right We need to figure out a way to end this cycle of hostility thats putting this country at risk costing us billions of dollars in defense and creating hostilities Sessions told CNNAsked whether he viewed Putin as a good or bad leader Sessions told CNN We have a lot of bad leaders around the world that operate in ways we would never tolerate in the United States But the question is can we have a more peaceful effective relationship with Russia Utilizing interests that are similar in a realistic way to make this world a safer place and get off this dangerous hostility with Russia I think its possible Julie Tate Robert Costa and Karoun Demirjian contributed to this reportWhen former president George W Bush was in

if Trump continues to retreat to Mar-a-Lago with some regularity whats the cost to the American taxpayerThe Posts  helps us answer these questions in todays episode Plus we delve into the mystique of the White House the politics of presidential travel and how Trump is challenging some long-standing norms of the highest office in the countryNorth Korea claimed Wednesday that it had successfully tested a hydrogen bomb a claim that if true would mark a huge step forward in its nuclear capabilityWeve carried out a hydrogen bomb test a newsreader on the state-run Korean Central Television station announced in a special broadcast from PyongyangNorth Korea was forced to develop its nuclear arsenal because of the USs hostile policy against North Korea she said  There was some skepticism about the claim with nuclear experts noting that the yield appeared to be similar to North Koreas three previous atomic tests rather than the enormous yield that would be expected if it had been a thermonuclear testWe are aware of seismic activity on the Korean Peninsula in the vicinity of a known North Korean nuclear test site and have seen Pyongyangs claims of a nuclear test said John Kirby a spokesman at the State Department We are monitoring and continuing to assess the situation in close coordination with our regional partnersEither way Pyongyangs provocative action will present a new challenge to the outside world which has struggled to find ways to end North Koreas nuclear defianceNorth Koreas fourth test  in the context of repeated statements by US Chinese and South Korean leaders  throws down the gauntlet to the international community to go beyond paper resolutions and find a way to impose real costs on North Korea for pursuing this course of action said Scott Snyder a Korea expert at the Council on Foreign RelationsKim Jong Uns regime  to defend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nation Some analysts were doubtful saying the young leader appeared primarily concerned with trying to bolster his legitimacyBut on Wednesday North Korea said in a special broadcast that it had carried out a successful hydrogen bomb test With this hydrogen bomb test we have joined the major nuclear powers the newsreader saidHydrogen or thermonuclear bombs are exponentially more powerful and destructive than atomic devices An atomic bomb uses fission to break up the atomic nucleus and release energy while a hydrogen or thermonuclear bomb uses fusion to add to the nucleus This leads to an enormous explosion resulting from an uncontrolled self-sustaining chain reactionKim has repeatedly asserted  and has resolutely refused to return to multilateral talks North Korea had conducted three nuclear tests since 2006 but only one during Kims reign in February 2013 Then there were signs of unusual seismic activity around North Koreas main nuclear test site Wednesday morning sparking fears that Pyongyang ordered the detonation of another atomic device two days before Kims birthdayWe have consistently made clear that we will not accept [North Korea] as a nuclear state Kirby said We will continue to protect and defend our allies in the region including the Republic of Korea and will respond appropriately to any and all North Korean provocationsEarthquake agencies in China Japan and the United States all recorded unusual seismic activity in the northeastern corner of North Korea at 10am local time WednesdayThe US Geological Survey recorded a shallow 51-magnitude quake about 20 miles from the facility at Punggye-ri where North Korea has carried out its three previous nuclear tests  Many analysts have been surprised that such a long period has passed without another test because it is by testing that North Korea can advance its programI think they have a technological path in mind said Jeffrey Lewis a nuclear expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey CalifIn December Lewis noted that satellite pictures showed North Korea appeared to be at its nuclear test site warning that the Pyongyang regime might be preparing to conduct a fourth atomic test There is a lot of tunneling at the test site which could mean they have a bunch of tests planned he saidAlthough analysts were still awaiting more data Lewis said that Wednesdays explosion looked very similar to past tests and was not enormous suggesting it was not a hydrogen bombIn Seoul and Tokyo the governments called emergency national security meetings to discuss the possibility of a nuclear testThis nuclear test by North Korea is a major threat to our countrys security and I absolutely cannot accept it Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday Also it is clearly a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions so  we will take strong measure including steps within the UN Security CouncilJoel Wit a former US diplomat who runs the 38 North website dedicated to North Korea said that the purpose of the test remained unclearWhat is clear is that North Korea is moving forward with its nuclear weapons program and that the United States China and the international community need to come up with more effective ways to deal with this growing threat he said       Yoonjung Seo in Seoul and Yuki Oda in Tokyo contributed to this reportDC Council members said they were gravely

differences out of a joint desire to denuclearize the Korean PeninsulaSouth Koreas Foreign Ministry said the two countries will resume normal relations The two sides attach great importance to the Korea-China relationship a statement from the ministry saidIn its own coordinated statementChinas Foreign Ministry said the two nations would work to put their relationship back on a normal trackas soon as possibleChina and South Korea have historically deep ties and over the past few decades had enjoyed a close relationship However that relationship was deeply damaged last July when Seoul agreed to install the US-owned Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense platform on its landThough both Seoul and Washington argued the THAAD system had only defensive capabilities Beijing was concerned about US encirclement as well as the systems sophisticated radar capabilitiesChinese President Xi Jinping was also angered that former South Korean president Park Geun-hye had sided with American interests over China said Yun Suna senior associate with the East Asia Program at the Stimson CenterXi had tried to sway South Koreas alignment choice and when Park rejected Chinas demand not to deploy THAAD it made Xis great diplomacy on South Korea a failure and an embarrassment Sun said in an email this weekendWhen the missile system was deployed earlier this year Chinas Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang warned that Beijing would resolutely take necessary measures to defend our security interestsSouth Koreas Foreign Ministry acknowledged that the THAAD dispute had not been fully resolvedThe two sides agreed to engage in communication on THAAD-related issues about which the Chinese side is concerned through communication between their military authorities it said in a statementFor its part China confirmed Tuesday that its position on THAAD had not changedAnd on Sunday South Koreas military chief met with his American and Japanese counterparts as part of a growing three-way dialogueChina is South Koreas largest trading partner and it used this economic clout to punish Korean businesses when the antimissile system was deployed Trips by Chinese tour groups to South Korea were suspended with the number of Chinese visitors dropping 60percent in the first nine months of the year compared with 2016 according to figures released by the Bank of KoreaKorean-owned businesses also suffered boycotts and bans in China The situation was especially difficult for the Lotte conglomerate which had allowed its land to be used for the installation of the THAAD system Last month it announced it would be selling off its supermarkets in China after most were shut down for fire code violations and other alleged infractionsPresident Moon Jae-ins new South Korean government had recently made a number of moves to ease Chinas anxiety over THAAD withForeign Minister Kang Kyung-wha announcing last week that South Korea would not seek any more deployments of the system The moves had been received warmly in Chinas state-run press with the nationalist  saying that theproactive stance of Moons government wasa new gesture that is welcomedChoi Kang vice president of the Seoul think tank Asan Institute for Policy Studies said that South Korea had not offered any real concessions on the issueSince South Korea has maintained a very firm position on THAAD the Chinese side decided to move instead Kang saidInstead North Korea and other factors may have led to the agreement between the two nations which came after the Chinese Party Congress that saw Xi consolidate his power over the country and exactly a week before President Trump arrives in South Korea as part of a 12-day Asia tripChina is keen to restart relations with South Korea under Moon said Sun as he has signaled that he is seeking an independent policy and is open to talks with North Korea a long-standing ally of BeijingWhen the relationship with President Park was beyond repair for China Moon gives China new hope Sun wrote However Kang said that the two sides still had different outlooks on the region that could lead to more disputes China and South Korea felt the necessity to manage their bilateral relations for different reasons not for common objectives and concerns Kang saidThe conflict is not over yetNorth Koreas provocations have prompted other shifts in the Pacific as well In one example the senior military officials from the United States South Korea and Japan are incrementally increasing collective ballistic missile defense despite strained relations between South Korea and Japan that date back to Japans invasion of the Korean Peninsula during World War IIOn Sunday Marine Gen Joseph F Dunford Jr the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff met with his South Korean counterpart Gen Jeong Kyeong-doo and their Japanese equivalent Adm Katsutoshi Kawano at the sun-drenched headquarters of US Pacific Command in HawaiiThe Japanese and South

Army Gen Martin E Dempsey On Sunday the agreed to hold quarterly missile defense exercises in 2018 Dunford saidDunford said that the discussions between South Korea and Japan are important for a couple of reasons Number one from a deterrence perspective its important that Kim Jong Un and [North Korea] see that they are facing a collective response from the international community and in particular those nations most affected Dunford said And number two if we do have to respond Japan is a critical ally that the United States is going to need to meet its alliance commitments We have over 50000 forces in Japan It is a platform from which we would project power in any South Korean response Simon Denyer in Beijing and Dan Lamothe in Washington contributed to this reportSouth Korean

scandalElections for a new president must now be held within 60 days and polls point to a change in political direction for South Korea Progressive candidate Moon Jae-in holds a strong lead over the conservatives who were once loyal to ParkThe court dismisses President Park Geun-hye from her position said Lee Jung-mi the acting chief justice delivering the highly anticipated verdict Friday There is no other choice but to decide this verdictPark did not make any comment on the decision and remained in the presidential Blue House on Friday afternoonHwang Kyo-ahn the caretaker prime minister who is now acting president declared South Korea to be in an emergency situation saying he would try to ensure stability and assuage internationalconcernsThe impeachmentmarks a historic moment in a country that adopted democracy only 30 years ago In sharp contrast with South Koreas history of military coups peaceful protests this time led to the removal of an elected leader But supporters of Park wasted no time in venting their anger Friday morning clashing with riot police and breaching cordons around the courtTwo people were reported to have died during the protestsThe case has rocked South Korean society because of the sheer extent of the alleged corruption Not only is the presidential Blue House implicated but also the chiefs of leading companies such as Samsung a high-profile prosecutor and the head of the national pension fund the worlds third-largestThe case comes at a time of high tensions in the region with North Korea firing missiles and issuing threats and an angry China retaliating against South Korea for hostingan American antimissile battery which Beijing views as an effort to curtail ChinaAll eight justices on the Constitutional Court voted to uphold the impeachment motion against Park which passed by an in December The justices said the president had continuously violated the law and the constitutionThe court concluded that the president had helped her friend Choi Soon-sil extract bribes from South Korean conglomerates The negative impact of the presidents legal violations is serious andthe benefits to defending the constitution by dismissing her from office are overwhelmingly large the acting chief justice said in reading out the courts ruling  Analysts had expected the impeachment decisionIt was such an obvious case that there was no room for the court to rule other than impeaching the president said Kim Seon-taek a professor of constitutional law at Korea UniversityThrough the Choi-gate investigation we found serious violations of laws and evidence of meddling with law and order of the nation by both Choi Soon-sil and Park Geun-hye Kim saidBut Parks lawyers vowed to fight onI cannot accept todays conclusion attorney Suh Suk-koo told reporters outside the court saying they would consider appealing The biased Korean media coupled with left-leaning and North Korean sympathizing labor unions have led anti-Park protests to the streets of South KoreaParks supporters mainly older conservative Koreans began protesting outside the court immediately after the decision pushing through riot police and climbing over barricades around the court Several people were seen unconscious on the ground  The political scandal  extraordinary even by the standards of South Koreastumultuous democracy  revolves around Park and her who held no official position but turned out to wield huge influence over the president much more than her official advisers and ministersChoi is accused of extracting bribes from big business  Samsung alone is accused of planning to give her $37 million  in return for using her relationship with the president to ensure favorable treatment for the companiesSpecial prosecutors tasked with investigating the case known here as Choi-gate said in a 101-page report released this week that they had found evidence that the president colluded with Choi Park refused to be questioned by the special prosecutorsProsecutors have recommended 13 charges against Park including abuse ofpower coercion ofdonations and the sharing of state secrets Park had immunity from prosecution while she was in office but has lost that now that she has been removed from the presidencyThe release of the prosecutors report coincided with the conclusion of the Constitutional Courts 10-week-long deliberation on the impeachment case Park declined to appear before the court although she issued statements through her lawyers in which she had steadfastly denied wrongdoingThe case couldnt have been any clearer said Chung Tae-ho of Kyung Hee University With this verdict the Constitutional Court has sent an unequivocal warning to the people in power not to take advantage of their positions and seek personal gains  Park was suspended from office in December after weeks of enormous protests with hundreds of thousands of people packing the streets of Seoul every Saturdaycalling on her to resign or be impeachedThe outrage against her was triggered by revelations that thepresident who seldom consulted with her ministers and official advisers had been taking secret counsel on everything from North Korea policy to her wardrobe choices from a friend who held no official positionMaking matters worse it turned out that Choithe daughter of a shaman cult leaderhad appeared to take advantage of her relationship with the president to enrich herself and win favors for her familyShe is accused of receiving about $70 million in bribes from big business groups Park adamantly denied all the allegationsSamsungs de facto head Lee Jae-yong went on trial Thursday on charges including bribery embezzlement and perjury and Choi has been on trial for monthsBoth strongly deny wrongdoing although at a parliamentary hearing in December Lee admitted that Samsung had given a $900000 horse to Chois daughter an Olympic equestrian hopefulNow that Park has been ousted permanently new elections must be held within 60 daysThe conservative faction is in disarray with the ruling party splitting into those who supported the president and those wanting to distance themselves from herThe latest polls put Moon a progressive from the Democratic Party who ran against Park in the last presidential election in the lead although he is facing a surpriseMoon has taken a much more conciliatory approach toward North Korea than the conservative governments that have held power since 2008 and his election would likely see the resumption of a sunshine policy of engagement with the North  Park 65 is the daughter of former military strongman Park Chung-hee who served as president from 1963 to 1979 and oversaw South Koreas transformation into an economic powerhouse by supporting conglomerates such as Samsung and HyundaiPark Geun-hye has long been considered a kind of princess figure in South Korea and one with a traumatic past While she was in college her mother was killed by a bullet meant for her father shot by a North Korean sympathizer Even today Park wears an old-fashioned hairstyle reminiscent of her mothersShe effectively became South Koreas first lady at 22 and during this time became close to Choi Tae-min the founder of a religious cult that incorporated elements of Christianity and Buddhism He would deliver messages to Park from her dead mother according to local reports A US Embassy cable noted that the local media described Choi as a Korean RasputinPark also became close to Chois daughter Choi Soon-sil and their friendship continued after both their fathers diedParks father still president was killed in 1979 by his own spy chief and Park disappeared from public view for almost two decades             Yoonjung Seo contributed to this reportNorth Koreas pursuit of a nuclear weapons program will only hasten its collapse South Korean President Park Geun-hye said Tuesday forgoing her usual caution to warn in uncharacteristically blunt terms that her government will do all it can to punish Pyongyang for Talk of the Norths collapse is normally a no-go topic here because the prospect not only alarms South Koreans but also enrages Kim Jong Uns irascible regime But following the Norths nuclear and missile tests this year Park is taking a markedly more confrontational approachDear people of South Korea its obvious now that our previous methods and goodwill cannot break Pyongyangs nuclear will she said in a special televised address to the National Assembly I believe we should not provide them with unconditional support anymore or succumb to their provocations We now need to find a fundamental solution to effectively change North Korea and it is our time to be brave Her tough words come at a time when South Korea Japan and the United States are in unusual accord on how to deal with North Korea Her address also coincides with a buildup in US military muscle on the Korean Peninsula Four US F-22 stealth fighter jets are set to arrive in the South on Wednesday while the USS John C Stennis aircraft carrier is due later in the month ahead of joint military exercisesPark has pursued what she calls a trustpolitik approach to North Korea  trying to build trust without weakening deterrence But last week she signaled a significant shift when she ordered the shutdown of the inter-Korean industrial zone at Kaesong on the northern side of the demilitarized zone that separates the two countries    where about 54000 North Koreans worked in 124 South Korean-owned factories had long been kept separate from politics it was not shuttered even after a North Korean attack on a South Korean naval corvette in 2010 that killed 46 South Korean sailorsBut Park citing estimates that the Souths government and private enterprises have contributed $3billion to the Norths government over the past 20 years including through the Kaesong project has pulled the plugThe shutdown was just the start she said Tuesday From now on the government will start taking stronger and more effective measures to push North Korea to make changes by creating an environment in which the North will realize that nuclear development is not a way to ensure its survival but a way to ensure the quick collapse of the regime she saidParks comments including the mention of the Norths collapse took many analysts by surpriseShe has announced a real change in her policy said Choi Kang vice president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies a Seoul think tank She didnt say regime change but it seems that she has something like that in mindThere are few economic avenues left for the South to punish the North The Kumgang tourist area where South Koreans could visit a North Korean mountain range in a project that generated foreign currency for the Kim regime was shut down years ago after a South Korean woman was shot by a North Korean guard  put in place after the 2010 naval attack also curbed economic cooperation and tradeBut there is plenty that South Korea could do militarily Choi said including beefing up the capabilities of its armed forces continuing to blare anti-Kim messages across the DMZ and perhaps even cutting off humanitarian aidThe Souths recent actions  especially the loudspeaker messages  have infuriated the North In a statement last week after the Kaesong shutdown the Norths official Korean Central News Agency labeled Park a confrontational wicked woman operating at the groin of her American bossPyongyang also has been sending anti-South leaflets over the DMZ with balloons Some that landed north of Seoul on Tuesday according to local media featured a caricature of Park and warned of divine vengeance for what it said were her failures including the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking in which hundreds died the high suicide rate and a MERS outbreak The leaflet featured death portraits of Parks mother who was shot by a North Korean agent and her father former president Park Chung-hee who was assassinated suggesting that her turn was nextSeparately Japan has introduced new unilateral economic sanctions against North Korea in response to the tests banning its citizens from entering Japan and North Korean ships from calling at Japanese ports Transfers of money also will be restrictedIn Washington the House and Senate have  against North Korea and it is now awaiting President Obamas signatureBut China the Norths closest ally has been reluctant to take punitive action that would risk destabilizing its neighbor a stance that is likely to weaken any measures that the United Nations comes up with Yoonjung Seo contributed to this reportStephen Colbert may have offered the definitive takedown Monday night of Donald Trumps In a more than10-minute segment Colbert repeatedly called Trump a liar without directly saying so using clips of Trump himself saying liar and world-class liar and talking in exasperated tones about Trumps bogus birtherism claimsin a Friday newsconferenceTrump said Friday in  that he ended the birther controversy in 2011 by getting President Obama to release his birth certificate and that Hillary Clinton and her campaign actually first raised the questions about whether Obama was

criminal underworld Every criminal knows Keyser Sze and fears him even though no one has met him and he may not technically existThe movie rocketed Kevin Spacey to an Academy Award and in the last two

like in the movie all the clues click in the end Overwhelmed by the revelation the investigator drops his mug spilling coffeeOn the bottom of the shattered pieces Trump/Putin 2016Stephen Colbert dropped the L word (lie) and the F word (you know) on the Trump White House on Monday night It was the late-night comedians latest blast of politically charged commentary primarily directed at the 45th president And it was the kind of performance that just a short time ago seemed to risk alienating large numbers of potential viewers but now appears to be making the Late Show host a very big drawColbert lampooned White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller who on his tour of the Sunday political talk shows assertedthat the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questionedWill not be questioned Let me test that theory Colbert said What the f--- are you talking aboutColbert then challenged Miller who said he is prepared to go on any show anytime anywhere to appear on Tuesdays Late ShowListen if you dont show up Im going to call you a liar Colbert said And if you do show up Im going to call you a liar to your faceMiller did not showWith forceful remarks like this Colbert  on late-night king Jimmy Fallon who is far less inclined to take on the president in a harsh mannerConventional wisdom is that Fallons approach works best on a major broadcast network When the  of late-night viewers in the fall of 2015 shortly after Colberts debut on CBS it found that Fallon appealed to people across the political spectrum The Tonight Show hosts audience was 36 percent Democrat 31 percent Republican and 27 percent independentColberts audience skewed sharply to the left 47 percent Democrat 17 percent Republican and 31 percent independentA liberal slanthelped make Colbert a star on Comedy Central but CBS executives made it clear that they expected Mr Colbert to broaden his appeal when he moved to the medium of late night on a network the  at the time of his hiringColbert however was among Trumps  during the campaign and never really moderated his politics Ratings throughout his first year on the Late Show were  much to the delight of conservative publications such as the Weekly Standard which  Colberts early struggles sweet schadenfreudeAbsent another survey of late-night audiences it is unclear what exactly has reversed Colberts fortunes Are liberal viewers tuning in in greater numbers Or is Colbert bringing in conservatives who were uncomfortable with Trump during the campaign and who feel unnerved by his fledgling administrationIt is worth noting that Colberts skewering of Miller on Monday night had little to do with liberal or conservative policy ideas it was about a claim to unchecked power which could alarm anybodyWell see whether Colbert can sustain his recent success But if he was waiting for ratings to catch up to his vision for the Late Show his patience is being rewarded for nowThe first

very fake news media  while promoting some dubious claims and  they reported The media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges we made and theyre not happy about it for whatever reason Trump said at Thursdays news conferenceDean said Nixon made those kind of comments that we only know about because he had his secret taping system running and

going to wiretap them and surveil them to find out who was leakingIn his interview Dean delves into a bigger question If Trumphas so many parallels with Nixon will his presidency end in similar

process And were not there yetAs a service to readers bound to be confused by an increasinglycomplex story heres a brief guide to the latest developments in the tangled allegations involving Russia President Trump and Hillary Clinton The dossier is  concerning President Trump and Russia written by Christopher Steele a former British intelligence officer between June 20 and Dec 13 2016 Steele produced his memos under a contract with Fusion GPS The memos are  based on interviews Steele had with unidentified Russian sources (identified for instance as Kremlin insider) some of whom he paid for information Raw intelligence is essentially high-grade gossip without the expectation it would be made public unless it is further verifiedThe memos among other things allege the Russian government had been seeking to split the Western alliance by cultivating and supporting Trump and also gathering compromising information  kompromat  on him in an effort to blackmail him The memos among other allegations claim the Russian government fed the Trump campaign valuable intelligence on Clinton The dossier mirrors a separate conclusion by US intelligence agencies that the Russian government intervened in the US election in an effort to bolster Trump and harm Clinton such as through hacking the Democratic National Committee and distributing materials to WikiLeaks to publish at key moments As the  statedWe assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election Russias goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process denigrate Secretary Clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump We have high confidence in these judgmentsRussian President Vladimir Putin intensely disliked Clinton because he was convinced that when she was secretary of state she had promoted anti-Putin pro-democracy efforts in his country The FBI considered the information gathered by Steele to be of sufficient importance that it  although it later dropped the idea The DNC and Clinton campaign  as the Democratic donors who paid Fusion GPS for Steeles research (Technically Perkins Coie the law firm of Marc Elias an attorney representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC funded the research)Separately a Republican donor who had earlier hired Fusion GPS for information on Trump  to be the Washington Free Beacon a conservative website But that earlier effort is unrelated to the Democratic-funded research that yielded the dossier as Steele was hired by Fusion GPS after work for the Free Beacon had endedWe should note that in another assignment Fusion had been hired by a US law firm in early 2014 to assist on the defense against a civil action filed by the US government alleging fraud by Prevezon Holdings Prevezon is owned by Denis Katsyv the son of a senior Russian government officialWhy is that relevant Natalia Veselnitskaya who was also working for the law firm on the Prevezon case met with Trump campaign officials at the Trump Tower in June 2016 including Donald Trump Jr campaign manager Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner the husband of Ivanka Trump Donald Trump Jr agreed to meet with Veselnitskaya after an intermediary promised dirt on Clinton She arrived with a memo containing by Yuri Chaika Russias prosecutor general who is known as a master of kompromat The Trump White House has between the dossier andClinton to claim that this shows that rather than Trump colluding with Russia Clinton colluded with Russia (The theory appears to be that because Steele was getting information from Russian officials in part with funds provided by the Clinton campaign the Russians were helping Clinton)But that ignores the fact that DNC emails  as well as the email account of the Clinton campaign chairman  were hacked and then published by WikiLeaks as part of the pro-Trump Russian operation identified byUS intelligence agencies (Wikileaks denies it received the material from Russia) Indeed the Wall Street Journal  that a prominent Trump donor and the chief executive of a data-analytics firm working for Trumps presidential campaign in August 2016 discussed how to better organize the Clinton-related emails being released by Wikileaks in order to leverage their impactSteele started producing his memos in June 2016 about the same time that intelligence agencies began investigating possible ties between Russia and people close to Trump The connection between Steeles research and official government investigations is murky but for some Republicans it raises questions about whether the official probe begun in the Obama administration was influenced by information gathered by someone being paid by DemocratsCNN for instance that the FBI used information in the Steele memos to obtain approval from the secret court that oversees the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to monitor the communications of Carter Page who Trump had said was a key adviser on national security issues Presumably the FBI had verified the information before it could cite it in court Steele had quoted an ethnic Russian close associate of Trump as saying Page was an intermediary in a well-developed conspiracy of co-operation between the Trump campaign and the Russian leadership Page has adamantly denied any wrongdoingSteele during the campaign at Fusions direction also briefed reporters from some US news organizations including The Washington Post on his findings  Only one publication Mother Jones  based on the briefing before the election In 2010 Rosatom the Russian nuclear energy agency acquired a controlling stake in Uranium One a Canadian-based company that had mining licenses at the time for about 20 percent of US uranium extraction capacity (Note   and the United States as a whole extracts relatively little uranium) The agreement was approved by the Obama administration when Clinton was secretary of stateFrank Giustra a Canadian mining financier and a major contributor to the Clinton Foundation had sold a company UrAsia to Uranium One in 2007 Individuals related to Uranium One and UrAsia including Giustra donated to the Clinton Foundation totaling about $145 million though most of the donations took place before and during her 2008 presidential run Meanwhile in 2010 Bill Clinton received $500000 from a Russian bank to give a speech at a conference in MoscowTrump during the campaign tossed all of these separate facts together to falsely claim that Clinton gave 20 percent of our uranium  gave Russia for a big payment But numerous fact checks have  for this claim The original suggestion of wrongdoing was first raised in a book underwritten by an organization headed by Stephen K Bannon a key adviser to Trump Whenever news about the Russia investigation heats up the Trump White House cites the uranium deal in an effort to muddy the waters and suggest that Russia had gained something from Clinton in exchange for money Trump himself has claimed the case is Watergate modern ageBut there is no evidence Clinton even was informed about this deal The Treasury Department was the key agency that headed the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States which approved the investment Clinton did not participate in the CFIUS decision The deal was also approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Ultimately only the president could have blocked or suspended the arrangementMoreover no uranium produced at Uranium Ones US mines may be exported except for some uranium yellowcake which is extracted and processed in Canada before being returned to the United States for use in nuclear power plants[The Hill newspaperon Nov 2 that some of the uranium from Uranium One facilities was exported to Europe We had noted before that the uranium could not be exported with the exception of yellowcake being shipped to Canada for conversion with the expectation it would be returned to the United States But once Uranium Ones material arrived in Canada it apparently was mixed with yellowcake from other suppliers  and then Canada received permission from the Energy Department to send converted USuraniumto Europe for enrichment Uranium One says it sold about 25 percent of its US-extracted yellowcake via book transfer to customers overseaswhich does not necessarily mean the material moved because ownership in commodity markets is not the same as possession US officials say it is unknown whether any uranium extracted by Uranium One was transferred overseas] The Hill newspaper on Oct 22 the FBI had gathered evidence at the time of the sale that a Russian Rosatom official had conducted a massive bribery scheme compromising an American trucking company that shipped uranium for Russia The official eventually  but Republicans have said the case  about the Rosatom investment in Uranium One and possibly blocked the deal But there is no evidence that US officials weighing the transaction knew about the FBI investigationThe reporting prompted House Republicans to announce they would launch an investigation With  the Justice Department gave a former FBI informant in the case approval to testify before Congress The informants lawyer claimed he would discuss his work uncovering the Russian nuclear bribery case and the efforts he witnessed by Moscow to gain influence with [former president Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton] in hopes of winning favorable uranium decisions from the Obama administration Any suggestion that Russian money was directed to influence Clintons decisions would be explosive But the fatal flaw in this allegation is Hillary Clinton by all accounts did not participate in any discussions regarding the Uranium One sale which  as we noted  does not actually result in the removal of uranium from the United States()Hillary Clintons involvement with a Russian uranium deal has come under scrutiny since author and Breitbart News senior editor-at-large Peter Schweizer dedicated a chapter to the topic in his 2015 book Clinton Cash The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary RichThe Trump campaign has been attacking Clinton over the uranium deal lately perhaps as a way to distract attention from criticism of Trumps interest in fostering a closer relationship with Russia Clinton Cash was made into a graphic novel and a documentary and on Oct 20 makers of the graphic novel released an  about the uranium deal FactCheckorg and PolitiFact have covered the facts and we wrote about the deal briefly in a  But with the renewed attention this month we decided to take a deeper look at Clintons role in this dealThe Trump campaign pointed to an  about this deal based on a preview of Clinton Cash The Times said it scrutinized his [Schweizers] information and built upon it with its own reportingThe story starts with Frank Giustra a Canadian mining financier and donor to the Clinton Foundation Giustras company UrAsia and Uranium One a uranium mining company headquartered in TorontoIn 2007 Giustra sold UrAsia to Uranium One which was based in South Africa and chaired by his friend Ian Telfer Giustra said he in the deal in fall 2007 shortly after the merger with Uranium One in the midst of Clintons 2008 presidential campaign and before Clinton realizedBarack Obama would win the nomination and she would become his secretary of stateIn 2009 Russias nuclear energy agency Rosatom began buying shares in Uranium One as a part of a larger move to acquire mines around the world Rosatom first bought a 17 percent share of Uranium One which has holdings in the United States In 2010 the Russians sought to increase their share to 51 percent The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the deal In 2013 Russia assumed 100 percent ownershipThe deal gave Russia control of about 20 percent of US uranium extraction capacity according to a  about the deal In other words Russia has rights to the uranium extracted at those sites which represents 20 percent of the US uranium production capacityThe State Department was one of nine agencies comprising CFIUS which vets potential national security impacts of transactions where a foreign government gains control of a US company It was established by Congress in 2007 after the controversy over the planned purchase of seaports by a company in United Arab Emirates The other agencies were the departments of Treasury Defense Justice Commerce Energy and Homeland Security andtwo White House agencies (Office of the US Trade Representative and Office of Science and Technology Policy)The CFIUS can approve a deal but  can suspend or stop a transaction If the committee cant come to a consensus a member can recommend a suspension or prohibition of the deal and the president makes the callDue to confidentiality laws there are few details made public about the deal or about Clintons role in it  The Clinton campaign  Clinton herself was not involved in the State Departments review and did not direct the department to take any position on the sale of Uranium One Matters of the CFIUS did not rise to the level of the secretary the campaign saidJose Fernandez then-assistant secretary of state for economic energy and business affairs sat on the committee Fernandez told the Times Mrs Clinton never intervened with me on any CFIUS matter Fernandez did not respond to our requests for commentHillarys opposition [to the Uranium One deal] would have been enough under CFIUS rules to have the decision on the transaction kicked up to the president That never happened Schweizer wrote in Clinton CashAt the time the sale was underway the Obama administration was  its relations with Russia with Clinton leading the effort as secretary of state But there is no evidence approval of the sale was connected to the reset policy The national security concern that the United States faced when CFIUS considered the deal concerned American dependence on foreign uranium sources the Times reportedYet the Uranium One deal was not on the radar ofMichael McFaul even though he was aware of many CFIUS cases in his role as the National Security Councils senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs from 2009 to 2012 (and as a prime architect of the administrations reset policy) McFaul now senior fellow at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institution said Fernandez could not dictate the outcome of any decision single-handedly as he was one of nine membersKnowing how the CFIUS process works and how the bureaucracy at the State Department works I cannot imagine that such an issue would be reviewed by the secretary of state There is a hierarchy in place precisely to protect the secretarys time for only the most important of issues and meetings McFaul saidI was not personally involved because that wasnt something the secretary of state did Clinton told  in June 2015Some Republican lawmakers in 2010 did raise concerns about the deal  but they  to then-Treasury Secretary Timothy F Geithner () Final approval  which noted that the mines would remain under the control of US subsidiaries Neither Uranium One nor ARMZ [the Russian firm] holds an NRC export license so no uranium produced at either facility may be exported the NRC said (Some uranium yellowcake is extracted processed in Canada and returned to the United States)We asked the Trump campaign for evidence that Clinton or the State Department had more of a role in the deal than any of the eight other member agencies of CFIUS and did not receive a responseDid the Clintons get paid for the Russian dealThe Trump campaign pointed todonations to the Clinton Foundation as reported by the Times Giustra became friends with Bill Clinton in 2005 over their charity work The Washington Post took an  at their ties and described their friendship as one that has helped propel the Clinton Foundation into a global giant and established Giustras reputation as an international philanthropist while helping him build connections in countries where his business was expandingGiustra eventually became one of the largest individual donors to the Clinton Foundation His relationship with the Clintons came under scrutiny over donors to the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada) which raises money for the similarly named Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership one of the Clinton Foundations initiatives (For more on this read more about it  and )Individuals related to Uranium One and UrAsia including Giustra and Telfer donated to the Clinton Foundation totaling about $145 million The Times reported that Telfer also donated to the Clinton Foundation using his family charity based in Canada These were donations made to the Clinton Foundation not directly to the ClintonsAs  the majority of these donations were made before and during Clintons 2008 presidential run So Trumps claim that Hillary Clinton gave [uranium to] Russia for a big payment is not accurate If she had actually become president she would have had more power over the deal than as the head of one agency among nine represented on CFIUSThe Trump campaign also noted that Bill Clinton received speaking fees while the Uranium One deal was underway After the Russians announced that they would acquire stakes in Uranium One and while the Kremlin was promoting the purchase Bill Clinton received $500000 in 2010 for a speech in Moscow from a Russian investment bank that had ties to the Kremlin Putin personally thanked Clinton  adding that a review of Bill Clintons speeches found no evidence that speaking fees were paid to the former president in exchange for any action by Mrs ClintonThe Times also did not report a direct link between Bill Clinton and the deal The banks analysts talked up Uranium Ones stock while the deal was under CFIUS consideration and assigned it a buy rating The bank would not comment on the genesis of Mr Clintons speech to an audience that included leading Russian officials or on whether it was connected to the Rosatom deal the Times reportedTrump and his campaign claim that Clinton gave or handed over 20 percent of American uranium rights to the Russians Through the Uranium One deal the Russian state-owned nuclear energy company does now have control over 20 percent of US uranium extraction capacity But it cannot export the uraniumIn 2010 the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States approved the sale of the majority of the shares to the Russians The State Department was one of nine agencies on the committee that approved the deal The deal was also separately approved by the Nuclear Regulatory CommissionThere is no evidence Clinton herself got involved in the deal personally and it is highly questionable that this deal even rose to the level of the secretary of stateTheoretically as Schweizer says Clinton could have intervened But even then it ultimately would have been Obamas decision whether to suspend or block the dealWe wavered between Three and Four Pinocchios Trump so often uses broad-brushed language that pushes him into Four Pinocchio territory and this is yet another one of those cases He specifically names Hillary Clinton as the active agent in the Uranium One deal saying she gave them or handed over uranium to the Russians but that is not the case Then he further claimed the sale went forward in exchange for a big payment Theres no evidence for that claim eitherTrump could have avoided so many Pinocchios had he been more careful with the language For example Hillary Clintons State Department was one of nine agencies that approved the deal Words matter()How would you rate this claim (The check mark means you think the statement is true not that you agree with the rating)We need to verify that you are an actual person This is a non-scientific user poll Results are not statistically valid and cannot be assumed to reflect the views of

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes a Republican lawmaker from California echoed what seems like the administrations line over the weekendThis is almost like McCarthyism revisited said Nunes to reporters in California  to oversee an investigationWere going to go on a witch hunt against innocent AmericansOn Monday Nunes once more attempted to  away from the White House Theres been major crimes committed said Nunes referring to leaks from the intelligence community that spurred the Russia allegations What Im concerned about is no one is focusing on major leaks that have occurred here  We cant run a government like this A government cant function with massive leaks at the highest levelFirst the cries of McCarthyism fromNunes and other Republicanswere first utteredby figures on the American far-left last year They lambasted liberal supporters of Hillary Clinton for  instead of properly reckoning with the  Now two camps from the opposite sides of

opportunistically channeling the fears of the moment Both men would have happily taken up some other cause had it offered them a path to fame and power wrote Beinart It was their own party and political elites more generally who bred the hostility and fear that they exploited the Trumpadministrationtried to compel CIA officials and Republican politicians to push back on the Russia story in conversations with reporters Efforts by the White House to spin this story their way before the investigation has run its course  and efforts by congressional Republicans to prop up that spin  are already looking like ham-handed political interference While Nunes argued there was nothing much to investigate his Democratic colleague on the House Intelligence Committee Rep Adam Schiff of California  that no meaningful investigation has yet taken place He and other lawmakers are demanding hearings thatwould compel agencies like the FBI to clarify what they know and dont know about

Columbia chargesAt all times relevant to this Indictment1 Defendants PAUL J MANAFORT JR (MANAFORT) and RICHARD W GATES III (GATES) served for years as political consultants and lobbyists Between at least 2006 and 2015 MANAFORT and GATES acted as unregistered agents of the Government of Ukraine the Party of Regions (a Ukrainian political party whose leader Victor Yanukovych was President from 2010 to 2014) Yanukovych and the Opposition Bloc (a successor to the Party of Regions that formed in 2014 when Yanukovych fled to Russia) MANAFORT and GATES generated tens of millions of dollars in income as a result of their Ukraine work In order to hide Ukraine payments from United States authorities from approximately 2006 through at least 2016 MANAFORT and GATES laundered the money through scores of United States and foreign corporations partnerships and bank accounts2 In furtherance of the scheme MANAFORT and GATES funneled millions of dollars in payments into foreign nominee companies and bank accounts opened by them and their accomplices in nominee names and in various foreign countries including Cyprus Saint Vincent the Grenadines (Grenadines) and the Seychelles MANAFORT and GATES hid the existence of the foreign companies and bank accounts falsely and repeatedly reporting to their tax preparers and to the United States that they had no foreign bank accounts3 In furtherance of the scheme MANAFORT and GATES concealed from the United States their work as agents of and millions of dollars in payments from Ukraine and its political parties and leaders Because MANAFORT and GATES among other things directed a campaign to lobby United States officials on behalf of the Government of Ukraine the President of Ukraine and Ukrainian political parties they were required by law to report to the United States their work and fees MANAFORT and GATES did not do so Instead when the Departmentof Justice sent inquiries to MANAFORT and GATES in 2016 about their activities MANAFORT and GATES responded with a series of false and misleading statements4 In furtherance of the scheme MANAFORT used his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States without paying taxes on that income MANAFORT without reporting the income to his tax preparer or the United States spent millions of dollars on luxury goods and services for himself and his extended family through payments wired from offshore nominee accounts to United States vendors MANAFORT also used these offshore accounts to purchase multi-million dollar properties in the United States MANAFORT then borrowed millions of dollars in loans using these properties as collateral thereby obtaining cash in the United States without reporting and paying taxes on the income In order to increase the amount of money he could access in the United States MANAFORT defrauded the institutions that loaned money on these properties so that they would lend him more money at more favorable rates than he would otherwise be able to obtain5 GATES aided MANAFORT in obtaining money from these offshore accounts which he was instrumental in opening Like MANAFORT GATES used money from these offshore accounts to pay for his personal expenses including his mortgage childrens tuition and interior decorating of his Virginia residence6 In total more than $75000000 flowed through the offshore accounts MANAFORT laundered more than $18000000 which was used by him to buy property goods and services in the United States income that he concealed from the United States Treasury the Department of Justice and others GATES transferred more than $3000000 from the offshore accounts to other accounts that he controlled7 MANAFORT was a United States citizen He resided in homes in Virginia Florida and Long Island New York8 GATES was a United States citizen He resided in Virginia9 In 2005 MANAFORT and another partner created Davis Manafort Partners Inc (DMP) to engage principally in political consulting DMP had staff in the United States Ukraine and Russia In 2011 MANAFORT created DMP International LLC (DMI) to engage in work for foreign clients in particular political consulting lobbying and public relations for the Government of Ukraine the Party of Regions and members of the Party of Regions DMI was a partnership solely owned by MANAFORT and his spouse GATES worked for both DMP and DMI and served as MANAFORTs right-hand man10 The Party of Regions was a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine Beginning in approximately 2006 it retained MANAFORT through DMP and then DMI to advance its interests in Ukraine including the election of its slate of candidates In 2010 its candidate for President Yanukovych was elected President of Ukraine In 2014 Yanukovych fled Ukraine for Russia in the wake of popular protests of widespread governmental corruption Yanukovych the Party of Regions and the Government of Ukraine were MANAFORT DMP and DMI clients11 The European Centre for a Modern Ukraine (the Centre) was created in or about 2012 in Belgium as a mouthpiece for Yanukovych and the Party of Regions The Centre was used by MANAFORT GATES and others in order to lobby and conduct a public relations campaign in the United States and Europe on behalf of the existing Ukraine regime The Centre effectively ceased to operate upon the downfall of Yanukovych in 201412 MANAFORT and GATES owned or controlled the following entities which were used in the scheme (the MANAFORT-GATES entities)()13 The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was a bureau in the United States Department of the Treasury responsible for administering the tax laws of the United States and collecting taxes owed to the Treasury14 Between in or around 2008 and 2017 both dates being approximate and inclusive in the District of Columbia and elsewhere MANAFORT and GATES devised and intended to devise and executed and attempted to execute a scheme and artifice to defraud and to obtain money and property by means of false and fraudulent pretenses representations and promises from the United States banks and other financial institutions As part of the scheme MANAFORT and GATES repeatedly provided false information to financial bookkeepers tax accountants and legal counsel among others15 In order to use the money in the offshore nominee accounts of the MANAFORT-GATES entities without paying taxes on it MANAFORT and GATES caused millions of dollars in wire transfers from these accounts to be made for goods services and real estate They did not report these transfers as income to DMP DMI or MANAFORT16 From 2008 to 2014 MANAFORT caused the following wires totaling over $12000000 to be sent to the vendors listed below for personal items MANAFORT did not pay taxes on this income which was used to make the purchases()17 In 2012 MANAFORT caused the following wires to be sent to the entities listed below to purchase the real estate also listed below MANAFORT did not report the money used to make these purchases on his 2012 tax return()18 It is illegal to act as an agent of a foreign principal engaged in certain United States influence activities without registering the affiliation Specifically a person who engages in lobbying or public relations work in the United States (hereafter collectively referred to as lobbying) for a foreign principal such as the Government of Ukraine or the Party of Regions is required to providea detailed written registration statement to the United States Department of Justice The filing made under oath must disclose the name of the foreign principal the financial payments to the lobbyist and the measures undertaken for the foreign principal among other information A person required to make such a filing must further make in all lobbying material a conspicuous statement that the materials are distributed on behalf of the foreign principal among other things The filing thus permits public awareness and evaluation of the activities of a lobbyist who acts as an agent of a foreign power or foreign political party in the United States19 In furtherance of the scheme from 2006 until 2014 both dates being approximate and inclusive MANAFORT and GATES engaged in a multi-million dollar lobbying campaign in the United States at the direction of Yanukovych the Party of Regions and the Government of Ukraine MANAFORT and GATES did so without registering and providing the disclosures required by law20 As part of the scheme in February 2012 MANAFORT and GATES solicited two Washington DC firms (Company A and Company B) to lobby in the United States on behalf of Yanukovych the Party of Regions and the Government of Ukraine For instance GATES wrote to Company A that it would be representing the Government of Ukraine in [Washington] DC21 MANAFORT repeatedly communicated in person and in writing with Yanukovych and GATES passed on directions to Company A and Company B For instance MANAFORT wrote Yanukovych a memorandum dated April 8 2012 in which he provided Yanukovych an update on the lobbying firms activities since the inception of the project a few weeks ago It is my intention to provide you with a weekly update moving forward Toward the end of that first year in November 2012 GATES wrote to Company A and Company B that the firms needed to prepare an assessment of their past and prospective lobbying efforts so the President could be briefed by Paul on what Ukraine has done well and what it can do better as we move into 201322 At the direction of MANAFORT and GATES Company A and Company B engaged in extensive lobbying Among other things they lobbied multiple Members of Congress and their staffs about Ukraine sanctions the validity of Ukraine elections and the propriety of Yanukovychs imprisoning his presidential rival Yulia Tymoshenko (who had served as Ukraine President prior to Yanukovych) MANAFORT and GATES also lobbied in connection with the roll out of a report concerning the Tymoshenko trial commissioned by the Government of Ukraine MANAFORT and GATES used one of their offshore accounts to funnel $4 million to pay secretly for the report23 To minimize public disclosure of their lobbying campaign MANAFORT and GATES arrangedfor the Centre to be the nominal client of Company A and Company B even though in fact the Centre was under the ultimate direction of the Government of Ukraine Yanukovych and the Party of Regions For instance MANAFORT and GATES selected Company A and Company B and only thereafter did the Centre sign contracts with the lobbying firms without ever meeting either company Company A and Company B were paid for their services not by their nominal client the Centre but solely through off-shore accounts associated with the MANAFORT-GATES entities namely Bletilla Ventures Limited (in Cyprus) and Jeunet Ltd and Global Endeavour Inc (in Grenadines) In total Company A and Company B were paid more than $2 million from these accounts between 2012 and 201424 To conceal the scheme MANAFORT and GATES developed a false and misleading cover story that would distance themselves and the Government of Ukraine Yanukovych and the Party of Regions from the Centre Company A and Company B For instance in the wake of extensive press reports on MANAFORT and his connections with Ukraine on August 16 2016 GATES communicated false talking points to Company B in writing includingCompany B through a principal replied to GATES the same day that theres a lot of email traffic that has you much more involved than this suggests [] We will not disclose that but heaven knows what former employees of [Company B] or [Company A] might say25 In September 2016 after numerous recent press reports concerning MANAFORT the Department of Justice informed MANAFORT GATES and DMI that it sought to determine whether they had acted as agents of a foreign principal under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) without registering In November 2016 and February 2017 MANAFORT GATES and DMI caused false and misleading letters to be submitted to the Department of Justice which mirrored the false cover story set out above The letters both of which were approved by MANAFORT and GATES before they were submitted represented among other things that26 In fact MANAFORT and GATES had selected Company A and Company B engaged in weekly scheduled calls and frequent emails with Company A and Company B to provide them directions as to specific lobbying steps that should be taken sought and received detailed oral and written reports from these firms on the lobbying work they had performed communicated with Yanukovych to brief him on their lobbying efforts both congratulated and reprimanded Company A and Company B on their lobbying work communicated directly with United States officials in connection with this work and paid the lobbying firms over $2 million from offshore accounts they controlled among other things In addition court-authorized searches of MANAFORT and GATES DMI email accounts and MANAFORTs Virginia residence in July 2017 revealed numerous documents including documents related to lobbying which were more than thirty-days old at the time of the November 2016 letter to the Department of Justice27 United States citizens who have authority over certain foreign bank accounts  whether or not the accounts are set up in the names of nominees who act for their principals  have reporting obligations to the United States28 First the Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations require United States citizens to report to the United States Treasury any financial interest in or signatory authority over any bank account or other financial account held in foreign countries for every calendar year in which the aggregate balarice of all such foreign accounts exceeds $10000 at any point during the year This is commonly known as a foreign bank account report or FBAR The Bank Secrecy Act requires these reports because they have a high degree of usefulness in criminal tax or regulatory investigations or proceedings The United States Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is the custodian for FBAR filings and FinCEN provides access to its FBAR database to law enforcement entities including the Federal Bureau of Investigation The reports filed by individuals and businesses are used by law enforcement to identify detect and deter money laundering that furthers criminal enterprise activity tax evasion and other unlawful activities29 Second United States citizens also are obligated to report information to the IRS regarding foreign bank accounts For instance in 2010 Form 1040 Schedule B had a Yes or No box to record an answer to the question At any time during [the calendar year] did you have an interest in or a signature or other authority over a financial account in a foreign country such as a bank account securities account or other financial account If the answer was Yes then the form required the taxpayer to enter the name of the foreign country in which the financial account was located30 For each year in or about and between 2008 through at least 2014 MANAFORT had authority over foreign accounts that required an FBAR report Specifically MANAFORT was required to report to the United States Treasury each foreign bank account held by the foreign MANAFORT-GATES entities noted above in paragraph 12 that bear the initials PM No FBAR reports were made by MANAFORT for these accounts31 For each year in or about and between 2008 through at least 2013 GATES had authority over foreign accounts that required an FBAR report Specifically GATES was required to report to the United States Treasury each foreign bank account held by the foreign MANAFORT-GATES entities noted above in paragraph 12 that bear the initials RG as well as three other accounts in the United Kingdom No FBAR reports were made by GATES for these accounts32 Furthermore in each of MANAFORTs tax filings for 2008 through 2014 MANAFORT represented falsely that he did not have authority over any foreign bank accounts MANAFORT and GATES had repeatedly and falsely represented in writing to MANAFORTs tax preparer that MANAFORT had no authority over foreign bank accounts knowing that such false representations would result in false MANAPORT tax filings For instance on October 4 2011 MANAFORTs tax preparer asked MANAFORT in writing At any time during 2010 did you [or your wife or children] have an interest in or a signature or other authority over a financial account in a foreign country such as a bank account securities account or other financial account On the same day MANAFORT falsely responded NO MANAPORT responded the same way as recently as October 3 2016 when MANAFORTs tax preparer again emailed the question in connection with the preparation of MANAFORTs tax returns Foreign bank accounts etc MANAPORT responded on or about the same day NONE33 After MANAFORT used his offshore accounts to purchase real estate in the United States he took out mortgages on the properties thereby allowing MANAFORT to have the benefits of liquid income without paying taxes on it Further MANAPORT defrauded the banks that loaned him the money so that he could withdraw more money at a cheaper rate than he otherwise would have been permitted34 In 2012 MANAFORT through a corporate vehicle called MC Soho Holdings LLC owned by him and his family bought a condominium on Howard Street in the Soho neighborhood in Manhattan New York He paid approximately $2850000 All the money used to purchase the condominium came from MANAFORT entities in Cyprus MANAFORT used the property from at least January 2015 through 2016 as an income-generating rental property charging thousands of dollars a week on Airbnb among other places In his tax returns MANAFORT took advantage of the beneficial tax consequences of owning this rental property35 In late 2015 through early 2016 MANAFORT applied for a mortgage on the condominium Because the bank would permit a greater loan amount if the property were owner-occupied MANAFORT falsely represented to the bank and its agents that it was a secondary home used as such by his daughter and son-in-law and was not a property held as a rental property For instance on January 26 2016 MANAFORT wrote to his son-in-law to advise him that when the bank appraiser came to assess the condominium his son-in-law should [r]emember he believes that you and [MANAFORTs daughter] are living there Based on a request from MANAFORT GATES caused a document to be created which listed the Howard Street property as the second home of MANAFORTs daughter and son-in-law when GATES knew this fact to be false As a result of his false representations in March 2016 the bank provided MANAFORT a loan for approximately $318500036 Also in 2012 MANAFORT  through a corporate vehicle called MC Brooklyn Holdings LLC similarly owned by him and his family  bought a brownstone on Union Street in the CarrollGardens section of Brooklyn New York He paid approximately $3000000 in cash for the property All of that money carne from a MANAFORT entity in Cyprus After purchase of the property MANAFORT began renovations to transform it from a multi-family dwelling into a single family home In late 2015 through early 2016 MANAFORT sought to borrow cash against the property The institution MANAFORT went to for the loan provided greater loan amounts for construction loans  that is loans that required the loan amounts to be used to pay solely for construction of the property and thus increase the value of the property serving as the loans collateral The institution would thus loan money against the expected completed value of the property which in the case of the Union Street property was estimated to be $8000000 In early 2016 MANAFORT was able to obtain a loan of approximately $5000000 after promising the bank that approximately $1400000 of the loan would be used solely for construction of the Union Street property However MANAFORT never intended to limit use of the proceeds to construction as required by the loan contracts In December 2015 before the loan was made MANAFORT wrote his tax preparer among others that the construction loan will allow me to pay back the [another Manafort apartment] mortgage in full Further when the construction loan closed MANAFORT used hundreds of thousands of dollars from the construction loan to make a down payment on another property in California37 Paragraphs 1 through 30 and 32 through 36 are incorporated here38

the medias portrayal of inauguration crowds President Trumps new press secretary Sean Spicer espoused  during his first news conference  eliciting groans from critics wary of four years of what  as alternative factsBut a few brave souls chose to go high on social media and look at the positive aspects of living in Spicers worldHow wonderful would it be to use #AlternativeFactsin our everyday livesIt could be the best news since  last yearAnd just like that #SeanSpicerSays and #SeanSpicerFacts were bornI ate a salad for lunch today  Mari Dwyer (@maridwy) Guess the number of jelly beansMe 87Wife 134Sean Spicer 15 million   Mark Zohar (@markzohar) For those who missed it Spicer graced the lectern of the White House briefing room on Saturday to dispute the mainstream medias efforts to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the Mall during Trumps inaugurationMetal detectors slowed peoples arrival to the mall he said White floor coverings used for the first time highlighted empty spaces making it look as though fewer people had showed up And the reckless media put out a false narrative playing down how many came out to support TrumpHis key point No one had numbers because the National Park Service which controls the Mall does not put any outSpicer then goes on to list a few numbers that back up his assertion that Fridays crowd was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration period both in person and around the globe  That touched off a brief flurry to determine whether Spicer had spoken correctlyFor example crowd estimates can be fuzzy but Metro keeps count of every person who uses a Metro card to hop onto a train  and Spicer mentioned Metro numbers in his remarksAccording to Metro Fridays ridership was the lowest in at least two presidential inaugurationsAs  people took 570557 trips in the system between its early 4 am Friday opening through its midnight closingThe figures are significantly lower than those from the 2009 and 2013 inaugurations of President Barack Obama 11 million trips in 2009 and 782000 in 2013 according to MetroAnd The Posts Fact Checker gave Spicer Four Pinocchios adding  after examining his other

Sunday morning declaration that the White House had not issued a statement on the Womens March on Washington a day after the inauguration despite conflicting reportsHe also retweeted  the White House

Spicer tweeted and later he added this admonishment A reminder of the media danger of tweet first check facts laterA few minutes before the sun rose over Mar-a-Lago President Trump was up thumbing a series of tweets about Barack Obama and some of the darker days of 20th century American historyIn particular he was  just before the 2016 election  tactics Trump said hearkened to the McCarthy hearings and Red Scare of the late 1940s and 50sNothing found Trump tweeted This is McCarthyismTerrible Just found out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory Nothing found This is McCarthyism Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) McCarthyism is something of which Trump should have in-depth knowledgeHis lifelong attorney and mentor  Roy Cohn one of the men who helped mold Trump into Trump  was as one author called it Joseph McCarthys sidekick - whose lifelong mentor was Joseph McCarthys sidekick - complains of modern-day McCarthyism today West Wing Reports (@WestWingReport) After World War II McCarthy a Republican senator from Wisconsin  that large numbers of communist spies and sympathizers had infiltrated the US government and needed to be weeded outThe accusations happened during a period of escalating tensions with the Soviet Union and growing fears about the global spread of communism McCarthy interrogated alleged sympathizers at Senate hearings that came to bear his name Just an accusation could ruin reputations and careers  Cohn was the brains behind McCarthys rise to power and to many Americans one ofthe first real television personalities according to Mr Cohn with his slick hair dark complexion and heavy-lidded eyes the obit said was frequently seen whispering in the senators earEventually though Cohns influence in Washington waned as McCarthy and his hearings lost public supportDecades later after Cohn returned to New York he had Trumps earThey first met in New York in October 1973 when Trump was 27 and beginning to make his fortune in his familys real estate business Cohn then 46 was a high-profile defense lawyer with connections in city government and in the courtsHe used his connections to reward friends and punish opponentsaccording toThere were however legions of Cohn detractors He was a source of great evil in this society Victor A Kovner a Democratic activist in New York City and First Amendment lawyer told OHarrow and BoburgHe was a vicious Red-baiting source of sweeping wrongdoing  Cohn represented Trump and his dad Fred when they faced Justice Department allegations that they discriminated against black rental applicants atthe apartment complexes the family owned or managed according to OHarrow and BoburgOn Dec 12 1973 Cohn called a news conference saying they were suing the government for $100 million over the allegations In an affidavit Cohn said the government was trying to force subservience to the Welfare DepartmentThe Trumps ultimately settled the case with the government without admitting guilt  and declared victoryIn the late 70s and into the 1980s Cohn fought efforts to have him disbarred Through it all Trump was a loyal friend trophy client and protegeRoy had a whole crazy deal going but Roy was a really smart guy who liked me and did a great job for me on different things Trump told The Post according the story published in June And he was a tough lawyer and thats what I wanted Roy was a very tough guyMore than a year ago the Fact Checker  various claims that Donald Trump then a presidential candidate had made about Hillary Clintons alleged role in the approval of the sale of a Canadian company Uranium One with mining rights in the United States to Rosatom Russias nuclear energy agency Weve delved deep into the tale and recently  since Rep Devin Nunes head of the House Intelligence Committee announced thatCongress would launch a new probeHerewe are going to take a closer look at a key claim that the sale involved 20 percent of our uranium Look at how often Tucker Carlson brought up this line in a recent show saying it was insane for Clinton not to realize that a Russian company was getting 20 percent of our uranium supplySebastian Gorka a former Trump White House aide  that Clinton should be tried and potentially executed because the Russians infiltrated our national security to corner the uranium market and they succeededWe have noted repeatedly thatextracted uranium   whichRosatom does not have  but even so this 20 percent figure is especially misleading At the Fact Checker we a bit more preciselyas mining licenses for about 20 percent of US uranium extraction capacity But we were out of date it turns out20 percentis an especially stale numberThe original 20 percent figure  one of the agencies that approved the deal in 2010 It stated that as of 2010 the licenses represent approximately 20 percent of the currently licensed uranium in-situ recovery production capacity in the United StatesIn-situ recovery (ISR) is to obtain uranium from underground its the main method in the United States Its generally used for low-grade ore that would be otherwise too expensive to mine A solution is pumped into the ore deposit to dissolve the uranium The resulting liquid is then pumped back out driedso itbecomes yellowcakeandplaced in 55-gallon drumsbefore it is taken to a uranium conversion facility for eventual use in a nuclear power reactorButthe 20 percent number was a 2010 estimate that has now been overtaken by events such asadditional mining licenses being issued The Energy Information Administration has  and the Uranium One assets now represent much less than 20 percent production capacity because other US operations have been approvedThe NRC has licensed additional in-situ uranium facilities since the 20-percent figure was estimated (and it was an estimate) an NRC spokesman said in an email Our current estimate would be closer to 10 percentThe spokesman added Note also that even the original figure does not include conventional mines and was nowhere near saying they controlled 20 percent of US uranium reservesUranium One has  and may be looking to unload more an industry official said Thats because the US holdings were incidental to the Rosatom purchase of Uranium One it was more interested in the companys holdings in Kazakhstan the worlds leading uranium producerProduction capacity is one thing but the reality is actual production In fact so much Kazakh uranium is flooding the market that uranium prices have dropped and production in the United States has plummetedThe industry official said total US production in 2017 is expected to be less than 1000 tons  and production in 2016 was just 1126 tons By contrast Uranium Ones mines in Kazakhstan alone extracted nearly 3000 tons in 2016Uranium Ones US business has shrunk so quickly that it now represents a tiny part of US production In 2016 its Willow Creek facility extracted just 23 tons Thats 23 percent of all US production In 2015 the project represented 36 percent of US production and in 2014 113 percent In 2013 it was still 20 percent Two other Uranium One facilities currently are not being minedThis chart shows how Uranium Ones US production compares with total US production and how US production compares with worldwide production  Uranium production in the US is so small that I would rarely if ever use a statistic like that Its meaningless said  a nuclear expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey Twenty percent of bupkis is still bupkisA spokesman for Nunes did not respond to a request for commentThe 20 percent figure has long been in wide circulation As we noted the Fact Checker recently used it though with caveats But we should have looked at the actual production data and asked the NRC for an updated estimate of production capacity Clearly thenumber is woefully out of dateGiven that Uranium Ones production is only 2 percent of an already small total US production  not 20 percent  the overwrought claims that Clinton gave away 20 percent of the US nuclear supply or that Russia controls that much US uraniumare simply absurd()Do you rate this claim as true or false More Pinocchios for false fewer based on your opinion of the statements truthfulness (The check mark means you think the statement is true not that you agree with the rating)We need to verify that you are an actual person This is a non-scientific user poll Results are not statistically valid and cannot be assumed to reflect the views of Washington Post users as a group or the general populationWandering through Times Square past the Naked Cowboy and the Elmos and the ticket touts she could be any immigrant trying to live the American DreamA 60-year-old Korean woman with a soft perm and conservative clothes shes taking a weekend off from pressing shirts and hemming pants at the dry-cleaning business she runs with her husbandBut shes not just any immigrant Shes an aunt to Kim Jong Un the young North Korean leader who has  with a hydrogen bombAnd for the past 18 years since defecting from North Korea into the waiting arms of the CIA she has been living an anonymous life here in the United States with her husband and three children  My friends here tell me Im so lucky that I have everything Ko Yong Suk as she was known when she was part of North Koreas royal family told The Washington Post on a recent weekend My kids went to great schools and theyre successful and I have my husband who can fix anything Theres nothing we can envyHer husband previously known as Ri Gang chimes in with laughter I think we have achieved the American DreamThis is the story of how one family went from the top of North Korea to middle AmericaBreaking their silence in the United States Ko and Ri spent almost 20 hours talking to two Washington Post reporters in New York City and then at their home several hours drive away They were nervous about emerging from their anonymity after all there are Americans who analyze North Korea for a living and do not even know that the couple are hereThey asked The Post not to publish the names they use in the United States or to reveal where they live mainly to protect their grown children who live normal professional livesKo bears a striking resemblance to her sister Ko Yong Hui who was one of Kim Jong Ils wives and the mother of Kim Jong Un the third-generation leader of North Korea And she had a particularly close relationship with the man now considered one of the United States top enemies She took care of Kim Jong Un while he was at But in 1998 when Kim Jong Un was 14 and older brother Kim Jong Chol was 17 Ko and Ri decided to defect Kos sister their link to the regime was sick with terminal breast cancer  although she did not die until 2004  and the boys were getting older The couple apparently realized that they would not be needed by the regime much longer and fled concerned about losing their privileged statusThe Kim family has ruled North Korea for 70 years through a repressive system built on patronage and fear The royal family and top cadres in the Workers Party benefit from this system  and have the most to lose if it collapses or if they run afoul of the regimeSo the couple decided to flee  not to South Korea as many North Koreans do but to the United StatesThey have worked long hours running their dry-cleaning store and their three children have come of age here going to good colleges and getting good jobsThe family home is a large two-story house with two cars in the driveway a huge TV in the living room a grill on a rear deck Theyve been to Las Vegas on vacation and two years ago went to South Korea where Ko enjoyed visiting the palaces she had seen in TV dramasThey look like a normal familyBut look closer That photo of her eldest son on a jet-ski Its at Wonsan where the Kim family has its summer residence That girl in the photo album Its Kim Yo Jong  who runs the propaganda division of the Workers PartyAnd the house It was bought partly with a one-time payment of $200000 that the CIA gave the couple on their arrival they saidEven though Ko and Ri have not seen Kim Jong Un in almost 20 years and do not appear to have held official positions US intelligence on North Korea is so thin that this couple still represents a valuable source of information on the family courtThey can reveal for example that Kim Jong Un was born in 1984  not 1982 or 1983 as has been widely thought The reason theyre certain It was the same year that their first son was born He and my son were playmates from birth I changed both of their diapers Ko said with a laugh  Sometimes operatives from the CIAs national clandestine service come to town to show Ko and Ri photos of North Koreans and ask who the people areThe CIA declined to confirm or comment on any of Ko and Ris claims Some parts of the couples history can be verified but other parts cannot or seem incompleteEven today Ri in particular is sympathetic toward the North Korean regime and is trying to get approval to visit Pyongyang And both are careful in what they say about their  to whom they refer as Marshal Kim Jong UnBut what they will say about their former charge paints a picture of a man who was raised knowing that he would one day be king In 1992 Ko Yong Suk arrived in Bern Switzerland with Kim Jong Chol the first son of Kos sister and Kim Jong Il who in two years would become the leader of North Korea Kim Jong Un arrived in 1996 when he was 12We lived in a normal house and acted like a normal family I acted like their mother Ko said about her time in Bern I encouraged him to bring his friends home because we wanted them to live a normal life I made snacks for the kids They ate cake and played with LegosTraveling on a diplomatic passport Ri went back and forth between North Korea and Switzerland sometimes ferrying their youngest daughter and Kim Jong Uns younger sister back and forthThe family spoke Korean at home and ate Korean food but also enjoyed the benefits of an expatriate family in an exotic locale Ko took the Kim children to Euro Disney now Disneyland Paris Kim Jong Un had been to Tokyo Disneyland with his mother some years before  and her photo albums are full of pictures of them skiing in the Swiss Alps swimming on the French Riviera eating at al fresco restaurants in ItalyKim Jong Un loved games and machinery trying to figure out how ships float and planes fly He was already showing personality traits that would later become much more evidentHe wasnt a troublemaker but he was short-tempered and had a lack of tolerance Ko recalled When his mother tried to tell him off for playing with these things too much and not studying enough he wouldnt talk back but he would protest in other ways like going on a hunger strikeKim loved going home for the summer spending time in Wonsan where the family has a huge beachfront compound or at their main residence in Pyongyang with its movie theater and plenty of room to hang outHe started playing basketball and he became obsessed with it his aunt said of the young Kim who was a Michael Jordan fan and later hosted basketball player  several times in North Korea He used to sleep  with his basketballHe was shorter than his friends and his mother told him that if he played basketball he would become taller Ko saidLater at their house Ri produced a never-publicly seen photo laminated and stored in an envelope of a slightly built Kim aged 13 and his older brother among a team wearing basketball uniforms after a tournament in Pyongyang Ri is sitting in the front row while Ko is standing in the back Kim is holding a gold trophyThe world did not know that Kim had been anointed his fathers successor until October 2010 when his status was made official at a Workers Party conference in Pyongyang But Kim had known since 1992 that he would one day inherit North KoreaThe signal was sent at his eighth birthday party attended by North Koreas top brass the couple said Kim was given a generals uniform decorated with stars and real generals with real stars bowed to him and paid their respects to him from that moment onIt was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person when the people around him were treating him like that Ko saidFrom a humble background Ko was catapulted into the top echelons of North Korean society when her sister a performer caught the eye of the princeling Kim Jong Il and she became his third partner in 1975I was very close to my sister and it was a tough job to be the wife so she asked me to help her She could trust me because I was her own blood Ko saidKim Jong Il personally selected Ri to marry his sister-in-law They all lived in a compound in Pyongyang with Ko looking after her sisters and her own children for several years  We lived the good life Ko said Over a sushi lunch in New York she reminisced about drinking cognac with sparkling water and eating caviar in Pyongyang about riding with Kim Jong Il in his Mercedes-BenzThen came the charmed years in Europe But in 1998 Kos sister discovered she had breast cancer and underwent treatment in Switzerland and FranceThis is where Ko and Ris version of events starts to become opaque Given that Ri is trying to get back into Kim Jong Uns good graces he has reason to present their defection as nothing but altruisticThe way Ri and Ko tell it the cancer treatment in Europe was not working so they decided they should travel to the United States to try to secure treatment for Kos dying sister Their defection was all about trying to save Kim Jong Uns mother they sayStories about the couple in the South Korean news media have suggested that they sought asylum in the United States because they were concerned about what could happen to them after either of Kim Jong Uns parents died This was their link to the royal family and without that link what would happen to themWalking through Central Park on a Sunday morning Ko seemed to imply that this was a concernIn history you often see people close to a powerful leader getting into unintended trouble because of other people she said I thought it would be better if we stayed out of that kind of troubleThey had reason to be scared given Kos sisters position said Michael Madden editor of the  websiteKo Yong Hui was an ambitious woman  she wanted her sons to be promoted and she made enemies in the process Madden said If you were her sister or her brother-in-law you would feel threatened Someone could easily make you disappear Just look at the case of  the uncle who also lived in the Pyongyang compound with Ko and Ri He apparently built up too much power In 2013 Kim had him executedSo one day in 1998 Ri and Ko and their three children took a taxi to the US Embassy in Bern They said they were North Korean diplomats and wanted asylum After several days during which time a Korean speaker flew in from Washington they were taken to a US military base near FrankfurtThey stayed in a house on the base for several months while they were questioned Then Ri and Ko disclosed their family connectionsThe American government didnt know who Kim Jong Un was that he would become the leader Ri saidThe US government did not tell its ally South Korea that it had Ko and Ri until they were on American soil apparently infuriating the government in SeoulFor US intelligence agencies which struggle to get reliable information about the inner workings of the North Korean regime the defection must have seemed like hitting the intelligence jackpotBut Ri insists they did not know much They thought we must know some secrets but we didnt know anything he said We were just looking after the children and helping them study so of course we saw a lot of their private lives but we had nothing to do with defense We didnt know any nuclear or military secretsMadden said the pair would have had limited intelligence value Alexandre Mansourov a North Korean leadership expert who once studied at Kim Il Sung University in Pyongyang agreedYes they understand the system very well he said However they missed the famine and the recovery the transition to the new leadership and all the events of the last five years In that sense theyre living in the past When they landed in the United States the family spent a few days in the Washington area  not far from the CIA  before moving to a small city where a South Korean church had offered to help them as it did for others who escaped the NorthThe people at the church kept asking us questions They knew we were from North Korea but they told us we didnt look like North Koreans They kept asking us questions Ko saidSo the family moved to a different city with very few other Koreans or even other AsiansLife was hard at the beginning We had no relatives and we were working for 12 hours every day Ri said He worked as a builder then did maintenance in an apartment house jobs that were easy to do without EnglishKo was frustrated at not being able to work and contribute The only thing I could do without speaking the language was dry cleaning she said in Korean Ri speaks reasonable English today but Kos is still basicSo they opened a small store and began working long hours Ri at the machines and Ko doing alterations They soon hit their stride Seeing my kids doing well in school and my husband working so hard gave me the strength and energy to carry on Ko saidTheir children have no interest in Korea North or South she said   They have a comfortable existence but certainly do not appear to be living large Stopping at a gas station for lunch on the way back to their home Ko remarked that bottled water was very cheap and was disappointed that the Dunkin Donuts was out of burritos So why are they breaking their silence nowRi says he wants to visit North Korea and has come out of their deep cover to dispel what he calls lies being peddled about them and their family in North Korea by regime critics in South KoreaLast year Ri and Ko moved to sue three high-level North Korean defectors who had been on South Korean television accusing them of a variety of activities including having plastic surgery and stealing millions of dollars from the Kim regime The couple hired a celebrity lawyer Kang Yong-seok to pursue a defamation case but it was thrown out on a technicality Kang arranged for The Washington Post to meet the couple and was present for most of the interviews in New YorkEven after the years the couple has spent in the United States North Korea still has some pullRi who is particularly careful around reporters not to speak ill of the regime is positioning himself as the person to bridge the widening gap between Washington and PyongyangMy ultimate goal is to go back to North Korea I understand America and I understand North Korea so I think I can be a negotiator between the two he said If Kim Jong Un is how I remembered he used to be I would be able to meet him and talk to himMansourov described Ris hopes to return to North Korea as ridiculousHe has a nice life in the US Why would he want to go back Unless hes ready to go upstairs  he saidKo said she misses her home town  the pull of the home town cannot be underestimated in Korean culture  but does not want to go back Nor does she want Ri to visit But how can I change my stubborn husbands mindLuckily for Ko that decision is Kim Jong Uns And hes not showing any interest in having an intermediary anytime soon to help him improve relations with the United States Yoonjung Seo contributed to this reportSEOUL - The South Korean political system has been shaken to its core over the revelations that  from Choi Soon-sil a friend of 40 years who held no official position and had no policy backgroundThe saga began with a simple and apparently self-contained incident The chief executive of Nature Republic a South Korean cosmetics company was arrested for gambling in Macau in November 2015Gambling is illegal for South Koreans and is punishable with prison time even if the South Korean citizen is caught gambling abroadChung Woon-ho the executive was found guilty and sentenced to a year in prisonDuring the appeal process Chung had a legal dispute with his attorney In the process of probing this dispute a typically South Korean act of corruption was uncovered involving a prosecutor a businessman and a government officialBut this time it was really serious involving the former chief of the prosecutors office a high-ranking judge the conglomerate Lotte and a senior secretary to the presidentThe investigation uncovered the existence of Lotte slush funds and ended with the suicide of Lottes vice chairman who left a note taking full responsibility The former chief of the prosecutors office and the judge were arrestedHowever the senior secretary to the president and a former senior prosecutor Woo Byung-woo walked away unscathedEight months later South Koreas biggest newspaper the  broke news of another scandal involving a business a prosecutor and a government official A familiar name surfaced again Woo Byung-wooThe Chosun Ilbo reported that an Internet game company Nexon did a favor for Woo by buying his familys land for $120 millionat a time that they were having a trouble selling it The allegation was that the land had been bought in return for Woo turning a blind eye on a prosecutors unlawful gains from Nexon sharesWoo had been in charge of vetting this prosecutor for promotion in 2015The nation was incensed by this allegationof systemic corruption in the justice system The fact that Woo was not investigated only increased suspicion that it was he who held the real power inside the presidential office enough to influence the national justice system Local media began calling him an emperorThen a further Chosun Ilbo investigation led to yet another government official being exposed for abusing his power This time it was another senior secretary to the president An Chong-bumAn had allegedly been strong-arming conglomerates to donate money to the newly established MI-R FoundationAn had reportedly used the threat of painful audits to extort money from as many as 30 conglomerates Local media reported that it was suspected that An had been raising money that was to be for Parks personal use after she retires in 2018 The former head of the MI-R Foundation later said in an interview with the Chosun Ilbo that he was told Woo at the presidential office and the prosecutors office had their backJust as the Chosun Ilbos focus was moving ever closer to the president herself one of the lawmakers in Parks ruling managed to deflect attention away from this embarrassing probe and back on to the newspaper byhighlighting the fact that the Chosun Ilbos chief writer had received expensive trips from Daewoo a shipping company in 2011The incident significantly damaged the papers reputation and it suspended its reporting on the relationship betweenthe foundation and the presidential officeThen another local newspaper the left-leaning Hankyoreh brought the story back to life with asurprising twistItpublished a story that named Choi Soon-sil as the de-factoowner of the MI-R Foundation Choi had been friends with Park since the 1970s and was the daughter of Choi Tae-min a cult founder who was believed to have had huge influence over Park until his death in 1994Park Geun-hye and Choi Tae-mins strange relationship was an open secret in South Korea but had never been investigatedAs the investigation rolled on suspicion grew concerning Choi Soon-sils undue influence 14 shell companies were linked to her in Germany then a friend claimed that Chois favorite hobby was changing Park Geun-hyes speechesPark initially dismissed the allegations as mere rumors but when a cable channel reported on Oct 24 that the presidents speeches had been found on Choi Soon-sils tablet computer such denials were no longer plausibleThe president has since made  but these have not beenenough to assuage the publics growing anger and tens of thousands ofcitizens have taken to the streets over the past twoweeks calling for her resignationParks approval rating has plummeted to 5 percent according to Gallup Korea the lowest for a president in the polls historyThe investigation isonly just beginning but already Parks senior secretary An Chong-bum and Choi Soon-sil have been arrested for abuse of power and attempted fraud and corporate officials from conglomerates including Samsung are being questioned by prosecutorsEmperor Woo Byung-woo was also summoned for questioning Sunday As the senior secretary to the president for civil affairs Woos role is to monitor corruption of the people close to the president How he will come out of this scandal remains to be seenNo one knows where the chips may fall in this ongoing saga but this much is clear What began with one businessman playing cards at a table in Macau has now grown into since its democratization in 1987In the most abstract sense there is nothing noteworthy about a government official meeting with an ambassador from a foreign country When such an interaction becomes important is when that official is an ally of a presidential campaign thats got a complex set of possibly inappropriate relationships with other representatives of that ambassadors country  and when that official whileunder oathsays he did not have communications with representatives of that countryWhat were going to endeavor to do here is to parse out that complex set of relationships using the information we have at hand In this case as youve hopefully ascertained the country at issue is Russia and the campaign is that of President Trump The official of course is  And the ambassador is at this point the linchpin of a lot of the interactions between Trump and the rest of his teamWell consider three Russian entitiesAs for the American side lets start at the top and move outward through Trumps network Trumps connections to Russian business interests are murky thanks to his decision not to release his tax returns during the campaign We know that the Miss Universe pageant was hosted in Moscow when Trump owned it and that he  millions of dollars for doing so We know too that hes repeatedly explored real estate deals in the country Its not clear whether Trump has met Kislyak though the ambassador  a foreign policy speech Trump gave last spring and the reception that preceded it We know now that Trump has been in communication with Putin  but he also claimed to have been in contact with representatives of the Russian president (and Putin himself)    Sessionss relationship with Kislyak is well-established by now This is a good point at which to note though that the existence of that relationship does not in any way imply wrongdoing by Sessions Its just part of the network were establishing Trumps son-in-law (Ivankas husband) also met with Kislyak during the period between Election Day and the inauguration according to  Kushner also has some loose connections to Russian business interests according to the  including an investment from tech investor Yuri Milner in a real estate investment company and a friendship with the wife of oligarch Roman Abramovich (She was  to the inauguration as Ivanka Trumps guest) Flynn had a number of contacts with Kislyak after Election Day including attending that meeting between the ambassador and Kushner (Flynn was forced to resign his position after  that his comments about the content of those meetings to Vice President Pence were falsehoods) After resigning from the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 Flynn was invited to give a paid speech at a celebration of RT He did so and joined Putins table for a related banquet The younger Trump visited France last October to  to an obscure Russian group In 2008 Don Jr who works for the Trump Organization  told a real estate conference that Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets and that we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia Manaforts links to Russian interests are  New revelations that emerged during the campaign prompted Trump to demand Manaforts resignation Manafort is one of the Trump campaign staffers who  made contact with Russian interests during the campaign Before he was confirmed to serve as the head of the State Department even Republicans  Tillersons relationship to Putin As the head of ExxonMobil Tillerson helped negotiate a massive agreement between the Russian government and  a partnership between the two companies Tillerson was subsequently  the Order of Friendship by PutinBeing a friend of Vladimir is not an attribute I am hoping for from a   MR Marco Rubio (@marcorubio)  Rosss connections to Russian business interests are less obvious than Tillersons During the Clinton administration Ross served on the board of the  an effort to bolster businesses in post-Cold-War Russia During his confirmation questions arose about his ownership of a bank on Cyprus that in the words of  caters to wealthy Russians Stones connection to Russia is murky During the campaign he drew attention for seeming to have inside knowledge on the   releases that have been linked to Russian interests by the government More directly the Times  that Stone is possibly under investigation by the US government for his links to Russia Page is included in that alleged investigation as well but his links to Russia are more clear Page pretty clearly met with Kislyak last year during the Republican convention in Cleveland as he  to MSNBCs Chris Hayes on Thursday night He also has repeatedly  Russian business groups in that country including twice in 2016 Over a decade ago he worked in Russia as an investment banker Page is far in the outer orbit of Trumps circle serving briefly as part of Trumps national security advisory team Hes joined there by Gordon a onetime Pentagon spokesman who also served as an adviser to the campaign Gordon like Page  spoke with Kislyak in ClevelandThis document should be considered a work in progress As more information is released it (and the graphic) will be updated Again none of the relationships above are intended to show misbehavior by those involved The broad question at stake is the extent to which Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 election and if it did the extent to which it may have leveraged relationships with Trumps team to that end That much-bigger question is much harder to evaluateWhen President Trump took the oath of office his administration  on the  website replacing former president Barack Obamas policy goals with new prioritiesBut at least one page remains  that allows the people to call on the White House to take action on the issue that matters to youAnd the people apparently want to see Trumps tax returns created Friday asks the administration to immediately release Donald Trumps full tax returns and says it wants Trump to not be in conflict with the Emoluments Clause of the ConstitutionThe unprecedented economic conflicts of this administration need to be visible to the American people including any pertinent documentation which can reveal the foreign influences and financial interests which may put Donald Trump in conflict with the emoluments clause of the Constitution the petition says  Less than a day after the petition was created it eclipsed the   enough to elicit an official response from the White House at least according to the Obama-era promise that remains on the petitions pageKellyanne Conway a senior adviser to Trump issued a response on national television Sunday morningThe White House response is that hes not going to release his tax returns she told George Stephanopoulos on ABCs This Week We litigated this all through the election People didnt care they voted for him And let me make this very clear most Americans are very concerned with what their tax returns will look like while President Trump is in office not what his look likeAs  A Post-ABC poll last week showed that Trumps continued refusal to release his tax returns continues to be an unpopular decision with 74 percent of Americans saying he should make the documents public including 53 percent of RepublicansPresidents Wagner noted are not required to release their tax returns but presidents dating back to Richard Nixon have routinely done so voluntarilyThere were a handful of other petitions created during inauguration weekendalso focuses on Trumps money demanding he divest or put in a blind trust all of the Presidents business and financial assets One asked Trump to  Another sought the repeal of the  removing restrictions on gun ownership  Oh and some people But by far the most popular petition was the one demanding Trumps tax returns As of Monday morning it had been signed by more than 250000 peopleIt seeks documentation about foreign influences and financial interests that could put Trump in conflict with the Emoluments ClauseThe little-known constitutional provision prohibits a president from accepting a gift or a benefit from a foreign leader It was drafted by the Founding Fathers to prevent the leaders of the fledgling United States from being under the financial thumb of a foreign country like France or EnglandBut Trumps critics say the billionaire businessman was violating the Constitution the moment he swore an oath to protect and defend itRon Fein the legal director at Free Speech for People  that there are several examples of Trump violating the Emoluments Clause including rent paid by the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China for its space in Trump Tower in New York and spending by foreign diplomats at the Trump properties including his hotel in Washington a few blocks from his new home  Sunday night  that a liberal watchdog group says it plans to file a lawsuit against President Trump in federal court on Monday alleging that he is in violation of the Emoluments ClauseTrump has claimed he would donate profits from foreign business clients to the US Treasury although he hasnt said exactly how hed track collect and disburse such payments according to GoldAnd even if hes found to be in violation of the Emoluments Clause it is unclear whether a violation of it qualifies as treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors that could lead to Trumps impeachmentTrumps refusal to release his tax returns became a heated issue on the campaign trailOn Jan 11 during Trumps first official news conference since winning the election he continued to resist suggestions to release the returnsThe only ones that care about my tax returns are the reporters Trump said You learn very little from a tax returnTrump also pointed to an ongoing audit as the reason he couldnt release his tax returnsIm not releasing the tax returns because as you know theyre under audit he saidSenior White House counselor Kellyanne Conway this week to only one of President Trumps executive orders  namely his temporary ban on refugees and travel from seven Muslim-majority countries  and not enough to the many others Trump has signed since taking officeSo Seth Meyers did just thatOn Tuesdays Late Night With Seth Meyers the comedian used a segment called The Check In to delve into a less-discussed executive order specifically one with a few exceptionsThe order arguably  been covered less than Trumps travel ban possibly in part because it has not triggered numerous protests and lawsuits nor does its fate rest with Nevertheless Meyers persistedThe stated that no vacant positions existing at noon on January 22 2017 may be filled and no new positions may be created except in limited circumstances Military personnel and other positions deemed necessary to meet national security or public safety responsibilities were exemptedIn his segment Tuesday Meyers pointed out that the hiring freeze seemed to run counter to one of Trumps most frequent campaign promises that he can fix the problems with how poorly the Department of Veterans Affairs was run  And hes right about that For many years now under both Bush and Obama many parts of the VA have been found guilty of fraud and of providing shoddy health care to our veterans Meyers said Now one of the main problems at the VA is that many departments including VA hospitals are chronically understaffed But one of Trumps first moves as president was to put a freeze on federal hiringMeyers cut to footage of White House press secretary Sean Spicer saying that the focus on VA staffing was overblown and that hiring more people was not the answerHiring more people is not the answer Meyers said sarcastically Unless the question is Where are all the (expletive) people Does anyone work here Meyers also noted that the hiring freeze had the potential to hurtveterans in another way since they receive a preference in federal hiringAs on the day the executive action was signedVeterans  who make up 31percent of the federal workforce  could also be disproportionately affected by the move because they receive a hiring preference when it comes to federal jobs One unit of the Pentagon according to an official who asked for anonymity to discuss personnel matters is in the process of hiring between 20 and 30 veterans and is now looking at whether to put the hires on holdDepending on how the exemptions are interpreted according to New York University public service professor Paul Light the freeze might affect fewer than 800000 employees or more than one-fifth of the overall federal workforceA lot of the people affected by this freeze are people who served this country people for whom Trump promised to fight Meyers said And instead hes making it harder for them to assimilate back to civilian life by in some cases taking away their ability to work  In the rest of the segment Meyers summarized Trumps complicated history with veterans issues He opened by cycling through a handful of clips of Trump talking about veterans throughout his campaignThe vets Oh those vets I love those vets Were going to take care of those vetsIve worked hard for the vetsTheres nobody bigger or better at the military than I amMeyers did credit Trump for  to help build a Vietnam veterans memorial in New York City But Meyers also reminded viewers that  cutting to another clip in which Trump explained I had a foot thingDuring his transition Trump was criticized for his lack of outreach to veterans groups Meyersmentioned a December post fromveterans advocate Paul Rieckhoff who was frustrated at the time that the president-elect had managed to fit rapper Kanye West into his schedulebut no major veterans groupsWow Time for Kanye But still a month after the election and no time for a single leader from a national veterans service organization  Paul (PJ) Rieckhoff (@PaulRieckhoff) Meyers brought his Tuesday segment full circle by commenting on Trumps numerousexecutive orders in generalThis whole thing is just another example of Trump signing these executive orders in haste without thinking about the consequences and in turn leaving a trail of chaos Meyers said You know at first I thought he was just showing off his signature but now I think hes going Hey could someone read this to me I feel like it might be a terrible ideaThe World Health Organization announced its first list of antibiotic-resistant priority pathogens on Monday detailing 12 families of bacteria that agency experts say pose the greatest threat to human health and kill millions of people every yearThe list is divided into three categories prioritized by the urgency of the need for new antibiotics The purpose is to guide and promote research and development of new drugs officials saidMost of the pathogens are among the nearly two dozen antibiotic-resistant microbes that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned in a could cause potentially catastrophic consequences if the United States didnt act quickly to combat the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant infectionsThis list is not meant to scare people about new superbugs said Marie-Paule Kieny an assistant director-general at WHO Its intended to signal research and development priorities to address urgent public health threats  Superbugs that the WHO considers the highest priority are responsible for severe infections and high mortality rates especially among hospitalized patients in intensive care or using ventilators and blood catheters as well as among transplant recipients and people undergoing chemotherapy While these pathogens are not widespread the burden for society is now alarming she saidIncluded in this highest-priority group is CREor carbapenem-resistant  which US health officials have dubbed  In some instances it kills up to 50 percent of patients who become infected An elderly Nevada woman who died last year contracted an infection caused by CRE that was resistant to allavailable in the United StatesAlso in the first-tier group is the infections tied to it typically occur in ICUs and settings with very sick patients The other bacteria tagged as a critical prioritywhich can be spread on the hands of health-care workers or by equipment that gets contaminated and is not properly cleanedWHOs list follows that world leaders held last fall  only the fourth time they had addressed a health issue at the UN General Assembly  The lists second and third tiers  the high and medium priority categories  cover bacteria that cause more common diseases such as  and food poisoning caused by salmonella While not associated with significant mortality rates they have a dramatic health and economic impact particularly in low-income countries Kieny saidAlthough there has been renewed interest and in antibiotics because of the growing threat that antibiotic resistance poses much of the work is more focused on antibiotics with a broad range she saidWe have to focus specifically for a much smaller range of bacteria targeting the three highest-priority pathogens Kieny saidDrug companies have also tended to focus more on Gram-positive bacteria that tend to colonize the skin of healthy individuals and generate less resistance said Evelina Tacconelli who heads the infectious diseases division at the University of Tbingen in Germany which helped develop the WHO list By comparison Gram-negative bacteria more frequently colonize intestinal reservoirs and can cause sepsis and severe urinary tract infections especially among elderly patients  There have been no new classes of antibiotics discovered that have made it to market since 1984 according to the Pew Charitable Trusts antibiotic-resistance project And there arent enough drugs to meet future needs Allan Coukell senior director of health programs at Pew said MondayOf the 40 antibiotics in clinical development in the United States fewer than half even have the potential to treat the pathogens identified by WHO he said And based on history most of those will fail to reach the clinic for reasons of efficacy or safety So the outlook is grimHistorical data show that generally only one of five drugs that reach the initial phase of testing in humans will receive approval from the Food and Drug AdministrationDeveloping antibiotics to treat highly resistant bacterial infections is especially challenging because only a small number of patients contract these infections and meet the requirements to participate in traditional clinical trialsPublic health experts welcomed the announcement including the need to address the problem in a comprehensive fashionWhile research and development are essential we cannot just discover and develop our way out of this crisis said Helen Boucher an infectious diseases doctor at Tufts University and a spokeswoman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America Prevention the appropriate use of antibiotics and surveillance are all necessary as part of a coordinated approach she saidIn the United States antibiotic-resistant infections kill an estimated 23000 Americans each year according to the CDC Global estimates are difficult because there is no uniform way to include antimicrobial resistance in causes of death But experts say that drug-resistant infections especially those caused by the WHOs highest-priority pathogens double or triple the risk of deathWe are talking about millions of people affected Tacconelli saidTuberculosis whose resistance has been growing in recent years was not included in the list because it is targeted by other dedicated programs WHO saidHere is the list from WHO1 carbapenem-resistant 2  carbapenem-resistant 3  carbapenem-resistant ESBL-producing4 vancomycin-resistant 5 methicillin-resistant vancomycin-intermediate and resistant 6 clarithromycin-resistant 7 spp fluoroquinolone-resistant 8 Salmonellae fluoroquinolone-resistant 9 cephalosporin-resistant fluoroquinolone-resistant10 penicillin-non-susceptible 11 ampicillin-resistant 12 spp fluoroquinolone-resistantunnecessaryOn Jan 7 North Koreas state media shocked the international community by announcing the  of a hydrogen bomb test Many international observers in South Korea and the West  whether North Koreas nuclear test was actually a hydrogen bomb like Kim Jong Un alleged or  similar to what it had tested previously Then on Feb 7 North Korea launched a long-range missile that put a satellite into orbit seen as a demonstration that the country had ballistic missiles that can aim those weapons at the WestNorth Korea has clearly tested another nuclear device bringing not just from Western countries but more alarmingly for Pyongyang from its traditional allies Russia and ChinaWhy would North Korea risk steepened international sanctions at a time when its economy has been ravaged by the worst drought in a centuryHeres why To strengthen Kim Jong Uns totalitarian grip on power at a time when the regime has been losing its ability to reward loyal elites with revenues derived from  and has resorted to violent purges to punish That makes sense when you consider these five factorsKims father Kim Jong-Il took power relatively easily in 1994 Thats because he had been heir-apparent as early as 1980 gradually gaining authority over the North Korean military But Kims takeover in December 2011 was relatively sudden because he was  only one year before his fathers death As a result the new Dear Leader had very little time to establish his credibility among the ruling elites before taking powerAnonymous accounts from Pyongyang elites recently revealed that many believed Kim has an  born out of a lifetime of privilege and shouldnt be leader within the North Korean military-industrial complex are battling over whether Kims military investments and China policy are the right strategies Some are challenging Kims authority so severely that the regime has begun  But thats a short-term Band-Aid not a long-term strategyUsing nuclear weapons to rally the country has a history In 1962 the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK)  hyper-militarization and nuclear weapons development that would enable the country to defend itself from any US and South Korean aggression without help from the Soviets or Chinese Since Kim Il Sung launched North Koreas nuclear program in the 1980s North Korean elites have believed that a  boosts the nations international statusThats true not because it demonstrates military might Nuclear tests bring international media attention which boosts North Korean pride Scott Snyder and Kyung Ae-Park argue in their 2013 book  that North Korean aggression brings the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK) welcome geopolitical recognitionWhen the United States sends former presidents to engage in diplomatic negotiations with the DPRK regime thats a massive PR victory and boosts Kims status and power State-level diplomatic recognition also contributes greatly to the legitimization of North Korea Leaders like  argue for a North Korean seat at the bargaining table on nuclear security issues which strengthens Kim reassuring elites that the nation is not entirely isolated internationallySuccessfully testing a hydrogen bomb strengthens Kims claim to know what hes doing as he invests the nations scarce resources in developing nuclear technology It proves that he can lead Whats more it gives Kim heightened stature as a patriotic hero since neither his father nor his grandfather was able to build and test a hydrogen bombNo one believed North Koreas official announcement that with the newly tested hydrogen bomb the DPRK could now And yet the announcement reinforced Kims deeper message The UnitedStates remains a hostile power encircling North Korea and nuclear weapons are essential to combat that threatNothing brings a group together like a big bad enemy and thats exactly what  does Consolidate elite and popular backing for the regime Thats why the regime has for decades fed the public educational propaganda and state-run news media reports to remind citizens of the  proof that America is an ever-threatening enemyThat anti-Americanism runs deep at all levels of society Its part of why even the more independent-thinking elites accept Kims  with the West even if that might end sanctions relieve starvation and poverty and bring more international aid Kim reminds them that after Libyan dictator  renounced weapons of mass destruction the West backed the colonels overthrow  and the nation has been in chaos sinceNorth Korea may depend on China to keep from starving  and yet it has recently been extremely belligerent toward its patron as if Kim is proving that money cant buy obedience The DPRKs recent  include  the January hydrogen bomb test and the February rocket launchLee Jung Hoon a noted professor of international relations at Seouls Yonsei University contends that China views Kim as an  Kim has  North Korea wants to make clear that its an independent ally not its patrons proxy or puppetBut China is stuck It doesnt want  putting almost 25 million starving refugees at its border Thats why it keeps pledging and delivering assistance And North Korea exploits that quite effectively realizing that China has no choice but to support it no matter what In other words the China-North Korea partnership is a  not a genuine allianceBut why would North Korea launch a nuclear test and satellite nowMany regional observers believe its because in May Pyongyang will hold a historic  the first gathering of ruling party members since 1980  that Kim called a Workers Party Congress because he wants to formalize authority and power structures Even though Kim retains totalitarian control over the North Korean state challenges from dissident factions have caused him to reinforce his legitimacy through established political institutionsLee Cheol-woo a member of South Koreas parliamentary intelligence committee recently argued that North Koreas hydrogen bomb test was aimed at  that Kim could celebrate at the Congress rallying the elites so that they will back him as he consolidates powerHeres what all this means Unfortunately North Koreas recent hydrogen bomb and missile tests are not irrational actions by a rogue dictatorship Rather they are strategic moves aimed at consolidating Kims leadership position domestically Belligerence fuels pro-regime nationalism boosting Kims status so that he can tighten his grip on power Thats why hes willing to antagonize long-time allies and suffer through still more international sanctionsAll of which means that North Korean aggression will continue to be one of the most intractable security problems in the Asia-Pacific regionNorth Korea is touting technological progress in its nuclear program saying after a nuclear test Friday that it can now produce smaller lighter and diversified nuclear warheads of higher strike power But it is also making strides in its missile program analysts say  advances that could enable it to outsmart missile defense systems which could make the missiles more attractive to potential customersNorth Korea conducted what it called a nuclear warhead explosion test Friday The country has conducted only five nuclear tests since its program began but this is the third since Kim Jong Un took power at the end of 2011 and its second this year  Under Kims leadership North Korea has also sharply accelerated the pace of missile testing with almost two dozen launches this year alone While many of this years tests have not been successful and there are still many unknowns about North Koreas nuclear and missile programs there have still been noticeable  and concerning  improvementsIt seems like North Korea is trying to qualitatively improve its missiles and develop options to evade or fool US missile defenses said  director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association If this continues unchecked they could develop an intercontinental ballistic missile that could pose a threat to the United States in the next decadeIn  North Korea launched three medium-range missiles Monday as China which had joined the international condemnation of last months submarine-launched ballistic missile was hosting the Group of 20 summit in HangzhouThe rockets flew about 600 miles  putting Hangzhou within range But they were sent in the other direction falling inside Japans air defense identification zoneArms control experts have since been poring over photos of the launches released by the North Korean media  shows three missiles being launched in the space of a minute from trucks parked on a highway south of Pyongyang  The location is within the security belt protecting Kim and the other regime elites in the capital said Michael Madden editor of the  website That meant the drills could be simulating the collapse of the state or the presence of hostile forces within the country he said  by  on    But it was the modifications to the missile that surprised the rocket scientists at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey Calif It appears that North Korea has extended the distance a short-range Scud can fly making it halfway between a Scud and a medium-range missile which the North Koreans call the Rodong That means that a longer-range missile could be wheeled out on an existing Scud transporter  obviating the need to produce new trucks Syria is among the countries thought to have bought short-range Scuds from North Korea in about 2000This is a really nice upgrade said  director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program in Monterey Countries looking to buy North Korean missiles are probably looking at this and thinking Ooooh thats niceNorth Korea has been concentrating on developing road-mobile missiles that can be fueled in a shelter or tunnel instead of on a traditional launchpad that can be detected by satellites  and theoretically invite a preemptive strikeJapans self-defense forces did not detect Mondays launch in advance the Nikkei newspaper reported It said this underscored the limits of Japans traditional defense capability programIn the past when activity was seen around the launchpad Japans self-defense forces would roll out Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) interceptors at the Defense Ministry headquarters in Tokyo But road-mobile missiles can be readied for launch in a matter of minutes cutting the time available to respondJapan is very concerned that North Korea has launched so many different missiles in such a short period said Atsuya Tanimoto of the Japanese Defense Ministrys intelligence analysis office North Korea is improving its technology he said(Korean Central Television)North Korea also appears to be looking for other ways to avoid interception no doubt motivated by South Koreas recent decision to host a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) antimissile unit for the US military The battery is due to be deployed to a site south of Seoul next yearBut by firing the three missiles within the space of a minute rather than over the usual course of an hour or so North Korea appeared to be testing a way to make it more difficult to intercept incoming missiles said  chief analytics officer at AllSource Analysis a Colorado-based consultant groupThis launch was probably designed to test not only operational readiness but to develop tricks to defeat antimissile defenses in Japan and South Korea Bermudez said When you launch in a barrage at the same time it complicates missile defense So theyve shown they have not just the technological capability but the operational capability for simultaneous launchesFurthermore it appeared that the missile tested Monday separates after launch  making it harder for missile defense systems to interceptWhen a solid warhead remains attached to the missile its easier to hit because its a bigger target Lewis said If you were in Egypt staring at Israel you might really like a warhead like thisNorth Korea has not demonstrated any capacity to make a nuclear warhead small enough to attach to a missile let alone the ability to deliver a nuclear-tipped missile to a targetStill the progress in its medium-range missile program follows observable advances in North Koreas quest to launch missiles from sea as well as from land  North Korea was ridiculed for apparently Photoshopping a ballistic missile launch from a submarine in May But last month it successfully launched a missile from a submarine near its east coast port of Sinpo It flew about 300 miles toward Japan before falling into the seaThis showed that its missile program might be progressing faster than originally expected said John Schilling an aerospace engineer who studies North Koreas missilesHowever this does not mean it will be ready next week next month or even next year he  for the 38 North websiteBut North Koreas submarine-launched ballistic missiles could be operational by the second half of 2018 he wroteConcurrent with making progress on its delivery systems North Korea has also been refurbishing its old missile production infrastructureKim has toured the January 18 General Machinery Plant which makes sensitive missile components several times over the past year During one visit he joked that it looked so good that visitors might think they were in a resort  International sanctions imposed through the United Nations as well as direct sanctions from the United States South Korea and Japan have been designed to cut off North Koreas ability to buy parts for its nuclear and missile programs as well as stanch financial flowsBut the steady rat-a-tat of missile tests suggests that North Korea has plenty of missile parts to play withSome American officials suggest that North Korea might be racing against the clock trying to test and make as much progress as it can before the latest round of sanctions really bitesWhile Bermudez warned against getting too excited about the most recent developments saying they simply reinforce what had been seen previously Lewis said the developments should disabuse anyone of the notion that North Korea was not serious about its missile programTheyre testing at a really fast rate because the program is real he said The idea that this is a Potemkin missile program is just nonsenseFake news identity theft

political news and stories about the candidatesFor some it serves obvious political aims But others have made thousands hawking bogus stories to people seen as both gullible and hyperpartisanAs The Washington Posts  There are a lot of variables that factor into exactly how much a viral hoax story can make for its creator But if you take Facebook shares as an indirect indicator of how widely viewed some of these sites might be you start to understand why if optimized properly fake-news sites targeting hyperpartisan audiences can be lucrativeOne prolific fake news writer  that he makes $10000 a month from Googles Adsense A 23-year-old recent graduate from Davidson College  that he churned out fake news from his home office in Maryland  and made about $1000 an hourFacebook and to a lesser extent Twitter are a big part of the fake news business model according to Alexios Mantzarlis who headsPoynters International Fact-Checking Network  A person with a viewpoint and a personality  even a fake one  isa better driver of traffic to a page than the publications brand account Mantzarlis said No one really knows these websites as their own things This is stuff that primarily shows up on news feedsMantzarlis said fake news website are often built to churn out stories as quickly as possible which can lead to troubling mistakesIm not surprised Ive seen the stock pictures used and taken all the time  This isnt rocket science Mantzarlis told The Washington Post Fake news sites create content as fast as they can to get as much money as they can They dont do as much research or any research for their stories so they wouldnt do a lot of research when creating these Facebook personalitiesThe ethics of fake news aside Randazza said hes amazed that no one at the company thought using Hunters name and face could end in legal troubleAt least in a lot of the cases that I get involved in you can at least look at it and understand the logic behind some of the poor decisions he

reduce allied commitments and support and create significant opportunities for our enemies to seize the initiativeA number of lawmakers said it is time to update the law to be more consistent with current conditions and threats Sen Tim Kaine (D-Va) and Sen Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) are co-sponsoring a proposal providing new legal authority to combat al-Qaeda the Taliban and the Islamic StateThis is one of the most important topics the United States Senate and this committee could ever consider Under what circumstances and legal authorities should the United States send our men and women into war said Sen Benjamin L Cardin (Md) the top Democrat on the committeeFlake noted that not a single member of the committee was in the Senate when the original war authorizations were signed by President George W Bush more than a decade agoCongress needs to weigh in he said We have to make sure our adversaries and our allies and most importantly our troops know that we speak with one voiceShortly before Tillerson and Mattis started testifying a small group of protesters in the room chanted Stop endless war before they were evictedThis has been a 16-year struggle said Sen Ron Johnson (R-Wis) I dont think its going to be over any time soonin the eastern United States this weekend but that wont stop the clocks from springing forward an hour with the return of daylight saving timeAt 2 am Sunday (March 12) the clocks move ahead one hour and we leave standard time behind While the time shift costs us an hour of sleep evenings will be noticeably brighter again reminding us that the long bright days of spring are just around the cornerAfterthe time switch the sun will set around 7 pm or later in most parts of the countryFor manythe later sunset means no more commuting home in the dark and enough daylight for a round of golf or an evening runin the parkHere in Washington DC sunset will shift from 611 pm to 712 pm after DST begins on SundayCities straddling the western edge of time zones will enjoythe latest sunsets for example Atlanta or Indianapolis but theyll also have to contend with especially dark mornings these next few weeks In Indianapolis Sundays sunrise isnt until 8 amOne of the biggest arguments against daylight saving time besides  is the reduction in morning light after moving the clocks ahead Some argue that DST  since they have to go to school in the darkWhile its true that daylight saving time steals light from the morning many people forget that the sun will continue to rise earlier for the nextthree months The arrival of spring means daylight is now increasing at its most rapid pace of the year which means that by mid-April sunrise will have caught up to where it was before DST beginsIn Washington DC sunrise shifts from 625 am to 723 am after we spring forward By April 19 sunrise will again be at 625 am as shown in the chart belowThe highera cityslatitude the more quickly sunrise catches up tothe same time as it occurredbefore DST began Interestingly the dark mornings that result from daylight saving time are more pronouncedin the southern tier where daylight changes more slowlythroughout the year In Miami for example it takes until mid-May for sunrise to return to the same time it occurred before the time changeSwitching the clocks continually reignites debate about the but its easy to forget that doing sohelps redistribute daylight to moreuseful hours of the day If we were to scrap DST entirely and stay on standard time all year it would already be getting light around 5 am in late April and in many places as early as 4 am come JuneOf course whether you love or hate daylight saving time  More evening light is welcomed if you live in the eastern part of a time zone (such as Massachusettsor Maine) At the western edge of a time zone (Indiana or Michigan) daylight saving time robs residentsof already scarce morning daylightAs long as DST remains in usethe century-old practice will continue to have its supporters and detractors No one likes losing an hour of precious time and sleep but its a price worth paying for that extra hour of evening sunshineIn addition to charges against President Trumps former campaign chairman Paul Manafort that were released on Monday there was another unexpected development in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 electionGeorge Papadopoulos identified in March 2016 as an adviser to the Trump campaign during an interview with  admitted to having provided false statements to the FBI about his interactions with individuals tied to the Russian government Papadopouloss credentials as a foreign-policy adviser were questioned immediately by observers a 2009 college graduate his LinkedIn page included his work with model United Nations as an honor and awardAccording to a document unsealed by the FBI on Monday Papadopoulos admits to having been contacted by Russian agents shortly after being identified as a campaign adviser contacts that continued for months After being arrested in July he then meets with authorities multiple times to answer questions details revealed only once the Manafort indictment is made publicBelow a timeline of what the  Papadopoulos learns that he will serve as an adviser to Trumps campaign (The timing isnt clear it may have been a day before or after this date) While in Italy Papadopoulos meets a professor based in London who is initially uninterested in Papadopoulos  until Papadopoulos explains that hes working for Trumps campaign Papadopoulos is interested in the professor because the professor has links to the Kremlin which Papadopoulos believed would be useful in bolstering his position with the campaign Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta is sent an email including a fraudulent link to change his Google password Its believed that this email was sent by an agent of the Russian government and was used to illegally access his email account Trump meets with The Post and  several campaign advisers including Papadopoulos Papadopouloss credentials are quickly  Papadopoulos and the professor meet in London They are joined by a woman who claims to be a niece of Russian President Vladimir Putin The purpose of the meeting he later writes in an email to the Campaign Supervisor and several members of the Campaigns foreign policy team (per the statement) is to arrange a meeting between Trump and PutinWho the campaign supervisor is isnt clear At that point the Trump campaign is being managed by Corey Lewandowski In August The Post  that Sam Clovis a campaign co-chairman who worked with the foreign policy team had rejected the idea of a meeting over the short termWe thought we probably should not go forward with any meeting with the Russians until we have had occasion to sit with our NATO allies he wrote in an emailFrom our reportIn the same email chain [adviser Navy Rear Adm Charles] Kubic the retired admiral reminded others about legal restrictions on meetings with certain Russian officials adding Just want to make sure that no one on the team outruns their headlights and embarrasses the campaign Manafort is hired to manage the Trump campaigns delegate process At a campaign national security meeting in Washington (also attended by Trump) Papadopoulos tells the group that he had connections that could facilitate a meeting with PutinTrump tweeted an image from the meeting Jeff Sessions then a senator from Alabama is seated in the foreground and is speaking Papadopoulos is sitting two chairs to Sessionss left Trump is at the head of the table   Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump)  Papadopoulos emails the foreign policy team to update them about ongoing discussions with the professor and Putins niece He details his outreach to RussiaAt some point this month the Democratic National Committees server is illegally accessed by hackers believed to be connected to the Russian government Its the second such intrusion the first occurred in the summer of 2015 In an email exchange with the niece and the professor Papadopoulos mentions trying to set up a potential foreign policy trip to Russia The professor replies that it has already been agreed and mentions that hell be in Moscow later that month for meetings at the Russian Duma and a Valdai meeting (There is  on April 19 that Mifsud attended)The niece replies I have already alerted my personal links to our conversation and your request  As mentioned we are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr Trump The Russian Federation would love to welcome him once his candidature would be officially announced During the period that the professor says hell be in Russia he introduces Papadopoulos over email to a Russian who has connections with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Later  from The Post indicates that this may be Ivan Timofeev of the Russian International Affairs Council Papadopoulos and the MFA connection (as the statement describes this person) have multiple conversations over Skype and email about setting up a meeting between the campaign and government officials The MFA connection and Papadopoulos discuss meetings in Moscow or London Papadopoulos and the professor meet in London At that meeting the professor tells Papadopoulos that while in Moscow he learned that the Russians had obtained dirt on then-candidate [Hillary] Clinton Per Papadopoulos the professor said that They have dirt on her the Russians had emails of Clinton they have thousands of emails Papadopoulos emails a senior campaign staffer to indicate that hes gotten some interesting messages He also emails a high-ranking campaign official to reiterate that Putin would like to host Trump The Posts August report indicates that the high-ranking official who was told about Putin wanting to meet was Lewandowski Papadopoulos emails the professor to thank him for his help saying that its history making if the meeting happens The MFA connection emails PapadopoulosI have just talked to my colleagues from the MFA it reads The[y] are open for cooperation One of the options is to make a meeting for you at the North America Desk if you are in MoscowPapadopoulos forwards this to Lewandowski and the next day to the campaign supervisor who is probably Clovis Lewandowski doesnt reply Clovis says [t]here are legal issues we need to mitigate meeting with foreign officials as a private citizen Papadopoulos emails another high-ranking campaign official  Manafort according to The Posts August report  informing him that Russia has been eager to meet Mr Trump for quite sometime and have been reaching out to me to discussManafort forwards the email to Rick Gates (who was also indicted on Monday) We need someone to communicate that [Trump] is not doing these trips he writes It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal Papadopoulos tries to set up an off-the-record meeting between the campaign and Russian officials possibly including himselfThe Russian ministry of foreign affairs messaged and said that if Mr Trump is unable to make it to Russia if a campaign rep (me or someone else) can make it for meetings he emails a campaign official on June 19 I am willing to make the trip off the record if its in the interest of Mr Trump and the campaign to meet specific peopleThe meeting never happens WikiLeaks begins releasing emails stolen from the DNCDuring a news conference Trump  that Russia probably [has] her 33000 emails  referring to emails deleted by Clinton after her service in the State Department because her lawyers didnt believe them to be related to her tenure WikiLeaks begins releasing emails stolen from Podesta Papadopoulos is interviewed at the FBI During that interview he makes false statements about the above interactions He claims The FBI interviews him again Papadopoulos deactivates his Facebook account It had included information about his conversations with the professor Robert Mueller is appointed as special counsel to investigate Russian meddling in the election Papadopoulos is arrested at Dulles Airport in Washington Papadopoulos [meets] with the Government on numerous occasions to provide information and answer questions Hot Air  that references to Papadopoulos in a request to seal his statement as a proactive cooperator matches a description used for witnesses who wear wires as part of investigations Papadopoulos admits that the statements he gave the FBI are false and agrees to the timeline and details above The statement of offense is unsealed the same day that indictments against Manafort and Gates are made publicSouth Korea abruptly shut down an industrial complex just over the border in North Korea on Wednesday cutting off a major source of income for the regime in Pyongyang as punishment for its extremely provocative In an unusually harshly worded statement Seoul flatly accused the North of using money made from inter-Korean projects for its nuclear and missile programsAbout $120 million flowed into North Korea through the Kaesong industrial complex last year alone the Souths Unification Ministry said In the 12 years since the complex was established North Korea had made a total of about $560 million from the siteIt appears that such funds have not been used to pave the way to peace as the international community had hoped but rather to upgrade its nuclear weapons and long-range missiles the ministry said As a result President Park Geun-hyes government said it had completely shut down the complex    But the Unification Ministry statement said the international community needed to come up with a vigorous response to a recent nuclear test and rocket launch that exacts a price for North Koreas misguided actions as well as extraordinary measures that compel North Korea to give up its nuclear capabilities and change its waysSeparately Japan on Wednesday announced new unilateral economic sanctions on North Korea in response to the tests banning North Korean citizens from coming into Japan and North Korean ships from calling at Japanese ports Transfers of money except for humanitarian gifts of less than $800 will also be prohibitedMeanwhile South Koreas Yonhap news agency reported Wednesday that the North executed its army chief of staff Ri Yong Gil this month for corruption and factional conspiracy If true it would be the latest in a series of executions purges and disappearances under leader Kim Jong UnLast month North Korea carried out its fourth nuclear test claiming it tested a more powerful hydrogen bomb but analysts say it was another atomic blast similar to the previous three On Sunday the North launched a rocket that it said carried a satellite into orbit The West and allies however viewed the launch as another step in developing technology for a ballistic missile programThe United States South Korea and Japan were already leading the charge at the United Nations to impose another round of sanctions on North Korea in response to the nuclear test when the rocket was launched  Immediately after Sundays rocket launch Parks government said it was  on deploying a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) antimissile system in South Korea Seoul had been cautious about the move for fear of angering Beijing but the North Korean tests appeared to have spurred Parks government into actionThe South also increased anti-regime broadcasts into North Korea through loudspeakers lined up along the demilitarized zone that separates the two countriesCheong Seong-chang a North Korea specialist at the Sejong Institute outside Seoul said that the South Korean government appeared to be making emotional decisions when dealing with the Norths provocationsOpening a discussion with the US about THAAD which China and Russia are strongly against means that South Koreas relations with these two countries will get worse Cheong said But good relations with China and Russia is vital to work on sanctions on North KoreaPlus it would not have the desired impact because North Korea could just get its workers to produce for Chinese companies he addedCompanies whose factories were shut down were unhappyIt is unfair and emotional for the government to come to this conclusion without giving the companies any time to minimize possible damages said Chung Ki-sup head of the council of South Korean companies in Kaesong according to local media reportsAfter similar tests in 2013 the South Korean government promised that the Kaesong complex would be allowed to operate separately from politics he said We urge the government to review todays decision  Chung saidAidan Foster-Carter a Korea analyst based in Britain called shutting down Kaesong stupid short-sighted and inconsistent Soon after Park was elected in 2013 she worked hard to reopen Kaesong after it was closed by the North and both sides agreed that the two Koreas will not make Kaesong suffer again Foster-Carter saidThat too followed [North Korean] nuclear and missile tests so why has Park changed her mind done a U-turn and broken a pledge he asked Fifield reported from TokyoIts 2017 When your name catches the attention of a big enough portion of the worlds population an extremely reliable phenomenon follows Peopletry to find you on social media And if all that attention is because youve done something that has made people mad theyre going to insult you  sometimes worse  anywhere they can find you online Your mentions become a personalized comments section of the worst kindBut what if all those angry people who think theyve found their target are wrong It happens  ask On Monday it happened again this time to a financial planner who happens to have the exact same name asGeorge Papadopoulos the former Trump campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to federal officials earlier this month  When that plea was announced on Monday some people started tweeting at @feeonlyplanner a verified account for one George Papadopoulos that pops up in a Twitter search That account belongs to the financial planner who also contributes to a Wall Street Journal blog on wealth management and  the former Trump adviser The Trump-connected Papadopoulos doesnt appear to have a verified accountWhen is your court date You lied to the FBI for the liar in chief This doesnt end well for anyone associated with 45  tagging Papadopouloss handle Othersfollowed suitMaybe before  stopped using his Facebook he told  about his Russian interactions  Kelly Lannen (@KellyLannen) Are you tweeting in court Dr ola (@olarchi) Papadopoulos the non-Trump one was in Greece when the news about the Other Papadopoulos broke He guesses hes received hundreds if not thousands of tweets on Monday  both from people who are mistaking him for the one in the news and from those who are offering him support in this trying time to be a George Papadopoulos onlineI am visiting my elderly mother in Greece to attend to some of her affairs and of course enjoying her home cooking Papadopoulos told The Post in an email on Monday afternoon I had finished an amazing lunch dish she prepared for me and wanted to quickly check online how the morning was starting back in the US And then the news hit And the deluge startedAt first he tried to reply to every mistaken tweet but it became apparent pretty quickly that this was not humanely possible he said So he tried to clarify to everyone that he wasnt the guy they were looking forFor the nth time I am NOT Trumps foreign policy adviser I have NO association with the Trump camp NONE George Papadopoulos (@feeonlyplanner) But somehow that tweet seemed to trigger another round of insults from random Twitter users who believed this Papadopoulos was definitely the one who pleaded guilty and that his tweet was merely an attempt to distance himself from the Trump administrationTrump personally said you were in May

these confused insults Papadopoulos said the tweet also got him a lot of support including from other people on Twitter who share names with the famous or infamousI feel your pain George JohnKelly (@JohnKelly) Eventually Papadopoulos decided to explainwhat the heck was happening online to him to his momAt first my mother was proud because she thought I was very popular and made it to the White House Papadopoulos emailed to The Post from Greece After I explained to her what happened in more detail we just laughed about it George Papadopoulos is a very common Greek name Everybody knows one or two I heard a joke in the local TV here how Greeks are so powerful they have a George Papadopoulos in the White House and the KremlinOn Twitter hes more or less taking this bizarre situation in

bill that would allow women who become pregnant as a result of a rape to terminate their attackers parental rights has received key legislative support and after nine years of failed attempts appears likely to be approved next year Senate President Thomas V Mike Miller Jr (D-Calvert) said last week on social media that he plans to co-sponsor the bill during the next legislative session which begins in JanuaryI have shared publicly and privately my disappointment that the Rape Survivor Family Protection Act did not make it to the floor until Sine Die and did not pass the Legislature in time Miller  Senate Democratic leadership is going to make clear this [is] a priority and the bill will be taken up early Miller said he would co-sponsor the bill when the legislature reconvenes in January and would make it a top priority to make sure victims of rape are protected and not forced to co-parent with their rapistEarlier this month House Speaker Michael E Busch (D-Anne Arundel) said he also planned to co-sponsor the bill and said it would be a top priority in the new sessionMontgomery County Democrats Del Kathleen M Dumais and Sen Brian J Feldman have been lead sponsors on the legislation for yearsThis protection is long overdue and victims of sexual assault need us to take action Busch wrote on FacebookAlmost 25 other states have passed similar laws The Maryland after key members of a conference committee panel could not reach a compromise over the House and Senate versions that two committee chairmen who appointed the conference panel did not include female lawmakers in the group and waited until the end of the 90-day session to try to resolve the differences in the House and Senate versionsMuch of last years debate on the bill centered around whether an alleged rapist would have to be criminally convicted to have his parental rights revoked About 20 of the states who have such a bill require a rape conviction before terminating parental rightsAdvocates argued that Maryland allows parental rights to be terminated in child-abuse cases even when there is no criminal child-abuse conviction The same standard should apply they say in cases of sexual assaultUnder the bill a woman who sought to terminate a mans parental rights would have to prove through clear and convincing evidence the standard used in civil court that the man had sexually assaulted her The burden-of-proof standard is higher in criminal court where charges must be proved beyond a reasonable doubtWith days left in the 2017 session the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee struck language from the bill that said that courts could not require publication of the name of the mother or child in such cases and added language that said the father could refuse to testify or offer evidence in court The amendment forced the need for the conference committeeJake Weissmann deputy chief of staff for Miller said Monday that there were no details available about a compromise bill just a commitment that were going to get this done Lisae C Jordan executive director of the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assaults said it has been incredibly frustrating and

protect citizens from people like youNeither Trump nor his aides offered any citation to back up Trumps accusation about Obama Trump may have been prompted by a report on the conservative website Breitbart and commentary from talk radio host Mark Levin suggesting that the Obama administration used police state tactics to monitor the Trump team The Breitbart report circulated among Trumps senior aides Friday and early Saturday and Trump may have simply been reacting to the piece when he took to his preferred megaphone Twitter to trumpet his claimTrumps tweets punctuated a general feeling shared by the president his advisers and allies that Obama and the Deep State of critics within the intelligence community  who they think are fueling stories on Trump and Russia  have been conspiring to derail his presidency At the heart of each of the presidents tweets is Trumps apparent belief that Obama himself  as opposed to members of his administration  had been personally overseeing surveillance of Trump TowerThe conservative media landscape  including Sean Hannitys show on Fox News and Infowars the conspiracy website run by Alex Jones outlets on which Trump has appeared  has in recent days given birth to tales of Obama and his closest confidants trying to spur Trumps impeachment or force his resignationBut separately the president is furious that a slow churn of revelations about communications between Attorney General Jeff Sessions ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn and other Trump associates and Russian officials has overshadowed the early weeks of his administration And he has grown fixated on identifying leakers Hes angry and he thinks that the leaks  even forgetting the rhetoric on politics  are a significant problem that hurts

among activists on the right about entrenched bureaucrats in the intelligence and defense agencies according to White House officialsRoger Stone a longtime political adviser to Trump who does not work in the administration but still talks with the president said he is urging Trump to fire and prosecute anyone who leaks damaging informationWhat the president doesnt understand is he has more power

messagesTrump was incensed over Sessionss decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe after The Washington Post reported that Sessions had met twice with the Russian ambassador but then testified falsely at his Senate confirmation hearing that he did not have communications with the Russians In the Oval Office on Friday morning Trump fumed at his senior staff about the Sessions situation and

well as dinner with both men and other advisers including BannonIf the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court approved a wiretapping order on one of Trumps associates that would mean the federal judge involved had decided there was probable cause that the person was colluding with a foreign governmentSome current and former intelligence officials cast doubt on Trumps wiretapping assertionIts extremely unlikely that there would have been any sort of criminal or intelligence surveillance of Trump said Jennifer Daskal a former senior Justice Department national security official Theres no credible evidence yet to suggest that that happened It would be an extraordinary measure for the FBI to ask for and the court to grant a surveillance order on a presidential candidate of the opposing party in an election year Most Republican leaders were quiet on the issue Saturday but Sen Lindsey O Graham (R-SC) vowed at a town hall meeting with constituents to get to the bottom of this He said it would be the biggest scandal since Watergate if Obama illegally spied on Trump or if a judge approved a warrant to monitor Trumps campaign for possible communications with RussiaIm very worried that our president is suggesting that the former president has done something illegally Graham said At the same time because of what it would signal I would be very worried if in fact the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity with foreign governmentsSen Ben Sasse (R-Neb) called for Trump to provide the public more information about his charges We are in the midst of a civilization-warping crisis of public trust and the Presidents allegations today demand the thorough and dispassionate attention of serious patriots Sasse said in a

extremely dangerous for the president to be suggesting that he was being surveilled for political purposes when there is absolutely no evidence of that fact she said Jenna Portnoy in Palm Beach Fla

saidThe calls were orchestrated by the White House after unsuccessful attempts by the administration to get senior FBI officials to speak with news organizations and dispute the accuracy of stories on the alleged contacts with RussiaThe White House on Friday acknowledged those interactions with the FBI but did not disclose that it then turned to other officials who agreed to do what the FBI would not  participate in White House-arranged calls with news organizations including The Washington Post Two of those officials spoke on the condition of anonymity  a practice President Trump has condemnedThe officials broadly dismissed Trump associates contacts with Russia as infrequent and inconsequential But the officials would not answer substantive questions about the issue and their comments were not published by The Post and do not appear to have been reported elsewhereWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer confirmed that the White House communicated with officials with the aim of contesting reporting on Russia but maintained that the administration did nothing improper When informed by the FBI that [the Russia-related reporting] was false we told reporters who else they should contact to corroborate the FBIs version of the story he said The decision to involve those officials could be perceived as threatening the independence of US spy agencies that are supposed to remain insulated from partisan issues as well as undercutting the credibility of ongoing  Those officials saw their involvement as an attempt to correct coverage they believed to be erroneousThe effort also involved senior lawmakers with access to classified intelligence about Russia including Sen Richard Burr (R-NC) and Rep Devin Nunes (R-Calif) the chairmen of the Senate and House intelligence committees A spokesman for Nunes said that he had already begun speaking to reporters to challenge the story and that at the request of a White House communications aide Chairman Nunes then spoke to an additionalreporter and delivered the same message Unlike the others Nunes spoke on the record and was subsequently quoted in the Wall Street JournalIn an interview Burr acknowledged that he had conversations about Russia-related news reports with the White House and engaged with news organizations to dispute articles by the New York Times and CNN that alleged repeated or constant contact between Trump campaign members and Russian intelligence operatives  Ive had those conversations Burr said adding that he regarded the contacts as appropriate provided that I felt I had something to share that didnt breach my responsibilities to the committee in an ongoing investigationThe administrations push against the Russia coverage intensified Sunday when White House Chief of Staff  said in television interviews that he had been authorized by the top levels of the intelligence community to denounce reports on Trump campaign contacts with Russia as falsePriebuss denunciations ranged from calling the articles overstated to saying they were complete garbageAdministration officials said that Priebuss comments had been cleared by FBI Director James B Comey and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe In doing so the FBIs leadership would appear to have been drawing a distinction between authorizing comments by a White House official and addressing the matter themselves Mark Warner the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said he called CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Burr to express his grave concerns about what this means for the independence of the investigationI am consulting with members of the Intelligence Committee to determine an appropriate course of action so we can ensure that the American people get the thorough impartial investigation that they deserve free from White House interference Warner said in a statement Friday nightRep Adam B Schiff (Calif) the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee issued a statement Friday evening saying that if the White House contrived to have intelligence officials contradict unfavorable news reports this represents a new and even more grave threat to the independence of the intelligence communityFormer intelligence officials expressed concern over the blurring of lines between intelligence and politics with some recalling Republican accusations that the Obama administration had twisted intelligence in its accounts of the 2012 attacks on US facilities in Benghazi LibyaI doubt that there was any enthusiasm from the intelligence leadership to get involved in this in the first place former CIA director Michael Hayden said noting that it seemed unlikely that Priebuss bluntly worded denials were consistent with the precise language favored by intelligence analystsThink Benghazi here Hayden said in an interview by email This is what happens when the intel guys are leaned on for the narrative of the political speakers The latter have different rules words purposes Getting intel into that mix always ends unhappily [and] it looks like we just didThe Trump administrations actions reflect its level of concern about coverage of its relationship with Russia Trump has continued to praise Russian President Vladimir Putin even after US intelligence agencies concluded that  to help Trump winTrump has also repeatedly disparaged the intelligence agencies that his administration last week turned to for support Shortly before taking office Trump accused US spy agencies of a to smear himThe White House statements on the issue Friday came after CNN reported that the  to publicly knock down media reports about ties between Trump associates and Russian intelligenceAdministration officials disputed the account saying that rather than soliciting FBI feedback Priebus had been pulled aside by McCabe on the morning of Feb15 and told I want you to know that the New York Times story is BSThe FBI declined to discuss the matterWhite House officials declined to comment on the administrations subsequent effort to enlist other government officials and would not agree to allow the identification of the intelligence officials who had spoken to The Post last week In separate calls those individuals insisted on being identified only as a senior intelligence official in the Trump administration and a senior member of the intelligence communityIn a brief interview on the night of Feb15 the senior intelligence official said that the suggestion that there was frequent contact between Russians and Trump associates was false describing any conversations as sporadic limited and based on Russias interest in building a relationship with the future Trump administration rather than shaping the 2016 presidential raceThe senior intelligence official appeared to be referring to contacts between Trumps designated national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump was sworn in as president Flynn was forced out of his job earlier this month after The Post reported that  against Russia with Kislyak and then misled Trump administration officials about the nature of his contactsOfficials at the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on whether senior officials at those agencies had discussed Russia coverage with the White House or been involved in efforts to refute stories on that subjectCIA Director Mike Pompeo is the senior-most intelligence official in the administration with former senator Dan Coats (R-Ind) still awaiting confirmation as director of national intelligenceAs a Republican member of Congress  in the House investigation of Benghazi which centered on accusations that the Obama administration had twisted intelligence about the attacks for political purposesIt is not unusual for CIA leaders to have contact with news organizations particularly about global issues such as terrorism or to contest news accounts of CIA operations But involving the agency on alleged Trump campaign ties to Russia could be problematicThe CIA is not in charge of the investigation Given the history of domestic espionage abuses in the United States CIA officials are typically averse to being drawn into matters that involve US citizens or might make the agency vulnerable to charges that it is politicizing intelligenceA US intelligence official declined to discuss any Pompeo involvement except to say that he was not involved in drafting or approving statements for public use by the White House this past weekend on alleged Russian contactsWhether there were such contacts remains a major point of contention Beyond Flynn the investigation has focused on other figures including  Trumps former campaign chairman who had previously served as a paid political adviser to the Putin-backed president of UkraineUS intelligence reports cite multiple contacts between members of Trumps team and Russians with links to the Kremlin during the campaign and afterward according to officials who have seen them Such reports were based on intercepted Russian communications and other sources the officials said Nunes who served as a member of Trumps transition team has resisted calls for his House committee to investigate alleged contacts between Trump associates and Russia He said in an interview that after months of investigations US authorities have turned up no evidence of such contactsTheyve looked and its all a dead trail that leads me to believe no contact not even pizza-delivery-guy contact Nunes said appearing to rule out even unwitting contact between Trump officials and Russian agents Investigators Nunes said dont even have a lead Philip Rucker Ellen Nakashima and Julie Tate contributed to this reportPresident Trump just backed down from what could have been a serious fight with ChinaOn Thursday evening in Washington he appeared to shy away from confrontation with Beijing by agreeing to honor the one-China policy during a lengthy telephone call with Chinas President Xi JinpingThe move is set to ease tensions between the worlds two most powerful nations relations had been inflamed after Trump suggested he would only commit to the one-China policy if Beijing addressed his concerns about trade and currency issuesExperts had previously noted with concern that Trump had not spoken to Xi since his inauguration despite speaking or meeting with at least 18 other world leaders  although the two men did talk by phone days after Trumps election victory  In a statement issued late Thursday the White House said the two men had held a lengthy and extremely cordial conversationThe two leaders discussed numerous topics and President Trump agreed at the request of President Xi to honor our one-China policy the White House statement saidIn return Xi said he appreciated his US counterpart Donald Trump for stressing that the US government adheres to the one-China policy which he called the political basis of relations between the two nations state news agency Xinhua reportedThe development of China and the United States absolutely can complement each other and advance together Both sides can absolutely become very good cooperative partners Xi saidThe one-China policy was first agreed by President Nixon and Chinas leader Mao Zedong in 1972 and formed the bedrock for the establishment of diplomatic ties under President Carter in 1979 It rules out independence and diplomatic recognition for the island of TaiwanTrumps insistence that it was open for negotiation had brought a sharp rebuke from China which insisted the policy was highly sensitive and non-negotiableIt was not clear if Trump had gained any concessions from China in return for endorsing the policy  Xinhua said the two men agreed to strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation in trade economic investment and international affairsMuch more likely experts said Trump might simply have been persuaded that relations would never get off the ground without endorsing the one-China ideaLawyer James Zimmerman former head of the American Chamber of Commerce in China said Trump never should have raised the one-China policy in the first place and had now backed down probably because he realized it was a complicated thorny issue that is simply not open for discussion There is certainly a way of negotiating with the Chinese but threats concerning fundamental core interests are counterproductive from the get-go he said The end result is that Trump just confirmed to the world that he is a paper tiger a zhilaohu  someone that seems threatening but is wholly ineffectual and unable to stomach a challengeNi Feng deputy director of the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing said Trumps previous comments had sent the relationship between the two countries tumbling and collapsing adding that he believed that was why the phone call had been delayedWithout acknowledgement of the one-China policy Sino-US relations cannot proceed he said No president has ever refused to acknowledge it since the US and China established diplomatic relations in the 70s and no US president has ever created such confusionNow we can say that Sino-US relations can proceed he saidLv Xiang another Sino-US relations expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said by mentioning at the request of President Xi in the White House statement the United States might want to show that they still have reservations on the issueHowever Lv said the one China policy had been a very important topic in preliminary conversations leading up to the phone call The precondition of the call was the basic understanding and acceptance of the one-China policy he saidForeign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang would not be drawn on the consultations and negotiations leading up to the call saying only that adhering to the one-China principle is theobligation that any American government should fulfill and adding that theunshaken upholding of this policy is very important for the healthy and stable development of bilateral tiesTaiwans presidential spokesman Huang Chung-yen suggested his administration had been warned in advance  that Taipei and Washington have been in close contact and communication regarding this development and continue to take an effective zero surprise approachIn recent days he said the US administration including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson hadon multiple occasions reiterated its support for Taiwan The timing of the phone call also appeared significant coming on the eve of a formal summit between Trump and Japans Prime Minister Shinzo Abe set to take place in Washington on FridayJapan is a historic enemy of China and a key modern-day strategic rivaland Beijing is sure to be watching that summit extremely closely Trump is likely to use the occasion to reinforce his commitment to the mutual defense pact between United States and Japan a policy that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis took pains to underline on a visit to Tokyo last weekIn December following his election and before his transition Trump made waves with a protocol-breaking Tsai Ing-wenIt was the first communication between leaders of the United States and Taiwan since 1979 and the product of months of preparation by Trumps advisers who advocated for a new strategy of engagement with Taiwan to rattle ChinaAs expected China reacted sternly but then Trump publicly questioned whether the one-China policy was in the United States best interestsHe fired off provocative tweets about the Chinese  on currency manipulation imports from the United States and its military buildup in the South China SeaIn December Trump suggested he would use Taiwans status as a bargaining chip telling Fox News I dont know why we have to be bound by a one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things including trade In January shortly before his inauguration he that he was open to shifting US policy on China and TaiwanEverything is under negotiation including one-China Trump told saidDespite closing its embassy in Taipei in 1979 the United States remains Taiwans biggest ally and arms supplier and is bound by legislation to provide the means for the island to defend itselfDefeated nationalist forces fled to the island in 1949 after losing a civil war to the CommunistsThe White House said representatives from both countries will engage in discussions and negotiations on various issues of mutual interest The two leaders also extended invitations to meet in their respective countries and look forward to further talks with very successful outcomesThe phone call to Xi came a day after Trump sent a letter wishing China a prosperous Year of the Rooster  sent 11 days after China celebrated its Lunar New Year festival In that letter Trump also said he looked forward to working with Xi todevelop a constructive relationship that benefits both nations the White House saidOn Wednesday a US Navy P-3C Orion surveillance aircraft was engaged in what the US Pacific Command called an unsafe interaction with a Chinese military KJ-200 aircraft in international airspace over the South China Sea aircraft We will address the issue in appropriate diplomatic and military channels said Pacific Command spokesman Maj Rob Shuford said in a statement Friday Such incidents are not uncommon though and the two nations militaries have improved communications in recent years to make them less common and less threateningTalking to the Global Times newspaper an unnamed Chinese Foreign Minstry official said the incident had taken place near the island of Hainan when two Chinese fighters had followed and monitored the US plane while maintaining a safe distanceNo dangerous action was taken the official said Rucker reported from Washington Congcong Zhang and Luna Lin contributed from

positionAs US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Bharara who was born in India and whose parents brought him to the United States as a child heads one of the highest-profile federal prosecutors offices in the country  The president-elect asked presumably because hes a New Yorker and is aware of the great work that our office has done over the past seven years asked to meet with me to discuss whether or not Id be prepared to stay on as the United States attorney to do the work as we have done it independently without fear or favor for the last seven years Bharara said in a brief statement to reporters on Wednesday after meeting with Trump at Trump TowerWe had a good meeting he said I agreed to stay onBharara said he has already spoken to US Sen Jeff Sessions (R-Ala) who

office by President Obama in 2009 He oversees 227 prosecutors making it the second-largest US Attorneys office in the country Over the years the office has earned the somewhat sarcastic moniker of the

high-profile prosecutions including winning convictions last year of the leaders of both houses of the New York legislature former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver is a Democrat former Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos is a Republican His office also successfully prosecuted dozens of cases involving insider trading on Wall Street Time Magazine put him on its 2012 cover with the headline This man

September that injured more than 30 peopleSeveral weeks after Donald Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination his national campaign co-chairman urged a foreign policy adviser to meet with Russian officials to foster ties with that countrys governmentMake the trip if it is feasible Sam Clovis wrote in an August email to George PapadopoulosThe email included in court papers unsealed Monday shows how an otherwise low-profile adviser has become a focus of the federal probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and the KremlinPapadopoulos was in contact with several senior Trump campaign aides about his efforts to broker a relationship between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin the court papers show In addition to Clovis who now serves as senior White House adviser to the US Department of Agriculture Papadopoulos wrote to campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and campaign chairman Paul Manafort the newly released documents showThe campaign officials are not identified in court documents but some of the emails cited by federal prosecutors match messages described in August to The Washington Post by people familiar with their contentsThe newly released documents show that while senior Trump officials at times rebuffed or ignored Papadopoulos they were well aware of his efforts which went on for months His interactions with them could complicate the White Houses attempts to distance the president from Papadopoulos who pleaded guilty Oct 5 to lying to federal agents  Trump himself knew of Papadopouloss claims that he had a pipeline to Moscow During a March 2016 meeting of the campaigns national security advisers in Washington that Trump attended Papadopoulos said he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between the then-candidate and PutinOn Monday White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she was not sure that the president recalls specific details of the meeting calling it brief She described Papadopouloss role with the campaign as extremely limitedIn a statement Cloviss attorney Victoria Toensing said Clovis a radio host from Iowa who was one of Trumps earliest supporters always vigorously opposed any Russian trip for Donald Trump and/or the campaignShe said Clovis was being polite when he encouraged Papadopoulos to meet with Russian officials in August adding that the campaign had a strict rule that no person could travel abroad as a representative of the campaign Clovis could not stop an American citizen from traveling abroad in his personal capacity she saidClovis has been nominated to be the top science adviser at the USDA His hearing before the Senate Agriculture Committee is scheduled for Nov 9Lewandowski did not respond to a request for commentIn a statement Papadopouloss attorneys Thomas Breen and Robert Stanley said they would refrain from commenting on the caseWe will have the opportunity to comment on Georges involvement when called upon by the Court at a later date they said We look forward to telling all of the details of Georges story at that timeTrump first identified Papadopoulos as one of his advisers  describing him as an energy and oil consultant Excellent guy  Papadopoulos was charged under seal in July and was arrested when he arrived at Dulles International Airport on July 27 His plea agreement indicates that he is cooperating with special counsel Robert S Mueller III He pleaded guilty in October to lying to federal agents about his contacts with people with connections to the Russian government filings showPapadopouloss efforts to arrange a meeting with Russian officials began days after he was named to Trumps campaign team and continued for months At one point he emailed Lewandowski to discuss Russias interest in hosting Mr Trump Have been receiving a lot of calls over the last month about Putin wanting to host him and the team when the time is right according to documentsA month later he  in an email to ManafortIn response Manafort forwarded Papadopouloss offer to his deputy Rick Gates writing We need someone to communicate that [Trump] is not doing these trips It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signalManafort spokesman Jason Maloni told The Post in August that the campaign chairmans response indicated that any invitation by Russia directly or indirectly would be rejected outright Papadopouloss proposed trip ultimately did not take place court documents show  According to court papers Papadopoulos lied to federal agents about one of his key contacts a London-based professor he met in Italy in March 2016 days after he joined the Trump campaignIn a subsequent meeting in April the professor told Papadopoulos that the Russian government had dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton including thousands of Clintons emailsThat conversation occurred weeks before the Democratic National Committee revealed that it had been hacked and believed that Russians were behind the attack It also came about a month after an email account belonging to Clintons campaign chairman John Podesta was targeted with a phishing attempt that may have led to the hack of his emails  by WikiLeaks in October 2016One email quoted in court filings regarding the professor matches an exchange previously described to The Post in which Papadopoulos identified the professor as Joseph Mifsud the director of the London Academy of DiplomacyThat document as well as emails with Clovis and other top campaign aides was among more than 20000 pages that the Trump campaign turned over to congressional committees after review by White House and defense lawyersMifsud told The Post in an email in August that he had absolutely no contact with the Russian government and said his only ties to Russia were through academic links He did not respond to a request for comment MondayWhen asked about the unsealed indictments Monday Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said We dont know what the charges are After being sent a copy of the indictments he responded My office hours are overPapadopoulos also communicated with a Russian woman with ties to the government and a man in Moscow he believed was connected to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs filings showAt the time Papadopoulos incorrectly believed that the Russian woman was a niece of Putin according to court documentsWe are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr Trump she wrote to him in April 2016 The Russian Federation would love to welcome him once his candidature would be officially announced  According to court filings she told Papadopoulos that she would like to help set up meetings with her associates to discuss US-Russia ties under a future President TrumpAfter Papadopoulos emailed campaign officials about her offer Clovis responded that he would work it through the campaign but added Great workToensing described Clovis as a polite gentleman from Iowa who would always have been courteous to a person offering to help the campaignClovis played a key role in boosting Trump during the Iowa caucuses but his influence within the campaign subsequently waned amid tense relations with Trumps son-in-law and adviser Jared KushnerDuring a Jan 27 2017 interview with FBI agents Papadopoulos said he had met the Russian woman before he joined the Trump campaign and falsely stated that he had no relationship with her according to court filingsThe day after his second interview with FBI agents in February Papadopoulos deactivated his Facebook account which had information about his outreach to Russian officials  a move prosecutors said was aimed at obstructing their investigationPapadopoulos who has a scant foreign policy background briefly advised the 2016 presidential campaign of neurosurgeon Ben CarsonWhen Trump identified Papadopoulos as an adviser in March 2016 the hotel and real estate executive was rising in the field of Republican presidential candidates and his campaign was eager to show that it had credible voices offering advice on foreign policy Among the other advisers he named that day was  whose ties to Russia have been under scrutiny Throughout the summer Papadopoulos met with foreign officials and gave interviews to media in other countries sometimes describing Trumps views on Putin or RussiaHe told a group of researchers in Israel that Trump saw Putin as a responsible actor and potential partner according to a column in the Jerusalem Post later he met with a British Foreign Office representative in London and a Greek official in New York British and Greek embassy spokesmen have said He also criticized US sanctions on Russia in an interview with the Russian news outlet InterfaxThe Post has also reported that  contained in a dossier about Trumps ties to Russia told people around him that he was in contact with Papadopoulos during the campaign Robert Costa Carol D Leonnig and Philip Rucker in Washington Karla Adam in London and David Filipov in Moscow contributed to this reportThree days after Donald Trump named his campaign foreign policy team in March 2016 the youngest of the new advisers sent an email to seven campaign officials with the subject line Meeting with Russian Leadership - Including PutinThe adviser  offered to set up a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss US-Russia ties under President Trump telling them his Russian contacts welcomed the opportunityaccording to internal campaign emails read to The Washington PostThe proposal sent a ripple of concern through campaign headquarters in Trump Tower Campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis wrote that he thought NATO allies should be consulted before any plans were made Another Trump adviser retired Navy Rear Adm Charles Kubic cited legal concerns including a possible violation of US sanctions against Russia and of the Logan Act which prohibits US citizens from unauthorized negotiation with foreign governmentsBut Papadopoulos a campaign volunteer with scant foreign policy experience persisted Between March and September the self-described energy consultant sent at least a half-dozen requests for Trump as he turned from primary candidate to party nominee or for members of his team to meet with Russian officials Among those to express concern about the effort was then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort who rejected in May 2016 a proposal from Papadopoulos for Trump to do soThe exchanges are among more than 20000 pages of documents the Trump campaign turned over to congressional committees this month after review by White House and defense lawyers The selection of Papadopouloss emails were read to The Post by a person with access to them Two other people with access to the emails confirmed the general tone of the exchanges and some specific passages within them  Papadopoulos emerges from the sample of emails as a new and puzzling figure in the examination of the Trump campaigns contacts with Russian officials and their proxies during the 2016 election now the subject of a special-counsel investigationLess than a decade out of college Papadopoulos appeared to hold little sway within the campaign and it is unclear whether he was acting as an intermediary for the Russian government although he told campaign officials he wasWhile the emails illustrate his eagerness to strengthen the campaigns connections to the Russian government Papadopoulos does not spell out in them why it would be in Trumps interest to do so His entreaties appear to have generated more concern than excitement within the campaign which at the time was looking to seal the Republican nomination and take on a heavily favored Hillary Clinton in the general electionBut the internal resistance to Papadopouloss requests is at odds with other overtures Trump allies were making toward Russia at the time mostly at a more senior level of the campaignThree months after Papadopoulos raised the possibility of a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin the presidents son Donald Trump Jr and son-in-law Jared Kushner met with a delegation led by a Russian lawyer offering to provide damaging information on Clinton  attended that Trump Tower session in June 2016 a meeting now under scrutiny in the special counsels collusion inquiry But the new emails reveal that Manafort had rejected a request from Papadopoulos just the previous month to set up a meeting between Trump and Russian officialsIn July 2016 and again two months later Jeff Sessions then a senator and senior foreign policy adviser to Trump And also in July a few weeks after Papadopoulos asked his superiors whether other campaign advisers or aides could accept some of the Russians invitations Carter Page another foreign policy adviser spoke at a Russian university in Moscow Page said he made the trip independently of the campaignTo experts in Russian intelligence gathering the Papadopoulos chain offers further evidence that Russians were looking for entry points and playing upon connections with lower-level aides to penetrate the 2016 campaignFormer CIA director John Brennan in May told the House Intelligence Committee that he had seen worrisome evidence of contacts and interactions between Russian officials and the Trump campaign although he offered no specificsSteven L Hall who retired from the CIA in 2015 after 30 years of managing the agencys Russia operations said when told by The Post about the emails The bottom line is that theres no doubt in my mind that the Russian government was casting a wide net when they were looking at the American election I think they were doing very basic intelligence work Whos out there Whos willing to play ball And how can we use themPapadopoulos a former intern and researcher at the conservative Hudson Institute was on a list of campaign volunteers that Trump announced as his foreign policy advisory team during  Trump called Papadopoulos an excellent guy Almost immediately Papadopoulos came under scrutiny for his lack of experience He graduated from college in 2009 and his LinkedIn profile cited his participation in a Model UN program for students among his qualifications Papadopoulos did not respond to repeated requests for comment Page who has been the subject of a foreign surveillance warrant over his connections to Russia said the Papadopoulos email exchange was another sign that the Russia communications were inconsequentialThe entirely benign offer from a volunteer member of the Trump movement is infinitely less relevant than the real collusion in the 2016 election said Page who was copied on the first Papadopoulos email communication in March Page said in an email exchange Saturday that the real scandal lies among Clinton and Obama associates who fed false evidence to investigators that he said formed the basis of the federal warrant concerning him   Papadopoulos made more than a half-dozen overtures on behalf of Russians or people with Russia contacts whom he claimed to knowOn March 24 Clovis the campaign co-chairman who also served on the foreign policy team reacted to one proposed Russia meeting by writing We thought we probably should not go forward with any meeting with the Russians until we have had occasion to sit with our NATO alliesIn the same email chain Kubic the retired admiral reminded others about legal restrictions on meetings with certain Russian officials adding Just want to make sure that no one on the team outruns their headlights and embarrasses the campaignUndeterred Papadopoulos alerted then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski in an April email that he was receiving a lot of calls over the past month about arranging a Russia meetingPutin wants to host the Trump team when the time is right he wrote on April 27 On May 4 Papadopoulos forwarded Lewandowski and others a note he received from the program head for the government-funded Russian International Affairs Council In it Ivan Timofeev a senior official in the organization reached out to report that Russian foreign ministry officials were open to a Trump visit to Moscow and requested that the campaign and Russians write a formal letter outlining the meeting Clovis responded to the Timofeev invitation by noting There are legal issues we need to mitigate meeting with foreign officials as a private citizenThe email chain does not show a response from Lewandowski who did not return calls seeking commentSeveral weeks later Papadopoulos forwarded the same message from Timofeev to Manafort the newly named campaign chairmanRussia has been eager to meet with Mr Trump for some time and have been reaching out to me to discuss the adviser told ManafortManafort reacted coolly forwarding the email to his associate Rick Gates with a note We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these tripsGates agreed and told Manafort he would ask the campaigns correspondence coordinator to handle it  the person responding to all mail of non-importance  to signify this did not need a senior official to respond  A spokesman for Manafort whose Virginia home was raided by FBI agents three weeks ago as part of an investigation by special counsel Robert S Mueller III said the email chain provides concrete evidence that the Russia collusion narrative is fake newsMr Manaforts swift action reflects the attitude of the campaign  any invitation by Russia directly or indirectly would be rejected outright Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni said in a statementIn an email to The Post Timofeev confirmed that his organization had discussed a meeting with the Trump campaign in the spring of 2016The Russian International Affairs Council was created in 2010 by a decree of then-President Dmitry Medvedev as a project of various Russian government agencies It is led by former foreign minister Igor Ivanov Its board includes Russias current foreign minister Sergei Lavrov as well as top Russian scholars and business leaders among them the chairman of Alfa-Bank and Sberbank two of Russias largest banksWe discussed the idea informally as one of the opportunities for  dialogue between Russia and the US Timofeev said in the email RIAC often hosts meetings with prominent political figures and experts from the US and many other countriesHe said the group would have been open to meeting with other campaignsClinton spokesman Nick Merrill said officials with the Democrats campaign have no recollections or record of having been

human activity has been the primary driver of climate change to serve in the Agriculture Departments top scientific postDr Clovis was one of the first people through the door at USDA in January and has become a trusted advisor and steady hand as we continue to work for the people of agriculture Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement Wednesday evening He looks at every problem with a critical eye relying on sound science and data and will be the facilitator and integrator we need Dr Clovis has served this nation proudly since he was a very young man and I am happy he is continuing to serveClovis whose expected nomination has been previously reported by The Washington Post and several other outlets is a former economics professor at Morningside College in Sioux City Iowa who served as one of Trumps first campaign policy advisers In a  with Iowa Public Radio he said he was extremely skeptical about climate change and added that a lot of the science is junk scienceIts not proven I dont think theres any substantive information available to me that doesnt raise as many questions as it does answers Clovis said in the interview So Im a skepticThis position represents a departure from the scientific consensus In its most recent report theUN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changethat it is extremely likely that since the 1950s humans and their greenhouse gas emissions have been the dominant cause of the planets warming trendNeither USDA nor Clovis responded to inquiries earlier this week about the prospect of his appointment and his views on climate scienceClovis  who started at USDA as a senior White House adviser just after Trump was inaugurated  possesses a BS in political science an MBA degree and a doctorate in public administration according to the White House The post for which he is being nominated the Agriculture Departments undersecretary for research education and economics has  by a string of individuals with advanced degrees in science or medicineThe overall portfolio that would be managed by Clovis if he is confirmed by the Senate isworth about $ 3 billion with $ 2 billion devoted to research and $ 1 billion to education according to Catherine Woteki a nutrition scientist who held the job before Clovis The person holding the position administers the Agricultural Research Service the Economic Research Service the National Agricultural Statistics Service and the National Institute of Food and AgricultureThe undersecretary also serves as the USDAs chief scientist The specifies that appointees to the post should be chosen from among distinguished scientists with specialized training or significant experience in agricultural research education and economics The measure noted that the job is responsible for the coordination of the research education and extension activities of the DepartmentTheres a huge amount of science that goes into the setting up of the programs implementation of various policies and the chief scientist role is to coordinate those policies across the entire department and to represent agricultural science in the decisionmaking that goes on with other departments and is coordinated with the white house science office said WotekiFurthermore the Agriculture Departments chief scientist is also tasked with administering its policies to ensure scientific integrity in the department which means examining whether any abuses or misuses of science may have occurred in the agencyClimate change is a major issue in the agricultural sector as shifts in both temperatures and precipitation have a major impact on food production Agricultural operations also rank asa major emitter of greenhouse gases linked to climate change because ofmethane emissions from livestock and carbon emissions fromheavy farm equipmentUnder the Obama administration the Agriculture Department had elevated the issue of climate change seeking to curb agricultural emissions as well as help farmers adapt to changing conditions by creating regional  across the United States Then-Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack sought to enlist farmers ranchers and forest owners in the effort to capture and store carbon nationwide  Since Trump took office the agency has shifted the description of some of these efforts On Wednesday for example the departmentsNational Institute of Food and Agriculture announced nine grants totaling more than $8 million to study and develop new approaches for the agriculture sector to adapt to and mitigate the effects of changing environmental conditions But the same press release noted that four of them were directed toward climate outreach and extension and another five were focused on climate and land useClovis an Iowa political activist who ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate in 2014 has emphasized his military and foreign policy experiencein the past During the 2016 presidential race and other mattersIn the2014 Iowa Public Radio Interview Clovis outlined his credentials for public serviceI think that if you look at my experience  25 years in the military and the various jobs and opportunities I had while serving the nation my experience as a business man and my academic preparation  my experience in a variety of other fields including homeland security foreign policy national security policy creating jobs and all those things Clovis saidThe White House announcement of his nomination emphasizes his military background noting After graduating from the [US Air Force] Academy Mr Clovis spent 25 years serving in the Air Force He retired as the Inspector General of the North American Aerospace Defense Command and the United States Space Command and was a command pilotThe position for which Clovis has been appointed ranks among themost critical science and technology roles in the federal government  a 2008 report by the National Academy of Sciences The position requires Senate confirmationThe Trump administration has been slow to fill top Senate-confirmed science jobs  only 10 out of 45 across the government had a nominee prior to the Clovis appointment  a Post analysis that is based on that same NAS report Clovis makes 11President-elect Donald Trump will retain ownership of his company while shifting assets into a trust managed by his sons a step that Trump and his advisers said will eliminate potential conflicts of interest between his public duties and private businessThe move announced Wednesday in Trumps first news conference since July followed weeks of criticism from ethics experts and congressional Democrats who have said his financial entanglements could improperly steer his presidential decision-makingThe announcement included a pledge from a Trump lawyer that the company would make no new foreign deals whatsoever during Trumps presidency and that any new domestic deals would undergo vigorous review including approval by an independent ethics adviserIn addition Trump is giving up his position as an officer at the company the Trump Organization ceding all management responsibilities and agreeing to what his lawyers described as strict limits on communications with company executives beyond receiving regular profit-and-loss statementsSheri Dillon a tax adviser at global law firm Morgan Lewis said Trump has sought to isolate himself from the business that will be managed by Trumps sons Donald Jr and Eric and company executive Allen WeisselbergTrump she said will only know of a deal if he sees it in the paper or on TV She added that Trump also terminated all pending international dealsBut Trumps continued financial stake in a global real estate and branding company is likely to remain a point of contention between the president-elect and federal ethics officials who have said that full divestiture remains the only way to prevent conflictsDillon who also wrote a widely shared letter last year that asserted Trumps tax returns were under audit argued that taking steps recommended by some vocal ethics experts would trigger additional problems A sell-off would have created additional conflicts she said while a blind trust would have been unrealistic for a real estate company with high-profile assetsPresident Trump cant unknow he owns Trump Tower Dillon said and he should not be expected to destroy the company he builtThe announcement inspired an unusual and highly critical response from the top federal official at the agency that works closely with presidential transition teams to ensure they abide by ethics requirementsWalter Shaub director of the Office of Government Ethics took the stage at a Wednesday event for the Brookings Institution think tank to say that Trumps decision doesnt meet the standards  that every president of the past four decades has metShaub appointed by President Obama in 2013 said the trust adds nothing to the equation because its not even close to a blind trust and called other Trump provisions wholly inadequateShaub whose agency administers financial disclosure filings and advises executive branch officials on avoiding conflicts of interest does not have the power to force Trumps hand The director said he spoke out in hopes the president-elect would fully divestSome ethics experts also expressed alarm Wednesday that the changes leave plenty of room for foreign interests and others to enrich the president and affect US policyRichard Painter who was ethics counsel in the George W Bush White House said the setup will not prevent Trump from knowing his business sources of revenue or block him from receiving income from the trust Trump Tower projects still stand for instance in the Philippines Turkey Uruguay and other hot spots where foreign buyers or governments could still lavish money on the Trump brandHe still has businesses all over the world and we still do not know who is financing those businesses and who hes indebted to Painter saidReferring to the yet-unnamed expert who would be hired to sign off on new deals Painter added That ethics adviser is going to have a lot of work to do Sounds like hell need air supportTrump also retained his ownership share of the luxury hotel he opened last year in the Old Post Office Pavilion down the street from the White House despite criticism that foreign leaders might try to curry favor with the administration by doing business there and at his other hotels possibly violating the Constitutions emoluments clauseThe clause has never been tested in the courts but it is upheld by threat of impeachment and some scholars say Trump risks violating it the day hes sworn into office The Washington hotel of which Trump owns 76percent has been frequented by foreign diplomats since the election Trump himself has signed for hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate loans from foreign banks and is currently involved in deals with foreign investors across several continentsDillon Trumps attorney dismissed the suggestion of a problem saying the clause would not apply to arms-length transactions the president-elect has nothing to do with such as hotel stays for foreign diplomatsNevertheless Dillon said the hotel would donate all profits from foreign government payments from the Trump International Hotel to the US TreasuryIn his news conference Wednesday at Trump Tower in Manhattan Trump showcased his signature theatrics He stood by several stacks of what he said were legal papers related to the Trump Organization changes He noted repeatedly that the president is not covered by any conflict-of-interest laws and that he was sure he could do a good job leading both the company and the country if he so choseI could actually run my business and run government at the same time he said But he added later I dont want to take advantage of something I have something that others dont haveAnd if his sons do a bad job Trump added he will tell them his catchphrase from The Apprentice Youre firedTrump said his commitment to focus on the presidency has already cost him business adding he had in recent days turned down $2billion to do a number of deals in Dubai with Hussain Sajwani the billionaire chairman of the Damac Properties development firm and a man Trump has called a friendA Damac executive said the company confirms that the discussions took place as stated in the media briefing but the proposals were declined by the Trump Organization and that the proposals were for a variety of different property dealsTrumps plan will also include tapping a chief compliance counsel at the Trump Organization who will monitor the Trump businesses for any actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency Dillon saidNeither Trump nor Dillon said who would fill the position and requests to speak with company representatives were not immediately returnedThe Trump Organization is a vast worldwide collection of golf courses hotels condo towers and other commercial holdings spread across more than 500 business interests financial filings showMuch of the companys revenue stems from deals with real estate developers and merchandisers who pay the company millions of dollars to use Trumps name and imagePresidents are exempt from conflict-of-interest laws that force virtually all other executive-branch officials to sell off their business interests as well as recuse themselves from public decision-making that could benefit their private finances The president must still abide by bribery fraud and corruption laws that could arise from potential financial conflictsModern presidents have followed a tradition of selling potentially problematic assets or sequestering them into a blind trust overseen by an independent manager with unassailable controlThe trust agreement outlined Wednesday will not be truly blind critics said due to Trumps family relationship to its leaders his sonsTrumps daughter Ivanka will also step down from management of the Trump Organization and her name-brand fashion jewelry and licensing companies lawyers said She will also restructure her involvement in potentially profitable Trump Organization deals and instead receive fixed payments from the revenue of what lawyers called a diversified pool of unidentified projectsFixed-income agreements are common approaches to addressing conflicts for spouses of those stepping into government But like her father Ivanka Trump has not committed to selling off her ownership stake leaving one of her largest conflicts unresolvedIvanka Trumps husband Jared Kushner who Trump will name as a White House adviser will sell off much of his New York real estate and media fortune and resign from the family business to avoid conflicts his lawyers said this weekMany questions remain Trump has not released his income tax returns which would give the most precise look yet at Trumps holdings business interests and foreign accounts Trump has blamed several years of Internal Revenue Service audits among other factors for his reluctance to release the returns Presidents by law are audited every year and not required to release their returns Trumps sons too have already run into the minefield of potential conflicts awaiting the presidents family Eric Trump said recently that he will leave his foundation following worries that donors could receive special access or favors from the Trump administrationCongressional Democrats on Monday introduced a law that would force Trump and future presidents to divest their business interests and other potential conflicts But their Republican counterparts have largely stayed silent on Trumps entanglements or said they trust his judgment drawing the laws success into question Jonathan OConnell contributed to this reportClose observers of the 2016 election will remember that on occasion President Trump liked to draw attention to his opponents security practices as a way of criticism There was you may recall something about an email serverHillary Clinton  sent classified information even during her travels overseas jeopardizing the national security of the American people by allowing her emails to be hacked by foreign intelligence services Trumps campaign  declared But it wasnt just Clinton who was the target of his criticism The Democratic National Committee got hacked because it didnt have a very strong defense system against hacking the way the Republicans did (as he said during a cybersecurity session on Jan 31) The government was hacked by China because were run by people that dont know what theyre doing (as said in his Jan 11 news conference) Trump the idea went would not be so naive on the critical subject of national securityPerhaps its harder than it looksSunday night CNN  details of the moment that Trump joined by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe learned about a missile launch in North Korea Trump and Abe were enjoying dinner at Trumps exclusive Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida at the time but CNN reported began to discuss the details of this international incident right there at their table  As Mar-a-Lagos wealthy members looked on from their tables and with a keyboard player crooning in the background CNNs Kevin Liptak reported Trump and Abes evening meal quickly morphed into a strategy session the decision-making on full view to fellow diners who described it in detail to CNNEarlier in the week Trump had been criticized for leaving intelligence documents vulnerable to people without security clearance Sen Martin Heinrich (D-NM) noticed that the president kept the key in a secured bag while hosting people in the Oval Office which is a bit like leaving your house keys in your front door while youre having a party in your backyard Theres no indication that anyone saw anything confidential in this incident but this Heinrich suggested was Classified 101Never leave a key in a classified lockbag in the presence of non-cleared people  (Original Photo  )  Martin Heinrich (@MartinHeinrich) Compared to holding a national security conversation over dinner in the public dining room at his private club though the lockbag incident palesIts not clear that anyone heard particulars of the conversation but other diners certainly noticed Richard DeAgazio was in the room and posted photos of the moment to FacebookOthers who were there added their thoughts in the comments beneath the post One wrote that he was watching very close by Had no idea what it was about Thats probably not the case for the waiters who CNN reports cleared the wedge salads and brought along the main course as Trump and Abe continued consulting with aidesNotice though that the photos appear to corroborate an important detail from the CNN report The patio was lit only with candles and moonlight so aides used the camera lights on their phones to help the stone-faced Trump and Abe read through the documents Liptak writes In DeAgazios first photo you can see a phone flashlight being used in that wayWhy is this important Mobile phones have flashlights yes  and cameras microphones and Internet connectivity When Edward Snowden was meeting with reporters in Hong Kong at the moment he was leaking the material hed stolen from the NSA he famously asked that they   blocking any radio signals in the event that the visitors phones had been hacked This was considered the most secure way of ensuring that the phones couldnt be used as wiretaps even more secure than removing the battery Phones  especially phones with their flashes turned on for improved visibility  are portable television satellite trucks and if compromised can be used to get a great deal of information about whats happening nearby unless precautions are taken  Precautions werent taken One of DeAgazios photos shows Trump using a phone at the table within view of other diners (and while sitting next to a foreign leader) Its not clear what phone Trump is using in that picture but its known that he uses a relatively old Android device even while serving as president As we  Trump generally uses that device when hes not in the middle of a work day Shortly before the dinner with Abe he tweeted from itA working dinner tonight with Prime Minister Abe of Japan and his representatives at the Winter White House (Mar-a-Lago) Very good talks Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) The problem is that Trumps Android phone would be very simple to hack to provide precisely the sort of access described above NPR  the question of how secure that phone might be and Berkeley computer scientist Nicholas Weaver was bluntDonald Trump for the longest time has been using a insecure Android phone that by all reports is so easy to compromise it would not meet the security requirements of a teenager Weaver told NPR and while he couldnt say for sure we must assume that his phone has actively been compromised for a while and an actively compromised phone is literally a listening deviceThats just one of the phones that may have been at the table for the conversationThe picture thats painted is one that runs contrary to the arguments Trump made on the campaign trail While running for the presidency cybersecurity and the risk of compromise were cardinal sins necessitating that he be given the most powerful position in America Now that hes attained that position though his attitude toward security seems a bit more laxSpicer also said with Mar A Lago this weekend President was briefed in a SCIF and dinner discussion was just logistics over a presser Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs)Debate intensified in President Trumps political circle Tuesday over how aggressively to confront special counsel Robert S Mueller III dividing some of the presidents advisers and loyalists as the Russia investigation enters a new phase following charges against three former Trump campaign officialsDespite his  with a  he has roundly dismissed Trump has been cooperating with Mueller and lately has resisted attacking him directly at the  inside and outside the White HouseBut several prominent Trump allies including former White House chief strategist Stephen K Bannon have said they think the presidents posture is too timid Seeing the investigation as a political threat they are clamoring for a more combative approach to Mueller that would damage his credibility and effectively kneecap his operation by cutting its fundingStill Bannon and others are not advising Trump to fire Mueller a rash move that the presidents lawyers and political advisers oppose and insist is not under considerationBannon in recent days has spoken with Trump by phone to relay his concerns about the presidents position and to counsel a shift in strategy according to three people with knowledge of the conversation The president  so far  has not accepted Bannons advice these people saidBannons view has been amplified elsewhere on the right with talk radio and cable news commentators speaking out more forcefully against Mueller and his expanding probe The Wall Street Journal  has called on Mueller to resign The Journal is part of News Corp which is led by Rupert Murdoch a friend of Trump who speaks privately with the presidentBut many people in Trumps orbit recommend that he stay the course with cooperation  encouraging him to harshly criticize media coverage of the investigation but avoid engaging MuellerI like Steve but his advice is not always the most helpful said Christopher Ruddy a Trump friend and the chief executive of Newsmax a conservative media outlet In this case whatever Steve says the president should do the opposite  The  where Republican lawmakers have mostly split into two camps those who are wary of weighing in on Muellers investigation and those who see it as a prime political targetBannon is demanding that GOP leaders move swiftly to end congressional probes into Russian interference undermine Muellers investigation and increase scrutiny on Democratic controversiesThe Republicans are like church mice Bannon said Tuesday No support of the president Totally gutless The Hill needs to step upSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E Grassley (R-Iowa) said he believes that Republicans should proceed carefully and he called Mueller a very ethical personI dont know how you could improve things by interfering Grassley said The process just ought to goHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif) a trusted Trump ally has launched an investigation into  and is preparing to invite witnesses this week to testify about the FBIs handling of Russia investigations Nunes intends to issue subpoenas if people decline to appear according to people briefed on his plansFormer House speaker Newt Gingrich an informal Trump adviser who praised Mueller earlier this year after his appointment as special counsel said he has slowly soured on the former FBI director and agrees that Congress should put a harsher national spotlight on himMueller ought to be held accountable Gingrich saidHe ticked through a series of what he considers questionable moves by Mueller and his team including their handling of former Trump foreign policy adviser  whom the government described in an indictment unsealed Monday as a proactive cooperatorCongress should look seriously at whether Mueller put a wire on this guy and sent him around to entrap people Gingrich said If that happened Congress better see the full transcripts not just the FBIs edited versions Congress should also ask why theyre  [former campaign chairman Paul] Manaforts home at 5 am for a white-collar crime from a few years agoThis sentiment is not heard at the White House however where officials have been careful not to antagonize the special counselOur approach has been to be cooperative and responsive and to see this come to a quick conclusion White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Have we been aggressive in our comments and our feelings towards the Clinton campaign and the DNC Yes But thats where our aggression is seen and nowhere elseTy Cobb the White House lawyer overseeing Russia matters said after Mondays indictments of Manafort and his longtime deputy Rick Gates Nothing about todays events alters anything related to our engagement with the special counsel with whom we continue to cooperateCobb added There are no discussions and there is no consideration being given to terminating MuellerRepublicans in Congress said Trump is wise to avoid messing with MuellerThere would be an uprising at the Capitol like never seen before if any kind of interference looked like it was taking place said Sen Bob Corker (R-Tenn) Regardless of which side of the aisle Thats just beyond the pale  Among Republicans there is broad agreement to bring attention to past controversies involving Hillary Clinton Trumps Democratic opponent in the 2016 election that have animated hourly discussions on Fox News Channel and conservative talk radio programsThe White House and allies have waged a public relations battle over the Clinton campaigns and the Democratic National Committees  that resulted in the famous dossier that details Trumps alleged connections to RussiaThe dossier has become a lightning rod with congressional Republican leaders trying to discredit Fusion GPS the firm that commissioned the dossier and the documents author Christopher Steele a former British intelligence officer with ties to the US intelligence communityRepublicans also are trying to bring scrutiny to  while Clinton was secretary of state The deal  which Trump used as a political cudgel against Clinton during the campaign  allowed a Russian nuclear energy agency to acquire a controlling stake in a Canadian-based company that had mining licenses for about 20 percent of US uranium extraction capacity although the company cannot export uraniumFox News Channel host Sean Hannity a Trump confidant decried the lack of investigative attention on Clinton a point the president and his top aides have made in recent daysThis is not hyperbole Hannity said Monday night in his  which the president is known to watch regularly I am not overstating the case We are at a major crisis point in America tonight Do we have equal justice under the law in this country todaySome Republican lawmakers have heeded these calls House and Senate GOP leaders have announced two investigations into the uranium deal while at least three congressional committees are continuing to look into how the FBI handled Clintons email scandalBut there appears to be little appetite for legislation that would cut Muellers funding or otherwise limit the scope of his investigation something various Trump allies have suggested is necessaryMy basic philosophy is once you have an independent counsel you ought to give him a chance to follow the facts said Sen Richard C Shelby (R-Ala) a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the chairman of the subcommittee that handles the Justice Departments funding If somebodys doing a job you dont want to cut it offSen Susan Collins (R-Maine) said The idea that Bob Mueller is going to have the scope of his inquiry constrained or be otherwise restricted is really out there I think thats extremely unlikely Karoun Demirjian and Sean Sullivan contributed to this reportPresident Trump on Thursday aired his grievances against the news media the intelligence community and his detractors generally in a sprawling stream-of-consciousness news conference that alternated between claims that he had inherited a mess and the assertion that his fledgling administration is running like a fine-tuned machineTo be honest I inherited a mess Trump said in a news conference that lasted more thanan hour and was at times rambling combative and pointed Its a mess At home and abroad a mess Jobs are pouring out of the countryYet moments later the president seemed to acknowledge the widespread reports of turbulence and upheaval emanating out of his West Wing only to claim that his White House  which so far has been marred by staff infighting a controversial travel ban false statements and myriad leaks  was operating seamlesslyI turn on the TV open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos  chaos he said Yet it is the exact opposite This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine despite the fact that I cant get my Cabinet approvedAsked about recent reports that Mike Flynn his former national security adviser who resigned Monday evening had improperly discussed Russian sanctions with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump was sworn in the president defended Flynn as a fine person saying he had done nothing wrong in engaging the Russian envoyBut Trump said Flynn had erred by misleading government officials including Vice President Pence about his conversations which is why the president ultimately demanded his resignationHe didnt tell the vice president of the United States the facts Trump said And then he didnt remember And that just wasnt acceptable to meTrump made clear he had no problem with Flynn discussing the sanctions imposed on Moscow by the Obama administration with the Russian ambassador even if he was not directly toldto do so by Trump saying it was Flynnsjob to reach out to foreign officialsNo I didnt direct him but I would have directed him if he didnt do it he saidTrump was asked several times about whether his campaign had contact with Russia and grew testy as reporters pushed him for a yes-or-no answerHe said he certainly hadnt and that he was not aware of such contacts during the campaignI can tell you speaking for myself I own nothing in Russia Trump said I have no loans in Russia I dont have any deals in Russia President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election He then called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration which was terrific But so did many other leaders almost all other leaders from almost all of the countries So thats the extentTrump also used the questions to press his case that the United States would be well-served by a better relationship with Russia and to mock his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for her efforts to reset the relationship between the two countries while she was secretary of stateTrump derisively referred to that stupid plastic button that made us all look like jerks a reference to the red reset button that Clinton presented to the Russian foreign minister early in the Obama administrationThe news conference was ostensibly billed as a chance for Trump to announce his new pick to head the Labor Department  Alexander Acosta who would be the first Latino in Trumps Cabinet  after Andrew Puzder his original choice withdrew from consideration Wednesday amid mounting opposition on Capitol Hill But for onehour and 17 minutes the president offered the verbal equivalent of the brash and impetuous early morning tweets that have become the alarm clock for much of Washington taking aim at everything from illegal immigrant violence to the criminal leaks within his intelligence communityTrump said he would use his remarks to bypass the dishonest media and speak directly to the American people about the incredible progress his administration has madeThe media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges we made and theyre not happy about it for whatever reason he saidThough the president began on a subdued almost melancholy note looking down repeatedly to read from prepared remarks on his lectern he became more fiery and animated  joyful even  when he began to banter and joust with the assembled reporters At times he seemed to reprise some of his favorite themes from the campaign trail complaining about Clinton and criticizing President Barack Obamas policies from his Affordable Care Act to his failed reset with RussiaTrump repeatedly lambasted the fake news media  which at one point he upgraded (or downgraded) to the very fake news media  while promoting some dubious claims and fake news of his ownPressed on his incorrect assertion that he had the largest margin of victory in the electoral college since President Ronald Reagan Trump blamed faulty factsI was given that information he said Well I dont know I was given that informationOn a substantive note Trump said his administration would submit a replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act in early to mid-March and should have a tax reform package around the same timeTax reform is going to happen fairly quickly Trump said Were doing Obamacare Were in final stagesDuring the news conference Trump alternated between showering the media with scorn and taking a more playful toneAt one point he insisted he was enjoying himself Im not ranting and raving  I love this he said Im having a good time doing thisTrumps Thursday performance seemed an acknowledgment by the president that he may be his own best press secretary and adviser and allowed him to appear both confident and comfortable While many of his comments as well as the sometimes disjointed nature of his delivery are certain to alarm official Washington they are also the sorts of red-meat talking points that delighted his base during the campaign and helped propel him to victoryI won with news conferences and probably speeches he told the assembled reporters I certainly didnt win by people listening to you peoplePresident Trumpsought Monday to distance himself from the federal money-laundering charges againsttwo of his top campaign aidesPaul Manafort and Rick Gates by saying their alleged conspiracy occurred years ago and asserting that there is NO COLLUSIONThe first White House comment aboutMondays 12-count indictment came in a pair of tweets from the president who continued his days-long drum beatto ratchet up pressure on his former foe Hillary Clinton and the DemocratsTrump tweeted Sorry but this is years ago before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign But why arent Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focusIn a second tweet sent three minutes later Trump wrote   Also there is NO COLLUSIONSorry but this is years ago before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign But why arent Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Also there is NO COLLUSION Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) While the charges did not reference Manafort and Gatess work on the Trump campaignseparate court documents unsealed Mondaydetailed connections betweenthe Trump campaign and the Russian government Those documents show that George Papadopoulos a foreign policy adviser to Trumps campaign pleaded guilty tomaking a false statement tothe FBI about his contacts with a foreign professor connected to Russian officialsManafort who served as Trumps campaign chairman for several months in mid-2016 and Gates who was Manaforts top deputy on the campaign were longtime business partners and were charged Monday with conspiracy to launder money making false statements and other counts stemming from special counsel Robert S Mueller IIIs investigation into Russias influence in the 2016 election and possible coordination with the Trump campaign  The chargesagainst Manafort and Gates focused on their years of lucrative work advising foreign governments and political parties including a party in Ukraine closely aligned with Russian President Vladimir PutinOver the weekend as Washington braced for the first batch of indictments from Muellers investigation Trump sought to shift attention from his campaign and associates to his former opponent Clinton In Twitter outbursts amplified by Trump allies the president said the Mueller probe was unfair and demanded that investigations be launched into various Clinton controversies  There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton and now the facts are pouring out DO SOMETHING Trump wrote in one tweetLater in the morning Trump added All of this Russia talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts & Reform Is this coincidental NOTDonald Trumps adult sons who are overseeing a nationwide expansion of the family business during their fathers presidency are envisioning ways that their experiences from the campaign trail can help them establish a footing in dozens of new marketsThe idea is to move beyond a focus on luxury hotels in big metropolises and build boutique properties in a broader mix of cities including some the Trump brothers came to know well during more than a year of intensive travel fundraising and grass-roots networking on the road to the White HouseI got to see a lot of those markets on the campaign Donald Trump Jr the presidents eldest son told The Washington Post in a recent interview from his office on the 25th floor of Trump Tower I think Ive probably been in all of them over the last 18 monthsThe initial plan is tied to the Trumps previously announced new chain Scion which is being designed as a less-corporate feeling brand of high-end hotels with a more affordable per-room price point than the Trumps five-star properties As with many existing Trump-branded property deals the developers would own the hotels while the Trumps would be paid licensing and management feesThe company says it has signed at least 17 letters of intent with potential developers It is targeting an array of cities such as Austin Dallas St Louis Nashville and Seattle  and Trump Jr said the campaign proved useful in forging relationships with potential new connectionsI met people along the way that would be awesome partners he saidThe expansion plan illustrates how President Trumps political rise has the potential to affect his business even as he and his sons promise to adhere to a strict ethical boundary between the companys moves and the Trump administration And it shows the inherent challenge in separating the familys political work from its corporate interests with upsides and potential problemsExtending the Trump business into a greater cluster of American cities could bring political benefits for a president who has vowed to bring jobs and economic prosperity to struggling communities But it also comes as Trump has faced criticism from Democrats and ethics officials for his decision to retain his ownership stake in the company a decision that means he stands to personally benefit from its growthBuilding new hotels for example could create issues  tax disputes allegations of labor violations or environmental violations  that require federal departments to consider cases that could directly impact the presidents finances And while the Trumps have vowed to sign no new foreign deals pursuing a raft of new domestic contracts from coast to coast means the Trumps are likely to engage in negotiations with private developers banks and investors who see additional benefits in doing business with the presidents companyIts just going to add fuel to the fire that is already burning  with him having still a foot in both the boardroom and one in the Oval Office said Scott Amey the general counsel of the nonpartisan watchdog group Project on Government OversightThe White House did not respond to a request for comment The president in January added a team of ethics lawyers to the White House Counsels Office while the company hired a longtime Republican attorney tasked with ensuring the Trump Organization minimizes conflicts of interestIn interviews the Trump sons waved off the idea that their plans created any potential ethical problemsThere are lines that we would never cross and thats mixing business with anything government Eric Trump saidDonald Trump Jr said that since the inauguration he has spoken with his father twice on the phone and once in person  when he and his brother attended the announcement of their fathers Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch Eric Trump said he may ask his father how things are in the White House but would never discuss government or business affairsWill we ever talk about tax policy Will I ever ask for anything that could otherwise benefit the business Absolutely emphatically not Eric Trump said He has no need to know what were doing and I certainly dont need to know what theyre doing and I dont want toThe Trumps point man on the expansion is Eric Danziger an experienced executive who was hired in 2015 after previously overseeing expansions at Carlson Hotels Worldwide Starwood Hotels and the former Wyndham InternationalOne of the first Scion projects is slated to open in Dallas where a Turkish-born developer aims to open a sleek glass six-story hotel as part of a $50million mixed-use downtown development The Austin Cincinnati Denver Detroit Nashville Seattle and St Louis areas are also possible targets according to reports by Bloomberg News and business trade publicationsThe Trumps declined to say what other cities they were exploring for projects but said they were actively seeking contracts in many placesDanziger speaking last month to Skift an industry publication called Scion a four-star lifestyle brand with wide geographic appealThat kind of brand can be in every city  tertiary secondary he said So how many is that The opportunity is for hundredsBecause of the prohibition on foreign deals Danziger said the company is going to have full focus  instead of some focus  on growth domestically of both Trump and Scion The expansion will not be easy according to analysts The Trumps will be entering a crowded marketplace of new hotel lines from Marriott Hilton and Hyatt designed to appeal to a broad cross-section of customers said Michael J Bellisario a senior research analyst with the firm Robert W Baird & CoThere are so many more competitors out there today Bellisario saidFor the Trumps to distinguish their projects from their competitors they will need to be choosy about locations Bellisario said Youve got to be on the right street corner in the right market You cant open these hotels in Topeka Kansas he said So when you think about that how big can the new line getThe plan is a big test for the younger TrumpsJust as Donald Trump stepped out from his fathers shadow in the 1970s to build the family real estate business into todays worldwide collection of golf courses hotels condo towers branded merchandise and other commercial holdings now Donald Trump Jr 39 and Eric Trump 33 have a chance to make their mark  Along with their sister Ivanka who departed the company when their father entered office the brothers have long served as executive vice presidentsBefore their father ran for president the three siblings helped expand the firm from focusing on New York to including the management of luxury hotels in top US cities and seven countries plus more than a dozen golf coursesThe fruits of that work are still coming as last month the company opened a new golf club in Dubai and last week held a grand opening for a new hotel-condominium tower in Vancouver BCA major transition for the sons is taking over a company in which the force behind every Trump company offering  whether it was selling hotel rooms office buildings golf outings ties or raw steaks  was Donald Trump himselfIn interviews Trump Jr and Eric Trump said they consider themselves protectors of the Trump brand an effort they said is sometimes misunderstood Critics viewed the announcement of Scion during the campaign as a move away from the Trump name The familys intent was the opposite since they view the name Trump has a standard for luxury that ought to be insulated they will use other brands for less pricey productsWe would never want to dilute the real estate brand by going into tertiary markets that cant sustain the [luxury] properties as we build them Eric Trump said A lot of hotel companies have gotten this wrongBoth sons worked for their father starting at young ages doing landscaping and other labor on his projectsA University of Pennsylvania graduate Trump Jrs first assignment at the company was to work with executives at New York City real estate projectsEric Trump joined after graduating from Georgetown in 2006 He has overseen the Trump Winery near Charlottesville and worked on the Trump hotel in Las Vegas where he developed a reputation as a hands-on executiveIf theres a property tax issue or any litigation he flies into Las Vegas and takes care of it said Phil Ruffin a casino mogul who is the Trumps partner in the Las Vegas project He hires the lawyer If there are any capital improvements he approves them He is very energetic like his father  he will just work night and dayWith their father in charge there was an informal division of labor among his three eldest children governing which projects each swooped in to helpIvanka Trump created her own brands of shoes jewelry handbags and coats She took the lead on some of the Trump Organizations most prominent recent projects such as the $212million DC hotel which had its soft opening in SeptemberIm probably the most obviously like [Trump Sr] Ivanka Trump said in a 2011 company video titled Trump The Next GenerationIn certain ways she added Eric is very similar to him in terms of his love of construction and building And Don has his sense of humorThe Trumps planned corporate expansion comes as the president has faced intense criticism from Democrats and ethics experts for his continued ownership interestA liberal watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) has sued Trump arguing that his hotel operations violate a constitutional provision barring the president from accepting gifts or payments from a foreign government Some Democrats have argued that Trumps international trademarks including one long-sought registration granted in February by China also violate the Constitutions emoluments clauseTrump has called the CREW lawsuit totally without meritAmey of the Project on Government Oversight said there were ways for the Trumps to avoid potential domestic conflicts related to the hotel expansion He said they could put the hotel business under another corporate structure which does not involve a trust directly owned by the president himselfThere are solutions to solving this [but] there doesnt seem to be a will and a desire to do that within the White House Amey saidThe Trump brothers say they are taking ethics concerns seriously and are doing everything necessary to avoid distracting from their fathers work as presidentHave I used him as a sounding board in the past Onehundred percent Trump Jr said Have I learned a lot from him Couldnt have had a better mentor But hes got real stuff hes got to deal with These are real peoples lives  So this notion that he is still running the business from the White House is just insaneTrump Jr scoffed at the idea that his father might have somehow viewed running for president  spending millions of dollars of his own money to run against more than a dozen Republican challengers and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton when few pundits gave him a chance to win  as a moneymaking endeavorThats not a get-rich-quick scheme he said That doesnt make any sense whatsoeverPresident Trump suggested Thursday that the FBI may have had a hand in creating an intelligence dossier that alleged ties between Russia and Trumps presidential campaignWorkers of firm involved with the discredited and Fake Dossier take the 5th Who paid for it Russia the FBI or the Dems (or all) Trump wrote on TwitterThe compendium of information about Trump much of it unproven was produced by a former British intelligence agent last year mostly before Trump won the 2016 election Officials have said the FBI has confirmed some of the information and rejected other parts and caution that it may be impossible to verify or disprove the rest Trump has vigorously denied allegations in the document that the Russian government has collected compromising information about him and was engaged in an active effort to assist his campaignThe Washington Post has previously reported that the FBI agreed in October 2016 to pay the dossiers author Christopher Steele for further work that might help its own investigation into Russian election activitiesThe FBI as well as the Senate Intelligence Committee is investigating Russian interference in the election and alleged contacts between Trumps associates and the KremlinAs the allegations contained in the dossier began appearing in news stories and the dossier itself became the subject of intense public debate Steele became a publicly known figure and the FBI did not pursue further work from him The Post reported in February  Trumps Twitter question about whether the FBI may have paid for the document suggests that he is asking whether the bureau had been involved earlier in the process although his precise meaning is unclearAn FBI spokesman declined to commentRepublicans particularly Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles E Grassley (Iowa) have sought further answers from the FBI about its relationship with Steele and its plan to pay him for information that could incriminate Trump or his associatesIt is not uncommon for the FBI to pay sources of information and Steele was well known to the FBI Previously Steele had helped the FBI put together a sprawling global bribery case involving FIFA the governing body of world soccerWhen Steele started compiling the dossier in 2016 he was doing so for a Washington firm called Fusion GPS The firm began researching Trump first for an unidentified GOP donor and then later for DemocratsRepublican lawmakers have been pressing Fusion GPS for months to identify those who paid for Steeles work but the firm has refused Fusion GPS says that it has promised confidentiality to its clients and that violating that obligation would harm its business modelOn Wednesday a lawyer for Fusion GPS said the firms employees refused to testify in response to a subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee invoking their constitutional privilege not to do so The firms founder Glenn Simpson had previously given a 10-hour interview to the Senate Judiciary CommitteeThe dossier alleged among other things that associates of Trump colluded with the Kremlin on cyberattacks on DemocratsTrump said Monday that there was no collusion with Russia and that special counsel Robert S Mueller IIIs investigation into Russian election activities should conclude quickly Muellers probe however is broader than just the collusion inquestSteele began his Trump investigation in June 2016 after working for another client preparing a report on Russian efforts to interfere with politics in EuropeUS intelligence had been independently tracking Russian efforts to influence electoral outcomes in EuropeRussian regime has been cultivating supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years Steele wrote that JuneSteeles information was provided by an intermediary to the FBI and US intelligence officials after the Democratic National Convention in July 2016 when hacked Democratic emails were first released by WikiLeaks according to a source familiar with the events After the convention Steele contacted a friend in the FBI to personally explain what he had foundBefore Donald Trump proposed a 1000-mile wall on the US-Mexico border to stop migrants he tried to build a two-mile barrier on a pristine stretch of Irish coast to rein in an oceanHe didnt succeedIrish surfers weekend beachcombers environmental scientists local planners and even a microscopic snail got in his way In December Trump International Golf Links backed down from plans it had said were essential to protect the companys lone Irish course  picturesquely nestled in dunes overlooking the Atlantic  from being swallowed by rising seasFor a man who loves to win the defeat  just a month after his election as president  has left a bitter taste And despite the motley nature of the resistance Trump seems to have singled out a lone culprit the European Union whose rules and regulations underpinned many of the objectionsIn interviews and public statements Trump has cited his tangle over the golf-course wall as Exhibit A in justifying a jaundiced view of the EU that puts him at odds with decades of bipartisan US foreign policyPrevious presidents  Democrats and Republicans alike  have seen the EU as an essential partner in global stability and a bulwark against the self-interested nationalism that spawned two world wars To Trump the blocs environmental protection regulations were a threat to his exquisitely manicured fairways and putting greensI found it to be a very unpleasant experience he told British and German interviewers last month after bringing up the wall dispute unbidden when asked his opinion of the EUA bad experience he emphasized weeks later as he raised the issue at his first White House news conferenceThe bureaucratic battle over a golf-course sea wall makes for an unlikely inflection point in geopolitical history And yet in Europe Trumps hostility toward the union that backers credit with keeping decades of continental peace is seen as a potentially fatal blowEuropean Council President Donald Tusk recently took the extraordinary step of including Trump on alist of threats to the already teetering EU right alongside China Russia and radical Islam  The golf-course dispute of course is not the only explanation for Trumps disdain He has also criticized the EUs status as a trading rival to the United States the predominance within the bloc of German interests and its suppression of national identitiesBut that a relatively minor spat at a golf course has any bearing on such a major foreign policy stance is baffling to some of those who battled the wall  especially they say because Trump has his facts wrongHe speaks as though it was the EU that stopped it It wasnt said Dave Flynn co-chair of a local surfers group that opposed the sea barrier Its amazing that such a big foreign policy decision like this could be made on such an ill-informed basisThe 18-hole golf resort in the west Irish village of Doonbeg is a relatively small and recent addition to Trumps global business empire which he signed over to his sons just before entering the White HouseIronically the resort was originally built with the help of a $4million grant from the EU The money was intended to spur rural development And for a time it did drawing international tourists and more than 200 jobs to a village where cattle farming fishing and a handful of pubs had been the mainstays of the local economyBut by early 2014 just over a decade after opening the resort was struggling battered by the one-two punch of an Irish economy still reeling from the global downturn and severe winter storms that left the course badly damagedTrumps company swooped in and bought it at a deep discount  reportedly for about $15millionThat spring Trump paid his new asset a visit At nearby Shannon Airport he was given a red-carpet welcome complete with a harpist and a handshake from the Irish finance minister In a radio interview he said he would invest about $45million in a dramatic upgrade and expansion of the resorts facilitiesBut as storms continued to pound away at the greens it became apparent that any investment would come to naught unless the fragile and ever-shifting dunes upon which the course is built were better defendedInitially the companys solution was to begin dumping piles of rock along the beach But the work lacked the necessary permits from County Clare and was haltedUltimately Trump International put an audacious plan before the county council a two-mile 200000-ton 15-foot-high rock wall that would sharply divide the dunes from the adjacent Doughmore BeachIt was a quantum leap from anything we had seen Flynn said It was big and brash just hugely shockingFlynn who works as a development manager said that he has been surfing at Doughmore for more than 20 years The wide sandy half-moon beach is regarded as the best surf spot in western Ireland he said During the spring summer and autumn its perfect It just tracks in wavesHe and fellow club members quickly concluded that Trumps wall would destroy their meccaNature doesnt like hard lines he said The beach will erode at the front and the dunes will die at the back They need to work togetherResidents of Doonbeg a tiny verdant and windswept village on the Atlantic coast took a different view Trump International said it needed the wall to keep the resort open With course visitors pumping money into the economy locals rallied around Trump Internationals plan  The scenery is beautiful here but you cant eat it You need to build in order to survive and thrive said Rita McInerney who owns a local cafe and general store and whose family has been in Doonbeg for seven generations Some people think were selling our souls by dealing with Trump International But prospects are few and far between in an area like this And the fact is its 200 jobs plus the spinoff for local businessesCoincidentally Vice President Pence has ancestors who hail from Doonbeg which has also helped to consolidate local supportTrump has kept the jobs here and kept the tourists coming in He made a promise to the people of Doonbeg and he made good on it said Hugh McNally a local restaurant owner and Pences third cousinMcNally said that much of the opposition to the wall was generated based on political opposition to Trump and that it came from outside the villageOpponents acknowledge their outsider status but insist the objections they lodged with county planners are based on genuine concern for an important natural habitat Some of the legal objections though not all were based on the sites EU designation as a special area of conservation and a habitat for the narrow-mouthed whorl snail  a rare and protected speciesIf you damage the dunes then you eventually eliminate the snails habitat said Tony Lowes director of Friends of the Irish Environment They will go if a wall is put in placeTrump has fumed at such arguments calling them environmental tricks to stop a project from being built in an interview with the and Germanys BildHe also said his company had received the approvals very quickly from Ireland and then Ireland and my people went to the EU to get the approval It was going to take yearsThe reality however is that EU approval was never needed and Irish approval was never given The project was stalled at the county level  with planners weighing objections based on local national and EU law A petition at the national level was rejectedTrump encouraged Britain to leave the EU and has said he believes other members will follow After the Brexit vote last June he in a ribbon-cutting at one of his Scottish golf courses Turnberry saying the vote was a positive because it would depress the value of Britains currencyWhen the pound goes down he said more people are coming to TurnberryThats proved correct The course has seen an upturn in businessSo has Doonbeg with the course benefiting from what its general manager Joe Russell said is an investment of over $25million in upgrades since Trump International bought itBut the resort will not be getting the rock wall  at least not as originally planned Just weeks after Trumps victory in November the company withdrew its proposal rather than answer 51 questions posed by county planners Russell said the decision was made because approval would have taken years that the company does not haveInstead Trump International has proposed two smaller walls which together are less than a third the size of the original We hope [the new plan] will proceed through the planning process quicker Russell saidBut the battle continues Many of the same groups that opposed the original wall have objected to the new plan arguing that when the smaller barriers inevitably fail Trump International will be back demanding bigger onesSea walls Lowes said beget sea walls Karla Adam in London contributed to this reportIt was Saturday night and Palm Beachs tony Mar-a-Lago Club was packed There was a wedding reception in the ballroom There was a full house for dinner on the terraceAnd at one table on the terrace there was the president and the leader of a major US ally hashing out a national security problem in the open airSomeone opened up a laptop and at the table  a group of Japanese people stood around the prime minister and Donald and they were all looking at the laptop said Jay Weitzman a member of President Trumps Mar-a-Lago Club and founder of the Pennsylvania-based parking management company Park America He was sitting three tables away from Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Saturday eveningWhoa Weitzman remembered thinking Whats going onTurns out it was a missile launch he said MondayAs Weitzman and other patrons watched Saturday evening Trump and Abe remained at the table and discussed their response to a ballistic missile test by North Korea While waiters came and went  and while one club member snapped photos  the two leaders reviewed documents by the light of an aides cellphoneThat strange scene  in which Trump turned his table into an alfresco situation room  astounded White House veterans who were used to presidents retiring to private secured settings to hash out such an eventTrump became president in part because of Democrat Hillary Clintons neglect of information security During the 2016 campaign Trump repeatedly called for Clinton to be jailed  and his crowds at rallies often chanted Lock her up  for her use of a private email server to handle government business while she was secretary of state Now Trump is drawing fire from Democrats for his own seemingly loose attitude toward information security He has continued to use an insecure cellphone according to the New York Times He may have left a key to classified information on his desk while visitors were in the Oval Office according to a tweet from a Democratic senator And now Trump has used his bustling club in Palm Beach Fla as a winter White House except that unlike the actual White House the club is full of other people Sean Spicer the White House press secretary told reporters Monday that no classified material was shared at the table at Mar-a-Lago and that Trump had been briefed in a secure location both before and after dinnerThe scene was  On Monday Democrats blasted Trump for his handling of the momentTheres no excuse for letting an international crisis play out in front of a bunch of country club members like dinner theater Rep Nancy Pelosi (Calif) the leader of House Democrats wrote  Separately two Senate Democrats from the Homeland Security Committee Claire McCaskill (Mo) and Thomas R Carper (Del) wrote to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis who oversees the agency that protects the presidents communications McCaskill and Carper said they were concerned about media reports that Trump is still using his old Android phone to send Twitter messagesMcCaskill and Carper said that if a foreign power was able to hack that phone it could be turned into an always-on listening post in the presidents pocketThe national security risks of compromising a smartphone used by [the president] are considerable the senators wroteLast week Sen Martin Heinrich (D-NM) tweeted an Associated Press photo showing Trump with the chief executive of Intel standing by a stack of papers on Trumps desk along with a black bag and a key in sight Never leave a key in a classified lockbag in the presence of non-cleared people Heinrich It is hard to recall any other instance in recent US history when the president seemed to handle an urgent national security matter in a public placeOn Sept 11 2001 of course President George W Bush learned of that days terrorist attacks while he was reading a book to children at a Florida elementary school Bush continued reading for at least five minutes before being whisked away on Air Force One to a secure location In Barack Obamas White House two former aides said a situation like the North Korean missile test might have been handled similarly the president would be given a note with the news then taken to a secure room to discuss a response Pete Souza who was Obamas White House photographer posted a photo Monday that showed Obama huddling with national security advisers in a private space during a 2011 trip to El SalvadorWhen we were on the road national security discussions and head of state phone calls were conducted in a private secure location set up on-site Everyone had to leave their Blackberry outside the area The Mar-a-Lago Club which Trump has run since 1995 includes tennis and beach facilities for its members and rents its ballroom out for weddings and galas open to nonmembers Trump has an apartment at the club Club members said that the president seems at ease there among people who have known him for years  and away from the protests and stresses of his new job Hes in a safe space said Mar-a-Lago member Robin Bernstein an insurance executiveSaturday night as guests streamed into Mar-a-Lago for dinner and the wedding reception a parking lot near the club had been converted into a security-check area for vehicles entering the estate A string of BMWs Mercedes and other high-end vehicles were backed up waiting to get through the checkpoint which was staffed by Secret Service agents and officers from the Palm Beach County Sheriffs OfficeInside the club Trump and Abe entered the dining terrace to a standing ovation club members told The Washington Post The two leaders and their wives sat down on the noisy terrace among other diners Richard DeAgazio a retired investor and club member from the Boston area was about six tables away Already that day his status as a Mar-a-Lago member had given him unprecedented access to the president He had snapped pictures of Trump and Abe golfing and taken a photo with White House strategist Stephen K BannonDuring dinner DeAgazio got a text a friend asking him if he was aware of the North Korean missile test He looked over at the presidents tableThats when I saw things changing you know DeAgazio recalled in a telephone interview DeAgazio said a group of staffers surrounded the two world leaders The prime ministers staff sort of surrounded him and they had a little powwowAs Trump and Abe turned their dinner table into an impromptu situation room DeAgazio continued taking pictures and he posted them on Facebook that night  The President receiving the news about the Missile incident from North Korea on Japan with the Prime Minister sitting next to him DeAgazio wrote as the caption for a photo he posted on Facebook at 907 pm Eastern time SaturdayHOLY MOLY  De Agazio wrote later posting more photos of the scene Wow  the center of the actionDeAgazio told The Post that after Trump and Abe had spoken for a few minutes they left the open terrace and spent about 10 minutes in private before conducting a joint news conference at about 1030 pm Later he said Trump and first lady Melania Trump returned to listen to music on the terrace which faces the Intracoastal Waterway and shake hands and schmooze with members and guests at the club  all of whom had paid Trumps business to be there (or been paid-for by their hosts)DeAgazio said he was impressed with how the president handled the situationThere wasnt any panicked look Most of the people [on the terrace] didnt even realize what was happening DeAgazio said I thought he handled it very calmly and very presidentially  Weitzman the parking garage entrepreneur said he didnt notice any weariness or concern in the presidents face even after the news from North Korea He said Trump was jovial The president for instance complimented Weitzmans son-in-law on his recent weight loss Its amazing Weitzman said You know the president of the United States comes over and says You lost a little weight How ya doingDeAgazio the Boston retiree said he was impressed that Trump had not gotten up from the table immediately when the North Korean news brokeHe chooses to be out on the terrace with the members It just shows that hes a man of the people DeAgazio saidMembership at the Mar-a-Lago Club now requires a $200000 initiation fee  a fee that  after Trump was electedDeAgazio said he wasnt worried about the national security implications of Trumps alfresco discussion with Abe He said he was sure they had not been overheardYou dont hear anything You cant hear because of the background music and other diners chatter DeAgazio said I mean I can barely hear whats going on at my table   John Wagner Philip Bump and Abby Phillip contributed to this reportAs a new presidency nears aNew England sheriff has promised President-elect Donald Trump that inmates inBristol County Mass will help him build his contentiouswall along the US-Mexico borderBristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said at his inauguration ceremony Wednesday that he plans to put inmatevolunteers from the Bristol County House of Correction to work along the southern border Its part of Hodgsons proposal for a nationwide network of inmate workers who could help with things like natural disastercleanup and large infrastructureprojectsI can think of no other project that would have such a positive impact on our inmates and our country than building this wall theRepublican sheriff said at Bristol Community College during his swearing-in ceremony for his fourth six-year term in office Aside from learning and perfecting construction skills the symbolism of these inmates building a wall to prevent crime in communities around the country and to preserve jobs and work opportunities for them and other Americans upon release can be very powerful he said  During the presidential campaign building a massive wall along the 2000-mile border atMexicos expense  an effort to keep outundocumentedimmigrants terrorists and illegal drugsThe idea became a focal point at Trumps campaign rallies with supporters chanting  Trump has remained resolute in his planHodgson a reported longtime opponent of illegal immigrationsaid Trumps wall must be builtWe wont have legitimate immigration reform in this country until we build a wall Hodgson said Wednesday according to the Herald NewsAmid debate over who would foot the bill for the wallHodgson announced Project NICE (National Inmates Community Endeavors)a program aimed at rehabilitating inmates by giving them work skills while also providing free labor for bigjobs He said inmates would respond to needs across the country including cleanup and repairs after catastrophicevents such as earthquakes hurricanes andtornadoes They would also work on major projects such as Trumps border wallThink of how much good could come of 500 or 1000 extra hands in rebuilding a community after a disaster and the inmates would learn valuable construction skills and on-the-job training as part of their rehabilitation Hodgson said   Jonathan Darling a spokesman for the sheriffs office told The Washington Post on Thursday that getting Project NICE off the ground will be a top priorityforHodgson during his next six years in officeDarling saidHodgson has been speaking withother sheriffs about his plan for a national network of inmate workers which woulddivide the country into four regions Then when a natural disaster strikesDarling said inmates in thatarea who have volunteered to be in the program would respondAlthoughHodgson did not say Wednesday who would pay to transport and secure inmates on-siteDarling said the sheriff is hoping to partner with theFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) an arm of theDepartment of Homeland Security anduse federal funding to help cover those costsNow that the sheriff has announced his plan for Project NICE he is working to make it official Darling saidThe Bristol County Sheriffs Department will soon give a formal presentation at the annual meeting for the National Sheriffs AssociationThe sheriffs office has reached out to Trumps transition team to formally offer to help build the wall sheriffs officials had not heard back as of Thursday morning Darling said Trump officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment  The proposal has drawn rebuke from the American Civil Liberties Union in Massachusetts which called the sheriffs plan perverseIts inhumane and its most likely unconstitutional Laura Rtolo staff counsel with the ACLU Its also likely an attempt by Sheriff Hodgson just to ride this wave and become famous nationally  I hope we dont have to take this proposal seriouslyRtolo saidthe ACLU is prepared to take the sheriff to court over the matterIf Sheriff Hodgson follows through on this gimmick the ACLU of Massachusetts is prepared to use every tool in our toolbox including litigation to stop him Rtolo told the newspaper The wall itself  is based on racism and hatred and no self-respecting Massachusetts official should have anything to do with itThe idea of using modern-day slave labor to send people thousands of miles away from their Massachusetts home to build a wall to keep out other vulnerable populations its just preposterous she addedDarling the Bristol County Sheriffs Department spokesmanstressed that only inmates who volunteer for the work program will becalled onWe would never force them to do it he saidDarling called it a benefit for qualifying prisoners inBristol County (and beyond) totake part in existing inmate work programs which help shave time off their sentences and give them vocational skills they can use oncethey are released He noted however that the Bristol County Sheriffs Departmentdoesnt send violent offenders to help through the inmate work program  nor would it

pressTrump announced his decision on Twitter late Saturday afternoon The dinner is scheduled for April 29On Sunday White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders  thatthere had been tensions between the president and the mediaI think its kind of naive of us to think that we can all walk into a room for a couple of hours and pretend that some of that tension isnt there Sanders told This Week host George StephanopoulosTrump would skip the dinner to instead spend the night focused on what he can do to help better America Sanders saidYou know one of the things we say in the South [is] If a Girl Scout egged your house would you buy cookies from her I think that this is a pretty similar scenario Sanders added Theres no reason for him to go in and sit and pretend like this is going to be just another Saturday night(The response came at the end of her appearance on the show Pretty straight answer Stephanopoulos replied I think a lot would argue the eggs have gone both ways on that But were going to have to leave it there today)I will not be attending the White House Correspondents Association Dinner this year Please wish everyone well and have a great evening Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Shortly after Trumps tweet on Saturday the president of the White House Correspondents Association which sponsors theannual event said in an email that the dinner would take place even without Trumps attendanceThe dinner has been and will continue to be a celebration of the First Amendment and the important role played by an independent news media in a healthy republic said Jeff Mason WHCA president We look forward to shining a spotlight at the dinner on some of the best political journalism of the past year and recognizing the promising students who represent the next generation of our professionSince Trumps inauguration amidhis increasingly fraught relationship with the press Throughout his campaign heregularly lashed out at the press singling out news outlets as being dishonest and at one point  Sincehis election he has accused certain media outlets of publishing fake news Earlier this month the tense relationship reached a boil when Trump called the media In

Correspondents Associationawards $100000 in scholarships at the annual dinner according to its website and recently started a mentoring program that pairs working journalists with journalism studentsThe annual dinner began in 1921 and in 1924 Calvin Coolidge became the first president to attend the dinner In 1978 Jimmy Carter declined to attend citing exhaustion First lady Rosalynn Carter and Vice President Walter Mondale also didnt show up that year In 1981 President Ronald Reagan managed to deliver remarks by phone even though he was at Camp David recovering from an assassination attemptIf I could give you just one little bit of advice when somebody tells you to get in a car quick do it Trump has attended the dinner beforeIn 2011 then-President Barack Obama roasted Trump at the dinner  five minutes of jokes directed at the man who had raised questions about whether Obama was born in the United StatesNo one is happier no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald said Obama who ultimately released his birth certificate Thats because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter like Did we fake the moon landing What really happened in Roswell And where are Biggie and TupacAt the time Obama joked about Trumps experience to lead the nation  All kidding aside obviously we all know about your credentials and breadth of experience Obama said For example no seriously just recently in an episode of Celebrity Apprentice at the steakhouse the mens cooking team did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks And there was a lot of blame to go around but you Mr Trump recognized that the problem was a lack of leadership and so ultimately you didnt blame Little John or Meatloaf  you fired Gary Busey And these are the kinds of decisions that would keep me up at night Well-handled sir Well-handledObama ended his roast talking about the change a President Trump would bring to the White HouseThen he flashed a picture

State University in San Luis Obispo Bush later nominated Gale Buchanan a plant physiologist to the post in 2006When Barack Obama took office he tapped Rajiv Shah who holds both a medical degree and a master of science in health economics from the University of Pennsylvania for the postCatherine Woteki who earned her doctorate from Virginia Tech and held senior positions at USDA Health and Human Services and the White House Office of Science and Technology served as Agricultures chief scientist from Sept 16 2010 until Jan 20 2017 A food nutrition expert Woteki served as Iowa State Universitys dean of agriculture for five years between Bill Clintons and Obamas time in officeThe current acting undersecretary Ann Bartuska is described as an ecosystem ecologist whos served on multiple scientific councils and panels including the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem ServicesRicardo Salvador director of the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists criticized the prospect of Cloviss selectionIf the president goes forward with this nomination itll be yet another example of blatant dismissal of the value of scientific expertise among his administration appointees Salvador said in a statement Continuing to choose politics over science will give farmers and consumers little confidence that the administration has their interests at heartWoteki said in an interview with on Friday that since the position serves as the agencys chief scientist the occupant should be a person who evaluates the scientific body of evidence and moves appropriately from thereIn the same radio interview Clovis said I have enough of a science background to know when Im being boofedthough he did not detail any past research experience involving the hard sciencesWhile Clovis does not appear to have conducted extensive research in the hard sciences he is a veteran Republican Party activist who joined Trumps presidential campaign In addition to working as a talk radio host he served as a professor of economics at Morningside College in Sioux City Iowa and made an unsuccessful run for the US Senate in 2014During that Senate run Clovis described his credentials for running in an Iowa Public Radio interview 25 years in the military and the various jobs and opportunities I had while serving the nation my experience as a business man and my academic preparation  my experience in a variety of other fields including homeland security foreign policy national security policy creating jobs and all those thingsIn 2015 Clovis took a leave of absence from his position at Morningside College to join the Trump campaign as a chief policy adviserArmy Sgt Bowe Bergdahl appeared on the witness stand Monday and described his five years in Taliban captivity a graphic and at times disturbing account delivered hours after the presiding judge rejected his attorneys appeal to have the case dismissed over incendiary remarks made by President Trump during his campaign for the White HouseIt was never my intention for anyone to be hurt said Bergdahl 31 while reading from prepared remarks He apologized for the horrible mistake of abandoning his post in Afghanistan and endangering other US troops tasked with finding him after his disappearance in 2009 They suffered he said because of my bad choicesBergdahl has pleaded guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy He faces life in prisonHis testimony came as the judge Army Col Jeffery R Nance weighs Trumps comments  the president has called Bergdahl a dirty rotten traitor and suggested he should be executed  against the horrific treatment Bergdahl endured while in captivity and the testimony of other troops who were wounded during the search Though Nance denied Bergdahls motion to dismiss the case he said he would consider Trumps comments as mitigating evidence that could lessen the punishment Bergdahl receives if any  During his testimony Bergdahl described his torture his failed escape attempts his declining health and his dimming prospects for survivalIn detailing his captivity he explained that dirt floors were preferable to cement because they allowed him to bury the chronic diarrhea he experienced thus avoiding further abuse from angry guards who threatened to cut off his nose and ears if he did not stop getting sick He was beat with hoses and kept in a cage much of the time he saidAs he recalled his ordeal one memory caused him to start shaking His face turned red But rather than tell the court what had surfaced in his mind Bergdahl elected to stop  But the court also heard Monday from the prosecutions final witness Shannon Allen whose husband Mark a former master sergeant in the National Guard was nearly killed while searching for Bergdahl Allen was paralyzed after being shot in the head  to collect intelligence on Bergdahls whereaboutsHe was very loud and outgoing Allen said about her husband before he was wounded Areas of his brain that affect memory and motor skills were removed in surgery she said and he can no longer speak walk or care for himself She takes him to appointments and emergency room visits when he appears in distressHe lost me as a wife Ive become his caregiver It doesnt mean I love him any less she said her voice shakingThe court was shown a video of Allen readying her husband for the day as he lay nearly motionless The defense team had objected to scheduling Allens testimony saying the impact on her was too far removed from Bergdahls actions to be considered a factor in his sentencing But Nance allowed it saying her testimony conveyed how one soldiers life has been permanently altered  Bergdahl watched the video And he too offered how his actions in 2009 have bled into the present where flashbacks and hyper-vigilance he said grip him day and nightHe works an administration job at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio near a building where animals are kept Among the peacocks and ducks is at least one rooster Bergdahl said whose call every morning is hauntingHis captors forced him to watch execution videos In one Bergdahl said theres an eerie silence before a mans beheading And then he recalled You can hear the rooster crowingThe US military began deploying an advanced defensive missile system to South Korea on Monday a long-awaited move that was agreed upon with the government in Seoul last summer and follows a series of provocations by North KoreaThe Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system does not use warheads and is designed to shoot down enemy ballistic missiles like the ones launched by Pyongyang into the Sea of Japan on Sunday The deployment comes despite protests from Chinese officials who have said repeatedly over the last year that it is threat to Chinese securityContinued provocative actions by North Korea to include yesterdays launch of multiple missiles only confirm the prudence of our alliance decision last year to deploy THAAD to South Korea said Navy Adm Harry Harris chief of the US Pacific Command We will resolutely honor our alliance commitments to South Korea and stand ready to defend ourselves the American homeland and our alliesChina warned Tuesday that  for hosting the THAAD system and stepped up retaliatory measures against South Korean business interestsThe deployment was announced as North Korean state media reported that the four missiles Pyongyang launched Sunday were  Three of the missiles traveled about 600 miles over North Korea and the Sea of Japan before landing inside of Japans exclusive economic zone The fourth landed just outside the EEZNorth Korea also is believed to have thousands of artillery cannons aimed at its southern neighbor a particular concern for Seoul because the city of 10 million is within range 35 miles from North Koreas borderEach THAAD battery includes at least six truck-mounted launchers that carry up to eight missiles each US military officials stress that it provides strictly defensive capabilities but it also possesses powerful radar that Chinese officials are concerned will be used to observe Chinese airspaceWe firmly oppose the deployment of THAAD said Geng Shuang a spokesman for Chinas Foreign Ministry at a daily press briefing in Beijing on Tuesday We will resolutely take necessary measures to defend our security interestsAll the consequences from this will be borne by the US and the ROK he added referring to South Korea We strongly urge relevant parties to stop deploying it and not travel down the wrong pathSouth Koreas left-wing opposition parties also sharply criticized the governments unilateral rushed move to deploy the THAAD battery ahead of scheduleThe government has completely disregarded public calls and demands from political circles with regard to the THAAD deployment said Youn Kwan-suk the spokesman for the Democratic PartyFrom the clandestine push for the deployment to the process of making the final decision on the installation the government has unilaterally pressed ahead with it without any consultations with citizens he said according to the Yonhap news agencySeveral key details of the deployment have not yet been finalized and the land where the battery will be housed is not yet ready opposition politicians said But South Korean defense officials said they would keep the equipment at the US air base at Osan until the site is readyWhen Seoul and Washington agreed last year on the THAAD unit they were aiming for deployment by the end of July although it had been expedited and was expected to arrive between June and AugustWith the arrival of the first components they could have it up and running sooner The deployment could be completed within one or two months and it can be operational as early as April a South Korean military official told reporters in SeoulConservative politicians said that North Koreas latest missile launches underscored the urgent need for THAADWe welcome the right decision to deploy THAAD when North Korea threatens the security of the Republic of Korea and Northeast Asia by firing as many as four ballistic missiles said Kim Sung-won the spokesman for the ruling Liberty Korea PartyThe timing is politically sensitive because the president Park Geun-hye is likely to find out this week whether she will be impeached The Constitutional Court is expected to issue its decision as soon as Friday on whether to uphold a parliamentary motion to force Park out of office over a corruption scandalMoon Jae-in the leading liberal candidate for the presidency has said he would respect agreements between governments but he has also suggested that he might ask parliament to revisit the THAAD deploymentThe United States and South Korea began discussing the deployment of THAAD more than a year ago and reached an agreement to do so in July Then-President  to the deployment in October saying Washington and Seoul have worked together to prepare for any threat He specifically cited THAAD as an example while calling it a purely defensive system to deter and defend against North Korean threatsDefense Secretary Jim Mattis made his first trip as Pentagon chief to Seoul and Tokyo in January and said then that he anticipated THAAD would arrive in South Korea this yearThe news of  on Monday elicited cheers in Ukraine where activists and politicians seeking to root out political corruption had seethed at the American political operatives counsel to the countrys ousted leader Viktor YanukovychReports of the millions of dollars Manafort had been paid under the table by Ukraines formerruling party were particularly galling  and Ukrainians learned from the indictment Monday those payments may have been even larger than thoughtBut while Washington is wondering where the  into Russian meddling in the US elections will lead next people here are wondering more about what this means for the investigation into the millions of dollars in oligarch wealth that have stubbornly slowed the countrys program of reformIts great news There should be a precedent of punishment for the lobbyists who served these corrupt figures said Serhiy Leshchenko a Ukrainian member of parliament and investigative journalist who published documents showing secret payments to Manafort by the ruling party under Yanukovych and then invoices to Manafort consulting companies on the same dayManafort worked for a long time so that Yanukovych could come to power and use that power for his own corrupt schemes not for reformThe investigation as he saw it is far from finished  I want investigations into all of Manaforts connections and the people who paid him this money he added naming several prominent Ukrainian oligarchsIn a decades-long career Manafort made tens of millions of dollars far beyond the borders of established democracies working for despotic leaders and their allies in countries such as the Philippines and CongoBut his work in one country Ukraine caught up with him on Monday in a criminal indictment describing illicit earnings offshore bank accounts and lavish expenditures funded in part by nearly a decade of work for Ukraines Party of Regions and Yanukovych who fled to Russia after his regime was toppled by protesters in 2014Despite reports of secret payments Mondays 12-count indictment against Manafort and a former business partner still yielded newaccusations for Ukrainian prosecutors investigating the former Yanukovych administrationAmong them lobbying members of Congress for the Ukrainian government in one case using an offshore account to secretly funnel $4 million to commission a report about the trial of former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko  This was new information for us Serhiy Gorbatyuk the head of special investigations for the prosecutors office said in a telephone interviewIt took an unlikely confluence of events  the 2014 political revolution in Ukraine that ousted Yanukovych the discovery of secret campaign finance documents at the headquarters of Ukraines ruling Party of Regions and then Manaforts leading role as campaign manager for President Trump  for Mueller to zero in on Manaforts alleged schemes to launder money evade US taxes and engage in conspiracy against the United StatesIn Kiev where politicians have been careful the Trump administration Manafort remains just a witness as prosecutors pursue corruption charges against the Yanukovych administration Gorbatyuk said his requests to the US Justice Department to cooperate had not received a responseIn order for the case to move forward better we need answers to our questions So far we havent received any Manafort at this moment is a witness in the case he saidWhile  in Kiev the extent of Manaforts wealth was not Mondays indictment alleged that more than $75 million flowed through offshore accounts Manafort and his partner Rick Gates maintained and that Manafort sent more than $54million to vendors for home improvements and $934350 to an antique rug store It alleged as well that he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars more on antiques landscaping Range Rovers and home entertainment systemsHe made that money while working for some of the regions richest men including Russian oligarch  Deripaska in a 2014 Cayman Islands court filing had accused Manafort and Gates of absconding with $19 million of his money earmarked for investments Yet in 2016 Manafort had suggested providing Deripaska with private briefings while he was Trumps campaign chairmanBut the focus of Mondays indictment was the money Manafort made working as a political adviser in Ukraine  developing the election strategies that helped revive the political career of Yanukovych from a bitter defeat in a contested 2004 presidential election up until his ouster by pro-European street demonstrators in 2014Party allies recalled that Manafort coached unpolished politicians from the countrys industrial regions streamlining their talking points and improving their choice in suits Others said he helped parse demographic polls to take advantage of the deep divide between the countrys regionsOn Monday allies and associates of Manaforts in Ukraine where he remains a deeply divisive figure brushed off the allegations calling them the result of a politically motivated witch hunt following Trumps unexpected ascendancy to the presidencyI have every confidence that Paul and Rick will be vindicated by the judicial process currently ongoing in the US said Philip Griffin Manaforts longtime representative in Ukraine I am quite taken by the fact that this has nothing to do with the president or any alleged collusion between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia  and that this is the result of a politically driven fishing expeditionPrevious records from a recovered black ledger of payments to Manafort from Ukraines Party of Regions detailed payments of $127 million but Mondays indictment said Manafort had laundered a larger amount more than $18 million Manafort pleaded not guilty Monday to the 12 counts brought against himWhile Manafort allies focused on the absence of collusion allegations in the indictment the charges still sent shock waves through his network of partners and associates Speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly one associate called them a punch to the gutThe UN Security Council unanimously adopted harsh sanctions Wednesday against North Korea imposing some of the strongest measures ever used to pressure Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons programThe new sanctions come two months after North Korea  and a month after it conducted what was widely described as a banned missile test under the guise of  But US officials began drafting the measures three years ago soon after North Korea conducted a previous nuclear test in order to move swiftly the next time it happened Negotiations to win Chinas support began two days after North Koreas January nuclear test its fourth in a decadeThe resolution is far more sweeping than existing sanctions requiring a link to proliferation activities That precondition has been removed in effect erasing the presumption of innocence  It mandates cargo inspections for all goods going in and out of North Korea by land sea or air chokes off supplies of most aviation fuel for its armed forces and bans the sale of all small arms and conventional weapons to Pyongyang It also prohibits transactions that raise hard cash for North Korea through sales of its natural resourcesThe resolution doubles the blacklist of people and institutions already sanctioned and requires countries to expel North Korean diplomats involved in any sanctioned activitiesOne provision was designed to prevent Pyongyang from sending taekwondo instructors to train foreign police forces Another bars North Koreans from specialized training at any school or research center in the world if the learning can advance Pyongyangs nuclear and ballistic missile programsPresident Obama welcomed the sanctions as a firm and appropriate response to North Koreas attempts to develop weapons of mass destructionToday the international community speaking with one voice has sent Pyongyang a simple message North Korea must abandon these dangerous programs and choose a better path for its people he saidAs soon as the sanctions were released the Treasury Department and the State Department updated their blacklists of people and entities tied to the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea the official name for North Korea and its proliferation programs The designation freezes their US assets and bars Americans from doing business with themThe UN sanctions which target the countrys elites and avoid adverse humanitarian consequences for civilians aim to accomplish what worked with less onerous sanctions on Iran by pushing theto quit pumping money into its nuclear program  The chronic suffering of the people of North Korea is the direct result of the choices made by the DPRK government a government that has consistently prioritized its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs over providing for the most basic needs of its own people said Samantha Power the US ambassador to the United NationsThe North Korean government would rather grow its nuclear weapons program than grow its own children she addedThe resolution was presented by the United States with the support of China a sharp reversal given Beijings longtime support of its neighbor Although the United States has long had an embargo on trade with North Korea China has provided food and fuel and has been a key trading partner In recent years living conditions in North Korea have improved thanks in large part to ChinaIn the past China has been unwilling to tighten the screws on Pyongyang in part out of concern for what an imploding unstable North Korea might mean for Chinas own border But recently North Korea has continued testing new weapons and missiles disregarding Chinas warnings and personal envoysAfter North Korea on Jan 6 detonated a new device  calling it a hydrogen bomb although most experts say it was a smaller nuclear device  Chinas ambassador to six-party talks Wu Dawei went to Pyongyang to urge restraint Instead North Korea announced while he was there that it would test a missileChinas about-face suggests it has started to realize that doing nothing would impose growing political costs internationally  the possibility of a greater US presence in the region and weaker relations with South Korea which Beijing has been cultivatingI expect theres been a delayed recognition in China to the political price China was paying with South Korea in particular for its equivocation or outright silence about how to respond to North Korea and North Korea actions said Jonathan Pollack a specialist on East Asian politics and security at the Brookings Institution  During a visit to Washington last month Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi hinted at the strains in policy toward North KoreaOn the one hand were saying to the international community  that the normal exchanges especially those affecting the livelihoods of the North Korean people should not be adversely affected he said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies On the other hand in order to uphold the international nuclear nonproliferation regime for the sake of denuclearization our exchanges will be affected to some extentBut some analysts question the depth of Chinas commitment to the latest round of sanctionsThe real question going forward is whether China will enforce the new measures said Victor Cha a professor at Georgetown University My guess is that China will squeeze for a little bit but not too hard while the US will want China to squeeze harder and for a longer period of timeSung-Yoon Lee a Korean studies professor at Tufts University said the UN sanctions even if violated in the future will become increasingly meaningful if ordinary citizens in North Korea are adversely affectedThe fact the UN is involved will lend greater legitimacy to the effort to sanction North Korea and enable others like Japan and Europe to shoulder some of the blame if there are negative repercussions from sanctions so the blame doesnt just fall on the shoulders of the United States he saidPreparatory work on the sanctions began in early 2013 immediately after the Security Council passed a sanctions resolution in response to North Koreas third nuclear test according to a State Department official who spoke about the sensitive negotiations on the condition of anonymity US officials concluded that incrementally ratcheting up sanctions was insufficient and that more restrictive measures were needed the official saidAs technical experts from many government agencies met to share ideas a contingency draft of sanctions was repeatedly updated to be ready for a fourth nuclear test by North Korea  On Jan 8 two days after North Korea announced the fourth test diplomats from the US mission to the United Nations presented a draft to the Chinese mission There was little response during January as China studied the proposed sanctions which dropped requirements to prove proliferation links as China had insisted on previouslyChina did not change its position during a Jan 27 visit to Beijing by Secretary of State John F Kerry or during a Feb 5 phone call that Obama placed to Chinese President Xi JinpingBut after the Feb 7 missile test the State Department official said the Chinese came around to the US point of view Throughout much of February US and Chinese diplomats met several times a day to discuss provisions that had to be approved by Beijing the official saidAt 8 or 9 at night diplomats at the US mission would schlep to the Chinese mission the State Department official said Then they would meet again the next day after Beijing had worked through the provisions overnightAfter a tentative agreement was reached early last week US officials had hoped for a quick adoption by the Security Council But there were delays while Russia studied the sanctions to gauge their impact Russia transports coal over a short stretch of railroad in North Korea to a port and Moscow wanted reassurances it would not be banned the official saidIn recent days North Korea has boasted that more sanctions would not hurt Now China South Korea Japan and the United States are awaiting its reaction Early Thursday hours after the sanctions were approved the North fired short-range projectiles into the sea South Koreas Defense Ministry saidWeve seen its reckless and unpredictable acts for years Power said Weve seen threats directed at the continental United States and the Republic of Korea Weve seen cyberattacks on American companies costing hundreds of millions of dollars We do not expect a change of behavior overnightPresident Trump woke before dawn on Monday and burrowed in at the White House residence to wait for the Russia bombshell he knew was comingSeparated from most of his West Wing staff  who fretted over why he was late getting to the Oval Office  Trump clicked on the television and spent the morning playing fuming media critic legal analyst and crisis communications strategist according to several people close to himThe president digested the news of the first indictments in special counsel Robert S Mueller IIIs probe with exasperation and disgust these people said He called his lawyers repeatedly He listened intently to cable news commentary And with rising irritation he watched live footage of his onetime campaign adviser and confidant Paul Manafort turning himself in to the FBIInitially Trump felt vindicated Though frustrated that the media were linking him to the indictment and tarnishing his presidency he cheered that the charges against Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates were focused primarily on activities that began before his campaign Trump tweeted at 1028 am there is NO COLLUSIONBut the presidents celebration was short-lived A few minutes later court documents were unsealed showing that George Papadopoulos an unpaid foreign policy adviser on Trumps campaign pleaded guilty to making a false statement to the FBI about his efforts to broker a relationship between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin The case provides the clearest evidence yet of links between Trumps campaign and Russian officialsFor a president who revels in chaos  and in orchestrating it himself  Monday brought a political storm that Trump could not control White House Chief of Staff John F Kelly along with lawyers Ty Cobb John Dowd and Jay Sekulow advised Trump to be cautious with his public responses but they were a private sounding board for his grievances advisers saidThis has not been a cause of great agita or angst or activity at the White House said Cobb the White House lawyer overseeing Russia matters He added that Trump is spending all of his time on presidential work  But Trumps anger Monday was visible to those who interacted with him and the mood in the corridors of the White House was one of weariness and fear of the unknown As the president groused upstairs many staffers  some of whom have hired lawyers to help them navigate Muellers investigation  privately speculated about where the special counsel might turn nextThe walls are closing in said one senior Republican in close contact with top staffers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly Everyone is freaking outTrump is also increasingly agitated by the expansion of Muellers probe into financial issues beyond the 2016 campaign and about the potential damage to him and his familyThis portrait of Trump and his White House on a day of crisis is based on interviews with 20 senior administration officials Trump friends and key outside allies many of whom insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive internal mattersTrump and his aides were frustrated that yet again Russia steamrolled the start of a carefully planned week of policy news Trump is preparing to nominate a new chairman of the Federal Reserve and is scheduled to depart Friday for a high-stakes 12-day trip across Asia and House Republicans are planning to unveil their tax overhaul billId like to start the briefing today by addressing a topic that I know all of you are preparing to ask me about and thats tax reform White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at Monday afternoons news briefing It was a lighthearted prelude to a question-and-answer session immediately overtaken by queries about the indictmentsAway from the podium Trump staffers fretted privately over whether Manafort or Gates might share with Muellers team damaging information about other colleagues They expressed concern in particular about Gates because he has a young family may be more stretched financially than Manafort and continued to be involved in Trumps political operation and had access to the White House including attending West Wing meetings after Trump was sworn inSome White House advisers are unhappy with Thomas J Barrack Jr Trumps longtime friend and chairman of his inauguration whom they hold responsible for keeping Gates in the Trump orbit long after Manafort resigned as campaign chairman in August 2016 according to people familiar with the situation Barrack has been Gatess patron of late steering political work to him and until Monday employing him as director of the Washington office of his real estate investment companyTrump and his aides tried to shrug off the ominous headlines decorating the South Portico of the White House in black bats and faux spider webs to welcome costumed children for Halloween trick-or-treating As the sun set on Monday the president and first lady Melania Trump handed out goody bags to little princesses and pirates  The Russia drama has been distracting and damaging for Trump  from a public relations perspective if not eventually a legal one The presidents inner circle on Russia matters has tightened in recent months In addition to his lawyers Trump has been talking mostly with Kelly and members of his family including Melania as well as daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner both senior White House advisers Trump also leans on two senior aides counselor Kellyanne Conway and communications director Hope Hicks as well as some outside friends for adviceStill Trump has little ability to influence the ongoing Russia probe save for firing Mueller  the sort of rash decision that his lawyers insisted Monday he is not consideringNothing about todays events alters anything related to our engagement with the special counsel with whom we continue to cooperate Cobb said There are no discussions and there is no consideration being given to terminating MuellerSekulow one of Trumps outside lawyers said Theres no firing-Robert-Mueller discussionsAsked whether Trump is considering pardons for Manafort or Gates Cobb said No no no Thats never come up and wont come upOn Capitol Hill meanwhile some of Trumps allies are privately revving up their own version of a counterattack against Mueller Several top Republican legislators plan to raise questions in the coming days about the FBIs handling of a dossier detailing alleged ties between Trump and Russian interests They intend to argue that Muellers team has become overly reliant on a document that was funded in part by Democrats according to two people involved in the discussions Mueller does not appear to have relied on the dossier for the cases revealed on Monday howeverFor Trump and his team the bad news began as disconcerting drips last Friday when CNN first reported that indictments were probably coming Monday The only question of whomThe White House had no inside information beyond what was public in news reports officials said and was left to scramble and speculate as to what might happen Reliable information was hard to come by as Trumps team was scattered Cobb was at his home in South Carolina until Monday afternoon while Trump spent much of Saturday at his private golf club in Virginia and went out to dinner with Melania and their son Barron at the Trump International Hotels steakhouse in WashingtonAmong the many unknowns the Trump team arrived at an educated guess that Manafort was likely to be indicted  in part according to one White House aide because of reports that television news crews were preparing to stake out Manaforts Virginia homeThis wasnt a shocking development Sekulow said   When the first pair of indictments came naming Manafort and Gates there was palpable relief inside the West Wing The 31-page document did not name Trump nor did it address any possible collusion between Russia and the presidents campaignMoreover aides were simply happy that the initial batch of indictments did not include Michael Flynn Trumps former and controversial national security adviser who was fired from his top White House perch after misleading Vice President Pence about his contacts with Russian officials Flynn had been intimately involved in both the campaign and the early days of the administration and a Flynn indictment most staff believed would have been far more damagingThe indictment of Gates  who had played a quiet behind-the-scenes role in Trumps orbit  was more of a surprise though he had served as Manaforts campaign deputy and protege Trumps team quickly settled on a messaging plan The duos alleged misdeeds the White House argued had nothing to do with the president or his campaignPrivately aides and allies acknowledged that the campaign had perhaps not sufficiently vetted the two men before bringing them on boardMichael Caputo a former campaign adviser whom Trump praised Monday morning on Twitter for his appearance on Fox News Channels Fox & Friends later called the indictments one big huge failRick and Paul I would consider them friends of the president because they worked so closely with him Caputo said The presidents watching closely and he should be concerned for his friends welfare but he has absolutely no concern about collusion with Russia because there was noneOn Sunday Trump had attempted to seek refuge from the political squall with another round of golf at his Virginia club Sens Lindsey O Graham (R-SC) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis) were set to join him according to two people briefed on the plans  an afternoon of camaraderie and talk about his tax proposalIt was not to be Rainy weather forced the White House to cancel the outing  yet another disappointment beyond the presidents control John Wagner contributed to this reportAs the United States has looked for various ways to punish North Korea for its nuclear intransigence one factor has remained constant ChinaFinancial transactions mineral exports luxury imports  all of them come through China making the nations enforcement of international sanctions critical to their successA once-reluctant  to inflict pain on Pyongyang this year But that could be changing the unintended result of the United States and South Koreas  to protect against North KoreaChina has been complaining about this at the highest levels said Scott Snyder a Korea expert at the Council on Foreign Relations Will this be a factor that diminishes their implementation of UN Security Council resolutionsPresident Park Geun-hyes administration in Seoul had been equivocating on whether to host a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) antimissile unit for the US military fearful of angering Beijing China is South Koreas biggest trading partner with its bilateral trade worth twice as much as that with the United States  But North Koreas recent actions  its nuclear test and long-range missile launch at the beginning of this year  prompted Seoul to agree in July to host the battery Early Wednesday the North was reported to have test-fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile off its east coastBeijing which views the THAAD deployment as a way to keep China in check has taken a range of actions recently to express its displeasure The United States has a strategic plot to destabilize regional security the state-run Peoples Daily said in an editorial shortly after the decisionSo far this month Beijing has suspended operations of the travel agency that helped South Koreans get multiple-entry visas for China  a visa used especially by those doing business with 300000 issued a year  and tourism has been hitOne tour-bus company told South Koreas CNBC channel that 30 to 40 percent of reservations had been canceled while the Dong-A newspaper quoted travel firms as saying that Chinese tour package reservations for September and October were one-fifth lower than the same months last yearSome South Korean actors who star in dramas that are popular in China have had their public appearances canceled and some here even saw THAAD behind the Chinese city of Qingdaos last-minute decision to cancel its participation in a chicken-and-beer festival in its South Korean sister city of Daegu  Throughout North Koreas decades of malfeasance Chinas overarching concern has been to ensure that its irascible neighbor remains intact and does not spill hungry refugees  or nuclear material  over its borderBut in the past few years Beijing has shown signs of cracking down on the Kim Jong Un regime most recently in March when it supported the UN Security Council resolution to impose tough new sanctions  on mining exports in particular  on PyongyangHopes that China would follow through with implementation appear however to have been short-livedChinese customs data showed that bilateral trade with North Korea was valued at $504million in June three months after the sanctions were imposed and the month before the THAAD announcement That is almost 10percent higher than the year beforeTrade has continued at a brisk pace in the past two months said Lim Eul-chul of Kyungnam Universitys Graduate School of North Korean StudiesChinese companies that had held back on trading with the North have started to ship more goods after hearing the news that Seoul-Beijing relations have taken a turn for the worse over the THAAD issue Lim told the Yonhap News Agency  The effort to squeeze the North has probably been neutralized by THAAD and the Chinese response Snyder saidThe THAAD decision had coincided with other US moves to sanction Kim by name to designate North Korea as a primary money laundering concern and to endorse an international ruling rejecting Chinas claim to the South China SeaEven if each decision may have been correct on its own Snyder said the four things together project an image of US policy that is clearly not well received in BeijingKim Sook a former South Korean ambassador to the United Nations agreedTHAAD happened at the same time as the South China Sea decision so China might have been doubly disappointed he said adding that the South Korean decision to host the missile battery was the right one even if the timing was offStrategically our government has mishandled the case Kim said They hesitated for three years when they should have moved swiftlyA trio of watchdog groups has asked the US attorney for the Southern District of New York to investigate whether President Trump has received payments or other benefits from foreign governments through his business interests in violation of an obscure clause in the US Constitution The request sent by letter Wednesday morning to  is a novel strategy by ethics critics who have been pressing Trump to comply with the Constitutions emoluments clause which prohibits top officials from receiving payments or favors from foreign governments Trumps business empire stretches across the globe The letter was sent six weeks after one of the groups filed a lawsuit in federal district court making a similar claimTrump has said he addressed ethics concerns by turning over management of his business to his adult sons whove said they have separated the family business from their relationship with their father and the US governmentThere are lines we would never cross  in a recent interview and thats mixing business with anything government  On Wednesday the White House referred questions to the Trump Organization where attorney Alan Garten dismissed the letter as factually inaccurate legally erroneous and politically motivatedAlthough the president has relinquished day-to-day management of his businesses his critics say his continued ownership interest means he effectively receives benefits from foreign entities in violation of the Constitution The ethics advocates mostly Democrats have held news conferences and filed a lawsuit Now they are asking one of the countrys leading federal prosecutors for helpWe call on you as the United States Attorney for the jurisdiction where The Trump Organization is located to exercise your responsibility to investigate and take appropriate action to ensure that the Trump Organization and related Trump business enterprises do not receive payments and financial benefits from foreign governments that benefit President Trump the letter said It is signed by Fred Wertheimer president of Democracy 21 bipartisan leaders of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington organization (CREW) and Paul Smith of the Campaign Legal Center  It cannot be the case that the president can flagrantly violate the Constitution and get away with it said Norman L Eisen who served as ethics counsel under President Barack Obama Eisen who signed the letter as chairman of CREW acknowledged that asking a US attorney to investigate a matter involving a sitting president is unusual But he said having a president with these conflicts is also unprecedented The letter is also signed by CREWs vice chair Richard Painter who served as ethics counsel to President George W BushIn January CREW in federal district court arguing that his continued receipt of payments from foreign entities violated the Constitutions emoluments clause Trumps reply in that case is due April 1 Eisen said the request to the US attorney should not be seen as a sign that the suit will not move forward We believe our complaint in the judicial branch should not exclude review by the other branches of government he said citing the importance of the emoluments restrictionThat clause says that no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under [the United States] shall without the Consent of the Congress accept of any present Emolument Office or Title of any kind whatever from any King Prince or foreign State It was written in to Article I out of concern that the fledgling countrys leaders could be influenced by a wealthy European power  The meaning of the clause  The watchdog groups say the text should be interpreted to mean that Trumps businesses should cease commercial transactions with foreign statesThe letter notes that China recently granted Trump a trademark for building construction services It also points out that tenants of Trump Tower in New York include a Chinese bank and the Abu Dhabi Tourism and Culture Authority and that the Trump hotel in Washington has been courting business from foreign diplomats The document notes that Trumps business entities have plans to build luxury hotels in China and that it is also engaged in real estate and licensing projects in India Indonesia the Philippines Saudi Arabia Scotland Taiwan and Turkey We believe the Justice Department has a broad mandate to ensure compliance with provisions of the Constitution that relate to Federal officeholders the letter said The letter noted testimony of Attorney General Jeff Sessions in his confirmation hearings Sessions stated that although he was not aware of a federal law that directly charges the Justice Department with enforcing the emoluments clause he recognized that the Justice Department has the responsibility to ensure that officeholders comply with their constitutional obligationsWertheimer said that the request was made because he sees a powerful record that President Trump is receiving benefits that do not comply with the emoluments clause He and other signers said Bharara was chosen in part because he is known for fierce independence Since he was appointed in 2009 he has investigated New York Gov Andrew M Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio both Democrats Although Bharara was appointed by Obama  after the election and asked him to stay on as US attorneyA tearful University of Virginia student detained in North Korea confessed in a highly orchestrated news conference Monday to the very severe and pre-planned crime of trying to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel in Pyongyang  had not been seen since  on Jan2 at the end of a five-day tour to North Korea The trip was a stopover on his way to Hong Kong where he was to take part in a university-sponsored financial classBut it wasnt until three weeks later that Kim Jong Uns regime announced it was holding the Ohio native for an unspecified hostile act against the state In the meantime North Korea has conducted a nuclear test and a long-range missile launch inflaming tensions with the outside worldEscorted by North Korean guards into a news conference in Pyongyang on Monday Warmbier reading from handwritten notes said he had tried to steal a political sign promoting the [North] Korean peoples love for their system from the hotel  The aim of my task was to harm the motivation and work ethic of the Korean people This was a very foolish aim Warmbier said He was wearing a beige jacket with a shirt and tie and was cleanshaven He appeared to be in good healthAmericans who previously have been detained in North Korea have also been  with the detainees told what to say and the reporters told what to ask After saying he had made the worst mistake of my life as he asked for forgiveness Warmbier performed a deep bow in front of the mainly North Korean reportersAnalysts say Warmbier was probably told what to say and how to deliver the bizarre statement in which the student said he was impressed by North Koreas humanitarian treatment of severe criminals like myself and referred to the connivance of the United States administrationSuch confessions which are repeatedly played on North Korean television for domestic propaganda purposes are usually a necessary step before detainees can be releasedHowever recent detainees have had to go through a show trial and conviction before being freedWarmbiers parents Fred and Cindy have not been able to contact their son since his arrest and released a statement through U-Va in which they urged North Korea to release himI hope the fact that he has conveyed his sincere apology for anything that he may have done wrong will now make it possible for the DPRK authorities to allow him to return home the statement said using the official acronym for North Korea and written in the voice of Fred I urge the DPRK government to consider his youth and make an important humanitarian gesture by allowing him to return to his loved onesIn his appearance before the media Otto Warmbier said he had been instructed by a female member of Friendship United Methodist Church in Wyoming Ohio to steal one of North Koreas ubiquitous propaganda signs and take it back to the United States as a trophyAll across North Korea from factories and government offices to hillsides and intersections there are propangandistic slogans lauding the ruling Kim regime which maintains power through an all-encompassing personality cult Speaking ill of the Kims  or even folding a newspaper so the leaders face is halved  is treasonousTaking the banner would harm the unity and motivation of the North Korean people and show this country an insult from the West Warmbier said adding that the plan had the US governments approval  The church member would give him a used car worth $10000 if he stole the sign and would pay $200000 to his mother if he was arrested in the processWarmbier said his familys very severe financial difficulties made him do it I started to consider this as my only golden opportunity to earn money he said adding that his family would not be paid if he mentioned the churchs involvementHe also said that the Z Society a student group at U-Va clandestinely encouraged my act  The slogan was on a staff-only floor of the Yanggakdo hotel which is called Alcatraz by regular foreign visitors because it is situated on an island in the river that runs through Pyongyang and impossible to get off without detection He reportedly pulled the banner from the wall but realized it was too big to carry off so he abandoned it thereWarmbier was on a trip organized by  one of a handful of travel companies that take  The company which had previously referred to an incident at the hotel said it had nothing to add following Warmbiers statementIn Washington White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that the US government which does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea was working with the Swedish Embassy which represents American interests there on the caseAs Virginias heated gubernatorial election draws near a Democratic group on Monday released an ad featuring a pickup truck flying a Confederate flag and sporting a bumper sticker for Republican Ed Gillespie chasing a group of minority children The minute-long spot from the Latino Victory Fund ends with the children waking up from a nightmare and adults watching footage on television of torch-bearing white nationalists marching in Charlottesville Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by the American Dream the narrator says The commercial which the Latino Victory Fund says is airing through Election Day on Spanish-language stations in Richmond and Washington market is the latest in a bitter battle on the airwaves  Gillespie a longtime GOP operative has launched ads seeking to tie his Democratic opponent Ralph Northam to  and a  who briefly got his rights restored The Republican candidate has also launched commercials vowing to protect the states Confederate monuments and warning that Northam supports their removal Gillespies advertising has drawn a rebuke from minority advocacy groups Democrats and in recent days from some Republicans who see it as a departure from Gillespies long-standing position that the GOP needs to reach out to nonwhite voters   Northam retaliated with a blasting Gillespies commercials as false attacks and despicable He also approved a Democratic mailer  who marched in Charlottesville urging voters to stand up to Trump Gillespie and hate Republicans blasted that mailer and accused Northam of exploiting the deadly violence in Charlottesville for political gain They also note that Gillespie repeatedly condemned the white supremacists of Charlottesville But Democrats have responded that Gillespies campaign has commercials have amplified stereotypes about Latinos and that the candidate never explicitly condemned President Trumps remarks that there were very fine people on both sides during the Charlottesville conflict between neo-Nazis and counter protesters Its a very stark ad but those portrayals in the ad are what Latino and immigrant communities feel right now in Virginia Latino Victory Fund President Cristbal J Alex said If Gillespie is successful in scapegoating Latinos and borrowing from Trumps playbook we will see those types of attacks against our community throughout the 2018 midtermsGillespie campaign manager Chris Leavitt called the ads from the Latino Victory Fund a desperate smear campaignNow his allies have reached a new low with a disgusting vile television ad seeking to instill fear in our children with that same imagery Leavitt said This is not an attack on Ed Gillespie anymore This is an all-out attack on the people of Virginia This latest ad gives a clear indication of just what Ralph Northam and his national Democratic allies think of all of us and its sickening A Northam campaign spokeswoman expressed no misgivings about the Latino Victory Fund adIndependent groups are denouncing Ed Gillespie because he has run the most divisive fear mongering campaign in modern history said Ofirah Yheskel It is not shocking that communities of color are scared of what his Trump-like policy positions mean for themGillespie spent Sunday campaigning with US Sen Rob Portman (R-Ohio) before a diverse crowd in a Vietnamese shopping center Portman touted Gillespies moderate positions on issues of addiction and criminal justice and defended him from critics disappointed by his ad campaign Hes a Republican reformer Portman told the Post He goes everywhere hell talk to everybody I think hell be a national leaderGerman voters on Sunday appeared to send a message to Chancellor Angela Merkel Close the door on migrantsHer center-right Christian Democratic Party suffered universal setbacks in local elections  in a vote widely seen as a referendum on Merkels humanitarian stance allowing vast waves of migrants to cross German bordersThe upstart Alternative for Germany (AfD) party a populist force that campaigned on an anti-migrant anti-Merkel platform  and which drew support from the left as well as the right  scored big gains It landed 244 percent of the vote in one of the three states that went to the ballot box according to projections based on exit polls produced for the German public broadcaster ARD  The outcome amounted to a blow to Merkel just as the chancellor is set to fight this week for a new accord between the European Union and Turkey on the refugee crisis It would stop the illegal flow of migrants across the Aegean Sea but also compel reluctant European nations including Germany to take in more Syrian asylum seekers from TurkeyAt home Merkel has already vowed to speed up deportations of migrants who are not fleeing war In the past 12 months more than a million migrants from the Middle East and beyond have sought sanctuary and jobs in Europes economic powerhouse Yet in a sign that public tolerance may be growing thin voter turnout was up Sunday and above 70 percent in two of the states voting  The results will probably further fuel the existing unease with Merkel within her own CDU said Carsten Nickel senior vice president of Teneo IntelligenceThe CDUs worst losses of the night came in Baden-Wuerttemberg where her party was falling to 27 percent support  a record low The CDU had held sway in the state for most of the post-World War II era but ended the night down 12 percentage points from its last showingThe CDU also lost ground  but less about 3 percentage points  in the states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt Importantly one of the CDUs rising stars Julia Klckner was failing in her bid to unseat the incumbent for Rhineland-Palatinates top jobAt the same time the AfD  a party that sought to tap the anxiety of Germans over the wave of newcomers  made strong gains The party drew voters to the polls who had rarely or never participated in elections Projections showed it winning more than 24 percent in Saxony-Anhalt located in the former East Germany where anti-migrant sentiment is running particularly high The AfD also gained ground in the two other states with preliminary results showing it won 126 percent of the vote in Rhineland-Palatinate and 151 percent in wealthy heavily industrialized Baden-Wuerttemberg  Nevertheless analysts predicted that Merkel who has defended her plan to shelter war-torn refugees while weeding out economic migrants probably would hold firm She has the luxury of claiming that key local CDU politicians including Klckner who failed on Sunday have criticized her refugee policy They lost to opposition politicians who sometimes had been more supportive of the chancellors refugee policy than members of her own partyWhen it comes to the refugee crisis Merkel might change her tone but not her politics said Jrgen Falter a political analyst at Mainz University She seems to be so utterly convinced of her strategy that I do not expect her to do anything different unless her European partners force her to Stephanie Kirchner contributed to this reportThere are three reasons the Trump dossier has been elevated as one of the central points of consideration in the public investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaignThe first is that it involves the characters and language of a John Le Carr novel a former British intelligence officer communing with shadowy Muscovites identified only by letters and detailing secret meetings in exotic places hidden payments and illegal agreements to seize the American presidencyThe second is that the political stakes are high The dossiers roots lie with an  picking up an effort begun by an unnamed Republican client in the primary but accelerated with the hiring of the Briton Christopher Steele Steele compiled the 35-page document that was ultimately  and how and why he did so has been nailed down only recentlyThe third reason people have paid so much attention to it is the unproven assertion  generally described as salacious  that Trump was party to a particular event in a Moscow hotel room You already know what Im referring to so I wont get into itThat assertion is unproven  as are many of the other claims in the document That includes the overarching claim that Russian government officials allied with Trump employees and campaign aides to help his election But the importance of assessing that claim has led Trump supporters to dismiss the dossier and its contents out of hand and critics of the president to lift up individual statements as accurate to suggest that the overarching claim is as wellWe decided to evaluate the claims in the dossier as best we could to guide that debate Its certainly the case that we may have missed something if so The dossier is composed of 17 company intelligence reports each assigned a number between 80 and 135 and most of which include the date the report was completed  although the numeric order doesnt always match the calendar orderNote that we cant verify that the reports actually  from those dates This is important because the reports do sometimes make claims that were proven to be accurate by later reporting  but we dont know that they werent written after those reports and dated priorWe do know that in late October of last year Mother Joness David Corn  having seen the dossier and its contents BuzzFeed  the version we reviewed in early January Any reports after that point were clearly after the factIts also worth noting that the information included in the reports is mostly unverified humint  intelligence gathered by talking to people As Wired  shortly after the dossier was published such intelligence will usually be flagged with indicators suggesting how credible the sources and claims should be considered The dossier lacks thatWriting for the National Review David Satter  that the dossier also seemed to comport with the idea of Russian actors deliberately sharing information meant to position Russia in a particular wayFor referenceWe will evaluate the claims in each report individually Its critical to note that these claims are for the most part  verified and should not be considered as such Dated June 20 2016 Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian government had sought to cultivate Trump for a period of five years (that is beginning in 2011) Report suggests that Trump was offered and declined real-estate deals and that the Russians have compromising information on both Trump and Clinton Trumps relationship with Russian interests extends back  during which time he may have been contacted by Russian agents In 2011 Trump was flirting with running for president including by attacking President Barack Obamas nativity By 2013 hed partnered with a businessman named Aras Agalarov to host the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow It was Agalarov and his son Emin who were later the vehicle for orchestrating a meeting between a Kremlin-backed lawyer and Donald Trump Jr at Trump Tower in June 2016Theres no evidence at hand that this cultivation took place however The dossier claims a carrot-and-stick approach to keeping Trump in line with the carrot being those real estate deals and the stick being the salacious event Subsequent reporting though indicates that Trump Organization lawyer Michael Cohen (whose name will come up again)  Putin aide Dmitry Peskov (whose name also will come up again) in January 2016 to ask for help in advancing a project in the capital The deal collapsed  undercutting the idea that six months later Russia would have claimed to be trying to bolster Trumps efforts in the cityThe report also suggests that the compromising information on Clinton was mostly in the form of recordings of comments made while traveling in Russia (This information is said to be controlled by Peskov per the report) By this time hackers believed to be tied to the Russian government already had  network and the email of Clinton campaign chairman  information that was discussed in later reports Neither is mentioned in this report from late June before either set of hacked documents was released via WikiLeaks Dated July 19 2016 Trump campaign aide Carter Page met with thechief executive of fossil-fuel giant Rosneft Igor Sechin and Kremlin official Igor Diveykin who American officials  was in charge of collecting intelligence about the campaign Diveykin again raised the compromising material about Clinton with Page Page was in Moscow in early July a trip that was reported at the time He denied meeting Sechin or Diveykin This report suggests that Diveykin offered to release the compromising information on Clinton to Trumps campaign team  an offer that we now know was made before that June meeting in Trump Tower as well Its not clear why Diveykin would make this offer after having already had the opportunity to release that information to Donald Trump Jr a month earlier Undated An ethnic Russian close associate of  Trump says theres a conspiracy of cooperating between the campaign and Moscow The source says that Russia hacked the DNC and leaked the files to WikiLeaks to maintain plausible deniabilityTrumps team had repaid Russia by sidelining Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue and questioning NATOs commitments in the BalticsThe migr claimed a tripartite group of actors Firstly there were agents/facilitators within the Democratic Party structure itself secondly Russian migr and associated offensive cyber operators based in the US and thirdly state-sponsored cyberoperatives working in Russia Diplomatic staff in several cities were using the migr pension distribution system as cover for communicating with RussiaThe report claimed that Trump had sought a real estate deal in St Petersburg as well and that the campaign was comfortable with attention being focused on Russia because it distracted the media from business dealings in China and other emerging markets that included bribes and kickbacks Its not clear when this report was written but the contents and context suggest that it is from late JulyEmails from the DNC were published on WikiLeaks on July 22 but some files were published by Guccifer 20 in mid-June Before any files were released The Washington Post had  Russian actors as the likely culprits Its unlikely then that an outside observer wouldnt have known what the migr claimed about the hacksBy late July Trump had already  NATOs role The Post also had already  on the Trump campaigns efforts to remove language from the party platform at the convention that would have bolstered Ukraine in its fight with RussiaThe overarching assertion in this report is the most important one That Trumps team and Russian actors were colluding This too hasnt been proven and its not clear the extent to which the investigations of that collusion that we know exist were spurred by the dossier itselfIts hard to evaluate the other claims made above but its clear that Trump did seek  business deal in St Petersburg (perhaps including a reality show) There also has been reporting by the New Yorker on projects in  and  that may have raised questions about possible bribery and corruption Dated July 26 2016 Russia has an extensive program aimed at hacking foreign adversaries Some examples are provided that dont seem to be related to what happened to 2016 That the Russians were actively hacking Westerners is clearly true and was well-known even before the electionAlthough its not clear how the DNC servers were accessed it doesnt seem to have been through the means described in this report Podestas email was hacked using  which isnt mentioned in this report Dated July 30 2016 The Russian government was nervous about the attention paid to its role in leaking information specifically the DNC emailsThe report also claims that Trump and his associates had for at least eight years been providing Russia with intelligence on the activities business and otherwise in the US of leading Russian oligarchs and their families Sourced to a Russian migr figure close to  Trump the report claims that the Kremlin had more intelligence on Clinton but didnt know when it might be released This could be a reference to the Podesta emails that were released in OctoberWe also fall into what might be called the Nostradamus trap Retrofitting what we know now to what was written about beforehand The vagueness of more intelligence makes it hard to say this is a description of the Podesta hackIts also not clear how or if Trump did (or could have) provided Moscow with information on oligarchs Dated Aug 5 2016 Details internal dissension in Russia over blowback from the intervention efforts Sergei Ivanov Putins chief of staff is reported to be angry about the intervention efforts of Peskov and others This report is largely inconsequential for our purposes Dated Aug 10 2016 Similar to Report 100 this document mostly details internal dynamics It also asserts that no new leaks [were] envisaged as too politically risky but rather further exploitation of (WikiLeaks) material already disseminated to exacerbate divisions The goal of the existing leaks was to turn educated youth against Clinton and toward TrumpThe Kremlin was also reaching out to other political figures funding trips to Moscow Those figures included Green Party candidate Jill Stein Michael T Flynn and Carter Page Russia had already accessed Podestas email by this point according to US authorities so this report seems to be claiming that those emails would not be releasedOtherwise this information was already known Young voters were more skeptical of Clinton than others as evidenced by the already-concluded Democratic primary Flynn (an adviser to Trump) and Stein visited Moscow for RTs 10-year anniversary  a visit that was  Pages visit is discussed above Dated Aug 10 2016 This report focuses on the same ethnic Russian associate of Trumps and largely discusses what the campaign hoped to do (such as turning young voters against Clinton) This report is largely inconsequential for our purposes Dated Aug 22 2016 Former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych told Putin that hed paid Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort under the table but that it was untraceable Report cites a Trump associate claiming that the revelation of those payments was part of why Manafort left the campaign (as he did shortly before the reports publishing date)  and part was pressure from former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski The role of the alleged payments was  as a reason for Manaforts ouster The tension between him and Lewandowski was not unknown and neither was the fact that Lewandowski still spoke with Trump regularly Dated Sep 14 2016 The Russians have further compromising material about Clinton described as emails that they are considering disseminating after the Russian legislative elections in late SeptemberChief of staff Ivanov was fired which the report suggests was because of the advice he gave Putin on the issue of election intervention The report says that a diplomat was also removed from the Washington embassy because of possible exposure from his role in the meddling The claim about the emails is significant offering one of the few indicators that Steele uncovered the existence of the Podesta hack before it became public (The emails were published in early October) The vagueness of the description of the material though might also be a reference to some other batch of informationIvanovs  was reported as a power struggle Putin described it publicly as having been the natural conclusion of Ivanovs term of serviceThe question of the ousted diplomat is interesting Steele writes his name as Mikhail Kulagin In August Mikhail   after six years in DC a move that doesnt appear to have been reported at the timeIt was widely reported that US intelligence officials had verified Steeles claim about Kalugin  that he was an intelligence officer Whether he was withdrawn for involvement in meddling though is not clear Dated Sep 14 2016 Deals with a business relationship involving Putin This report is largely inconsequential for our purposes Dated Sep 14 2016 Asserts that Trump paid bribes for possible business deals in St Petersburg a claim that Agalarov could verify As mentioned above Trump did seek  set in the city Other business dealings are unclear Dated Oct 12 2016 Russia had injected further anti-Clinton material into the plausibly deniable leaks pipeline that would keep emerging Putin was angry about how the operation was progressing though his administration had assumed direct control  to the extent that Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrovs job might be at risk By Oct 12 the Podesta emails were dripping out WikiLeaks  the pipeline apparently used for the DNC hacks as well  was  regularly and would continue to do so That a number of releases had already occurred would be known to most outside observersThe report indicates that the effort to intervene on behalf of Trump originated with Lavrovs department and eventually made its way to Putins team directly This comports with  about Putin having a direct hand in the effort That said Lavrov still holds his position Dated Oct 18 2016 One of the more significant reports it again asserts that Page met with Rosneft chief executive Sechin in July At the meeting Sechin offered Page and Trump a 19 percent stake in Rosneft in exchange for lifting sanctions on Russia if electedIt also asserts that Cohen Trumps lawyer was playing a key role in the Russia-Trump relationship The Rosneft claim received a lot of attention when in January a 195 percent stake in the company was sold to  Later reporting though indicated that the buyers were  It was essentially a loan and Moscow prearranged to buy back some of the company from the QatarisThat said Trump did seek to quickly  on Russia imposed after the country seized Crimea in 2014More on Cohen below Dated Oct 19 2016 The report claims that Cohen played an important role liaising between Trumps team and Moscow including meeting with Russian agents to cover up Manaforts involvement in Ukraine and Pages interactions with the Russians More below Dated Oct 20 2016 Claims that Cohen traveled to Prague at some point in August to coordinate the relationship There he met with Russian agents at  an agency that distributes foreign aid Cohen has repeatedly  any such meeting saying that his one trip to Europe in 2016 was a July trip to Italy  backed up by  He also says that he was in California for the last week of August  with his sonThere has been no evidence presented to place Cohen in Prague Dated Dec 13 2016 Cohens trip to Prague included three colleagues and centered on how to clean up the evidence of collusion including determining how to make final payments from both Russia and Trump to hackersThe report also outlined that an unidentified company and its affiliates had been using botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses plant bugs steal data and conduct altering operations against the Democratic party leadership If Clinton won the presidency the plan was to pay off the Romanian hackers and have other participants head to Bulgaria to lay low Again theres no evidence Cohen was in Prague This report claims that he was there during that last week in August or early September USC confirmed Cohens visit during that first period to While its not clear how the DNC server was accessed we do know that the Podesta emails were obtained through a phishing attempt not by leveraging botnets porn or bugsThe Steele dossier makes a wide range of claims many of which are rumors that couldnt be independently verified Many other claims involve things that would have been publicly known at the time the report was apparently drafted Although its impossible to say that the dossier is entirely inaccurate (there are some glimmers of accurate predictions) it is also impossible to say that it has been broadly validatedThat unsatisfying answer has a side effect It gives either side of the political fight all the ammo that it might wantGeorge Washington wanted a little adviceIt was 1789 he had just become the president of the newly minted United States of America and he was about to issue the nations first executive order  except it was more of an executive  he asked the heads of various federal departmentsto impress me with a full precise and distinct general idea of the affairs of the United StatesThere were a lot of affairs Washington was trying to grow almost from scratch a centralized federal government in a nation full of people who had just rebelled against a central authorityThe first president needed to decide whether to tax wealthy businessmen who had helped fund the American Revolution or a growing middle class looking for an economic foothold England and France were headed toward warWashington wanted his advisers to help him get a handle on the country he was leading before they started making policyIt will be much easier to commence the administration upon a well-adjusted system built on tenable grounds than to correct errors or alter inconveniences after they shall have been confirmed by habit he wrote to Vice President John Adams a month earlier  Now 228 years later historians wonder whether President Trump could take a history lesson from Washingtons first executive order (Such actionswerent officially called executive orders until Abraham Lincolns presidency according to Kenneth R Mayer a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin at Madison But the concept was essentially the same)Trump has signed more than 10 executive orders during his first few weeks in office that are intended to crack down on crime and violence in AmericaThere have also been executive orders to address health care ethics financial regulations and infrastructureSigning orders to move forward with the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines in the Oval Office  Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Some of Trumps executive orders and actions have of course been more controversial than othersA week into his term Trump signed  which  from seven majority-Muslim nationsDays later the acting attorney general questioned the legality of the order and told Justice Department lawyers not to defend it   The legality of the ban has been debated in federal court On Thursdayin a unanimous that triggered an angry response from a president  of lateSEE YOU IN COURT THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Earlier a  froze federal hiring But shortly afterward the freeze was criticized because it disproportionately hurt veterans who receive preference in federal jobsTrumps executive actions have come at a rapid clip which is to be expected said Mayerthe political science professorA new president works quickly to assert his authority over the federal government Mayer said in an interview What is unusual is the scope of what Trump has tried to do and frankly the casualness with which these orders have come outThey were not properly vettedOne of the reasons the immigration order was struck down Mayer said is because it was so sloppily executedIn some cases federal agencies charged with enforcing the new administrations executive orders say they were blindsidedThe departments of homeland security and state seem to be learning about things after the fact said Cristina Rodrguez a constitutional law professor at Yale I dont think weve seen anything like this before Its a disregard for reality  the desire to bypass agencies altogether  Government fact-finding has grown more complex as the executive branch has expanded Rodrguez told The PostWhen Washington assumed the presidency he didnt have senior advisers a modern president wouldnt need an executive order to find out details of a policy proposalStill its uncommon for a president not to vet executive orders with the agencies that would have to carry them out she saidIts necessary in a different way now because society is much more complex and government has a much broader reach Rodrguez said You probably need greater expertise and people have been specialized in a way that they may not have had in [Washingtons] timeAs The Fixs Basically an executive order is an official statement from the president about how the federal agencies he oversees are touse their resourcesIt falls under the broader umbrella of executive actionswhich derive their power fromArticle II of the Constitution and it is the most formal executive action Executive actions also include presidential memorandums (which are a step below executive orders and basically outline the administrations position on a policy issue) proclamations and directivesAn executive orderis not the president creating new law or appropriating new money from the US Treasury  both things that are the domain of Congress it is the president instructing the government how it is to work within the parameters that are already set by Congress and the ConstitutionTrumps  for example basically establishes building the wall as a federal priority and directs the Department of Homeland Security to use already-available funding to get the ball rolling on its constructionThe presidents executive orders are recorded in the Federal Register and are considered binding but they are subject to legal reviewIn his explainer Blake noted that executive orders have often been the subject of controversy with the opposition party accusing the president of overstepping his authority and acting like a dictator Basically theyre arguing that hes  the law rather than working within itPresidents can blunt some of that criticism by consulting which has benefitsbeyond merely getting things right according to  a historian who has written extensively about American life after the Revolutionary WarThe conversations before the orders show that the executive branch is listening to the people paid to advise the president and to the people he represents That desire dates back to the years before the RevolutionAmericans had a paranoid fear of a dictator  that was the terrifying fear that lurked in every Americans heart Fleming told The Post Washington was aware of that and thats something Trump needs to learnHes much too in love with these executive orders and acting solo without any advice Thats the way you show the people that the government is acting in the best interest of the people that its actually representing themSpecial counsel Robert S Mueller III on Monday former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his longtime business partner Rick Gates as well as charges against former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos who pleaded guilty earlier this monthThe developments stem from asweeping investigation Muelleris conducting into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence US politicsPapadopoulos a Trump campaign volunteer made false statements to FBI officials earlier this year when asked about contacts he had with a foreign professor according to the  The contact claimed to have high-level Russian connections that could provide dirt on then-candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails and arrange a meeting between Trump campaign officials and Russian leaders all the way up to President Vladimir PutinMany of the which include money laundering and tax fraud relate to alleged crimes that predate either of the political operatives joiningthe Trump campaignThey primarily involve the concealment of millions of dollars they made while working on behalf of apro-Putin political party in UkraineAccording to the indictment the duo also obscured the fact that they were working for a foreign government anddid not register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act as required by law Manafort and Gates both pleaded not guilty on Monday  Who are the Ukrainians and Russians for whom Manaforts firm worked And what impact might scrutiny of those connections have on Muellers wider probe That story in condensed form below starts in 2005After gaining prominence working as a political consultant in Washington for major figures including presidents Gerald Ford Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush Manaforts star faded and hefound work for authoritarian leaders in the Philippines Zaire and elsewhere In 2005 Manafort was hired by a Ukrainian steel magnate who wanted to burnish his international imageAkhmetovs company was based in a heavily industrialized mostly Russian-speaking part of eastern Ukraine He was one of a large group of Ukrainian oligarchs with close ties to the leader of the Russia-friendly Party of Regions Manafort was hired by the political party soon thereafterManafort provided image consulting to Yanukovych

The Washington Post last August when Ukrainian  showing $127millionin apparent payments to Manafort between 2007 and 2012 by Yanukovychs partyHe got Yanukovych to comb his hair better to stay on

and told them what suits to wearYanukovych was successfully elected president in 2010 In those early years in Eastern Europe Manafort also worked on projects with  a  who was then one of the worlds richest men Despite rocky patches in their business relationship Manafort  Deripaska weekly briefings on the 2016 US presidential election while serving as Trumps campaign chairman  Manaforts firm did not just work with Yanukovych on domestic politics Its lobbying on Yanukovychs behalf in Western capitals is why the lack of Foreign Agents Registration Act compliance is mentioned in Muellers indictmentIn Washington Manafort worked to promote Yanukovych as a pro-Western democrat But in 2014 Yanukovych was deposed by a popular uprising fueled by anger at his alleged corruption authoritarianism and preference for Putin over the European Union Yanukovych fled to Russia and is wanted in Ukraine on charges of high treasonThe Post has  that Ukrainian business records show that Manaforts firm did not close his business operations in the country until April 2016 the month after he joined the Trump campaign (though two months before he become its chairman)Manaforts connections in the region and their tendency to align with pro-Russian interests made his appointment as Trumps campaign chairman all the more controversial Reporting on the nature of those tiesbecame clearer just as Trump was beginning to make more and more pro-Russian comments on the campaign trail Democratic opponents became vocal about collusion allegations between Trumps campaign and the Kremlin Manaforts position became increasingly untenableand he was asked to resign in August 2016Former campaign adviser has been thrust into a national spotlight after he pleaded guilty tolying to federal investigators amid a probe into possible Russian influence in US political affairsPapadopoulos  pleaded guilty this month to lying about his involvement with people he understood had connections to the Russian governmentAs The Washington Postscourt documents released Monday show that Papadopoulos met withan unnamed overseas professor in Italy in March 2016 That same month he was nameda foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign According to the court documents Papadopoulos also reported back to campaign officials about his attempts to set up meetings between the campaign and the Russian governmentSo who is George Papadopoulos  the man  an excellent guy    The proposal sent a ripple of concern through campaign headquarters in Trump Tower Campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis wrote that he thought NATO allies should be consulted before any plans were made Another Trump adviser retired Navy Rear Adm Charles Kubic cited legal concerns including a possible violation of US sanctions against Russia and of the Logan Act which prohibits US citizens from unauthorized negotiation with foreign governmentsBut Papadopoulos a campaign volunteer with scant foreign policy experience persisted Between March and September [2016] the self-described energy consultant sent at least a half-dozen requests for Trump as he turned from primary candidate to party nominee or for members of his team to meet with Russian officials Among those to express concern about the effort was then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort who rejected in May 2016 a proposal from Papadopoulos for Trump to do soWhite House press secretary Sarah HuckabeeSanders said Monday that Papadopouloss guilty plea has nothing to do with his campaign activities  only his failure to be honest about themIt was extremely limitedSanders told reporters during a news briefing aboutPapadopouloss role in the campaign It was a volunteer positionIn June a Belarusan American businessman who goes by the name Sergei Millian shared some tantalizing claims about Donald TrumpTrump had a long-standing relationship with Russian officials Millian told an associate and those officials were now feeding Trump damaging information about his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton Millian said that the information provided to Trump had been very helpfulUnbeknownst to Millian however his conversation was not confidential His associate passed on what he had heard to a former British intelligence officer who had been hired by Trumps political opponents to gather information about the Republicans ties to RussiaThe allegations by Millian  whose role was first reported by the Wall Street Journal and has been confirmed by The Washington Post  were central to the dossier compiled by the former spy Christopher Steele While the dossier has not been verified and its claims have been denied by Trump Steeles document said that Millians assertions had been corroborated by other sources including in the Russian government and former intelligence sourcesThe most explosive allegation that the dossier says originally came from Millian is the claim that Trump had hired prostitutes at the Moscow Ritz-Carlton and that the Kremlin has kept evidence of the encounterBy his own evolving statements Sergei Millian is either a shrewd businessman with high-level access to both Trumps inner circle and the Kremlin or a bystander unwittingly caught up in a global controversyAn examination of Millians career shows he is a little of both His case lays bare the challenge facing the FBI as it investigates Russias alleged attempts to manipulate the American political system and whether Trump associates participatedIt also illustrates why the Trump administration remains unable to shake the Russia story While some of the unproven claims attributed in the dossier to Millian are bizarre and outlandish there are also indications that he had contacts with Trumps circleMillian told several people that during the campaign and presidential transition he was in touch with George Papadopoulos a campaign foreign policy adviser according to a person familiar with the matter Millian is among Papadopouloss nearly 240 Facebook friends Trump aides vehemently reject Millians claims to have had close contact with Trump or high-level access to the presidents company Millian did not answer a list of detailed questions about his interactions with Trump and his role in the Steele dossier instead responding by email with lengthy general defenses of Trumps election as Gods will and complaining that inquiries about his role are evidence of a witch hunt and McCarthyismAny falsifications deceit and baseless allegations directed against any US President is damaging to the national security interests of the United States he wrote in one email Publishing slanderous stories about the Presidents decency and offensive material about the first family is malicious propaganda and a threat to the national security in order to destabilize the integrity of the United States of America and stir civil disorder aiming at reducing its political influence in the worldIn late January Millian appeared on Russian television where he denied knowing information that could be damaging to Trump I want to say that I dont have any compromising information neither in Russia nor in the United States nor could I have he said speaking in Russian Without a doubt it is a blatant lie and an effort of some people  its definitely a group of people  to portray our president in a bad light using my nameThe dossier decried by Trump as phony stuff and fake news and derided by Russian President Vladimir Putin as rubbish consists of a series of reports compiled by Steele over the course of several months before the electionMillian identified in different portions of the dossier as Source D and Source E is described as a close associate of TrumpIn addition to the salacious allegations that gained widespread attention the dossier attributed other claims to Millian For instance Steele wrote that Millian asserted that there was a well developed conspiracy of cooperation between [Trump] and Russian leadership claiming the relationship was managed for Trump by former campaign chairman Paul Manafort A Manafort spokesman said every word in the dossier about Paul Manafort is a lieSome of those who know Millian described him as more of a big-talking schmoozer than a globe-trotting interlocutor They say hes a self-promoter with a knack for getting himself on television  like the time he appeared on a 2013 episode of the Bravo reality show Million Dollar Listing where he attempted to broker a sale with a Russian-speaking client who agreed to pay $7million in cash for a luxury New York unitHes an opportunist If he sees an opportunity he would go after it said Tatiana Osipova who was a neighbor of Millians when he lived in Atlanta and who in 2006 helped him found a trade group the Russian American Chamber of Commerce in the USA Osipova now lives in St Petersburg but has remained in touch with Millian Hes a fun guy a smart guy But always talking He talks so much s---Millians original name was Siarhei Kukuts but those who know him say he changed it because he wanted something that sounded more elegant He told ABC News in July that he changed his name to honor his grandmother whose last name he said was Millianovich He has also at times gone by the name Sergio MillianMy general impression of him was that he just wanted to be important Nobody really knew what he or the chamber were doing but he presented himself with grandeur said Nadia Diskavets a New York photographer who was also a founding member of the Russian American Chamber of Commerce but has not been in touch with Millian recently So I always took everything he said with a grain of saltAnother acquaintance referred to him in a similar way saying he exaggerated his connections with Trump and with the Russians Hes too small of a fish to deal with Russian people she said They will smell his smallness from miles awayBorn in Belarus Millian 38 attended a university in Minsk A Russian-language version of his biography that was posted on the Russian American Chamber of Commerces website says he studied to be a military translatorHe arrived in the early 2000s as a young single professional in Atlanta which has a large Russian-speaking community Friends there said he worked in real estate and according to one rsum posted online he opened a translating business whose clients included the Russian Ministry of Foreign AffairsFriends said that Millian founded the Russian American Chamber of Commerce as a way to forge business ties between the United States and Russia and as a personal networking opportunityMillians affiliation with the group also appears to have boosted his profile in Russia He hosted events in the United States and abroad on the chambers behalf and after moving to New York began being interviewed repeatedly by Russian-language news outlets as an expert on US-Russia relations He traveled to Moscow in 2011 courtesy of a Russian government cultural group later investigated by the FBI for allegedly recruiting spies though there is no evidence that the inquiry involved Millian Millians account of his relationship with Trump has shifted over time As the Republican candidate was rising in the spring of 2016 a time before there was close scrutiny of Trumps ties to Russia Millian used his media appearances to describe deep connections with the New York real estate mogulHe told the Russian state-operated news agency RIA Novosti last April for instance that he met Trump at a Miami horse-racing track after mutual associates had organized a trip for Trump to Moscow in 2007From there Millian said he entered into a business arrangement in which he says he helped market a Trump-branded condominium complex in Hollywood Fla to international investors including RussiansMillians description of the Miami event appears to match up with a picture he posted on Facebook that appears to show him posing with Trump and the projects developer Jorge Prez  the only evidence that Millian ever met TrumpA spokesman for Prez said his company has no record of paying Millian in connection with the project and Prez declined to comment furtherA White House spokeswoman said Sergei Millian is one of hundreds of thousands of people the president has had his picture made with but they do not know one anotherMillian however promoted ties he claimed to hold with Trumps companyA 2009 newsletter posted to the website of the Russian American Chamber of Commerce reported that the group had signed formal agreements with the Trump Organization and Prezs company to jointly service the Russian clients commercial residential and industrial real estate needsIn the interview with RIA Novosti Millian boasted that when he was in New York Trump introduced him to his right-hand man Michael Cohen a longtime Trump adviser  a claim that Cohen has deniedHe is the chief attorney of Trump through whom all contracts have to go Millian told the Russian news outlet adding I was involved in the signing of a contract to promote Trumps real estate projects in RussiaYou can say that I was their exclusive broker Millian continued in Russian Back then in 2007-2008 Russians by the dozens were buying apartments in Trumpsbuildings in the USAAsked in the April interview how often he spoke to Trump or his associates Millian responded The last time was several days agoMillian told people last year that he was in touch with Papadopoulos whom Trump had described in a March 2016 Washington Post editorial board interview as a member of his foreign policy team and an excellent guy Papadopoulos received attention during the campaign largely because of reports that he had exaggerated his rsum and cited among his accomplishments that he had participated in a Model United Nations program for college and graduate studentsBut according to foreign news reports and officials he conducted a number of high-level meetings last year and presented himself as a representative of the Trump campaign He told a group of researchers in Israel that Trump saw Putin as a responsible actor and potential partner according to a column in the Jerusalem Post while later he met with a British Foreign Office representative in London an embassy spokesman said He also criticized US sanctions on Russia in an interview with the Russian news outlet InterfaxPapadopoulos did not respond to questions about contacts with Millian But Papadopoulos said by email that his public comments during the campaign reflected his own opinions and that some of his energy policy views run counter to Russian interests No one from the campaign ever directed me to discuss talking points he said In a separate email he accused The Post of relying on innuendo and unsubstantiated claims by irrelevant sourcesNeither Millian nor a White House spokeswoman responded to questions about Papadopoulos The person familiar with the contacts who spoke on the condition of anonymity did not provide details  Over the summer as Trump prepared to accept the Republican presidential nomination Millian traveled to Russia He posted pictures on his Facebook page showing that he attended a Russian government-sponsored summit in St Petersburg in June One photograph shows him with Russias minister for energy Another shows him chatting with Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska who is close to Putin A spokeswoman for Deripaska declined to comment A spokesman for the Russian Embassy did not respond to questions about MillianLater in the summer Millian continued boasting of his Trump connectionsHe told ABC News that he had been the official broker for the Trump-branded condo building and described Trumps affinity for working with Russians He pointed to hundreds of millions of dollars that [Trump] received from interactions with Russian businessmenMillian added that Trump likes Russia because he likes beautiful Russian ladies  talking to them of course And he likes to be able to make lots of money with RussiansMillian told ABC that he was absolutely not involved with Russian intelligence But when asked whether he had heard rumors to that effect Millian replied Yes of courseMillian also said that at times he talked about US politics with top Russian officials Usually if I meet top people in the Russian government they invite me say to the Kremlin for the reception of course I have a chance to talk to some presidential advisers and some top people Millian saidWhile Cohen has said he has never met Millian the two did interact last year over Twitter Millian was for a time one of about 100 people that Cohen followed and they tweeted at each other on one occasion in August after Cohen appeared on televisionCohen later unfollowed Millian telling The Post that he had mistakenly thought Millian was related to a Trump Organization employee with a similar last nameHe is a total phony Cohen said in an interview Anything coming out of this individuals mouth is inaccurate and purely part of some deranged interest in having his name in the newspaperCohen said he did not believe Trump was in Russia in 2007 as Millian claimed in AprilCohen said it was possible that like other brokers in Florida Millian might have attempted to sell units at Trump Hollywood But he said Millian never held an exclusive deal at the project or any contract with the Trump OrganizationSpeaking with The Post over the phone from his New York office in a January interview Cohen also read aloud from a lengthy email he said Millian had sent him shortly before the election that contradicted his earlier public statementsI met Mr Trump once long time ago in 2008 pretty much for a photo opportunity and a brief talk as part of my marketing work for Trump Hollywood after my brokering service was signed Now to say that I have substantial ties is total nonsense Cohen said reading from an email he said Millian wrote after media coverage that mentioned himIn the email Millian suggested holding a news conference to clear up the matter Cohen said Cohen said he rejected the idea accusing Millian via email of seeking media attention off of this false narrative of a Trump-Russia alliance despite having met Trump only one time for a 10 second photo opCohen who left his job at the Trump Organization in January to become Trumps personal attorney said this month that he could not release a copy of Millians email because he no longer has access to the companys email systemIn South Florida where Millian claimed to have had a contract to sell units at Trump Hollywood there is little evidence that he played a major roleDaniel Lebensohn whose company BH3 took over for the Related Group in 2010 after Prezs company struggled to complete the project said his companys records show no sign that Millian sold any units in the buildingTwo Florida-based real estate brokers who specialize in the Russian market and have sold units in Trump Hollywood were equally mystifiedIve never heard of him said Olga Mirer who has traveled back and forth to Russia over the past decade brokering deals at Trump Hollywood and other Florida buildingsDespite the Trump teams efforts to distance the president from Millian the dossier source nevertheless attended Trumps inauguration in JanuaryHe posted photos of himself on Facebook attending VIP events for supporters including one in which he posed in front of the podium at a reception for Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus at Trumps Washington hotel A White House official did not address a question about Millians attendance Alice Crites in Washington and David Filipov in Moscow contributed to this reportNewly released court documents show that Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos communicated with several senior campaign officials about his outreach to the Russian government over a period of months The recipients of Papadopouloss emails are not named in the filings but The Washington Post has identified several individuals based on interviews and other documents Papadopoulos this month to lying to federal agents about his outreach to Russia   Victoria Toensing an attorney for Sam Clovis confirmed that several references in court filings to the campaign supervisor refer to the onetime radio host from Iowa who served as Trumps national campaign co-chairmanAt one point Papadopoulos emailed Clovis and other campaign officials about a March 24 2016 meeting he had in London with a professor who had introduced him to the Russian ambassador and a Russian woman he described as Putins niece The group had talked about arranging a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss US-Russia ties under President Trump Papadopoulos wrote (Papadopoulos later learned that the woman was not Putins niece and while he expected to meet the ambassador he never did according to filings)Clovis responded that he would work it through the campaign adding great work according to court documentsIn August 2016 Clovis responded to efforts by Papadopoulos to organize an off the record meeting with Russian officials I would encourage you and another foreign policy adviser to the campaign to make the trip if it is feasible Clovis wroteToensing said Clovis always vigorously opposed any Russian trip for Donald Trump and/or the campaign She said his responses to Papadopoulos were courtesy by a polite gentleman from Iowa  Emails previously described to The Post indicate that the high-ranking campaign official described in court documents is onetime campaign manager Corey Lewandowski The emails were among more than 20000 pages that the Trump campaign turned over to congressional committees after review by White House and defense lawyersLewandowski who was pushed out of his post in June 2016 did not respond to requests for commentPapadopoulos wrote to Lewandowski several times to let him know that the Russians were interested in forging a relationship with the campaign court filings showIn one email on April 27 2016 Papadopoulos wrote to discuss Russias interest in hosting Mr TrumpHave been receiving a lot of calls over the last month about Putin wanting to host him and the team when the time is right he addedIn May Papadopoulos forwarded to Lewandowski an offer of cooperation from a Russian with links to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Is this something we want to move forward with he askedThere is no indication if or how Lewandowski responded to those messages But in June when Papadopoulos emailed him again about Russia Lewandowski referred him to Clovis because he is running point according to court documents    The court filings indicate that Papadopoulos emailed another high-ranking campaign official on May 21 2016 with the subject line Request from Russia to meet Mr TrumpThe Post has previously identified this official as Paul Manafort who was indicted Monday on unrelated criminal chargesManafort forwarded Papadopouloss email to another campaign official stating We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips referring to a trip to Russia It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signalManafort spokesman Jason Maloni in Augustthat the campaign chairmans response indicated that any invitation by Russia directly or indirectly would be rejected outright  The Post has previously identified the official who received the May 21 2016 email from Manafort as his deputy Rick Gates Gates was indicted Monday on unrelated criminal charges  The court filings indicate that on April 27 2016 Papadopoulos emailed a senior policy advisor and wrote Have some interesting messages coming in from Moscow about a trip when the time is rightThe Post has not identified this official  Court filings indicate that Clovis told Papadopoulos that he would encourage him and another foreign policy adviser to the campaign to make a trip to meet with Russian officials if is feasible Emails previously reviewed by the Post show that the other person to whom Clovis was referring was Trump foreign policy adviser Walid Phares who has worked as a Fox News commentatorRebecca Bynum a spokeswoman for Phares said Phares had met Papadopoulos only once at a March 31 2016 meeting of Trumps national security advisers a group that included both men She said Phares never traveled with Papadopoulos did not have any conversations with him about making such trips and had been unaware until this week that Clovis had mentioned his name I think Clovis was just trying to get [Papadopoulos] out of his hair she said  According to emails previously described to The Post the London-based professor who was a key contact for Papadopoulos in his Russian outreach is  who formerly served as a government official in MaltaMifsud did not respond to a request for comment Monday In an email to The Post in August he wrote that he had absolutely no contact with the Russian government and said his only ties to Russia were through academic linksPapadopoulos met Mifsud in March 2016 while traveling in Italy according to court records The professor seemed uninterested in Papadopoulos until he learned that he was a campaign adviser according to court filingsFive days after Trump named Papadopoulos as one of his advisers during a meeting at The Post Papadopoulos and Mifsud met in London The professor brought with him a Russian woman who was introduced as a relative of President Vladimir Putin who had connections to senior Russian government officialsThe following month Mifsud told Papadopoulos that he had just returned from Moscow where he had learned from high-level Russian government officials that Russia had dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton including thousands of emails  Court documents show that Papadopoulos corresponded with a female Russian national whom he initially believed was Putins nieceAt one point she wrote to him The Russian Federation would love to welcome [Trump] once his candidature would be officially announcedThe Post has not identified the woman  In April 2016 Mifsud introduced Papadopoulos over email to a man in Moscow who told Papadopoulos that he had connections to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs court records showEmails previously described to The Post indicate that the man is Ivan Timofeev a program director at a Russian government-funded think tank called the Russian International Affairs CouncilPapadopoulos communicated via Skype and email with Timofeev to discuss establishing ties between Russian officials and the Trump campaignOn Monday Timofeev declined to comment referring a reporter to a statement the Russian International Affairs Council posted in August in response to a Post story The statement said that Papadopoulos had contacted the council and put forth the idea of a possible visit to Russia by Mr Trump or his team membersGiven the RIACs established practice of hosting public meetings with prominent politicians and public figures from the US and other countries the US initiative was a matter of routine for the Council the statement said pointing out that among the councils guest speakers was former US ambassador Michael McFaulTimofeev told The Post in August that the idea of a meeting with Trump officials was dropped after he received no official request from the Trump campaign for a meeting David Filipov in Moscow Karla Adam in London and Tom Hamburger and Robert Costa in Washington contributed to this reportGiven how angry Beijing gets about THAAD you may be forgiven for thinking that the US missile system deployed to South Korea is primarily aimed at China However Washington and Seoul have justified the system by saying it is necessary to defend South Korea from North Korean aggressionWith the missile system finally being deployed and tensions between the Koreas and China exploding again heres a guide to the controversyThe acronym stands forTerminal High Altitude Area Defense The ground-based missile defense system which first came into development after the Persian Gulf War is designed to shoot down short- medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles during the terminal phase (ie when they are coming down)According to  the US company that manufacturers the system there are four stages to its operation First a radar system identifies the incoming threat then the target is identified and engaged An interceptor is fired from a truck-mounted launcher which destroysthe missile using kinetic energy Because the incoming missile is destroyed at a high altitude the effects of weapons of mass destruction can be mitigated with the deviceThe system is designed to be highly mobile and it consists of four main components atruck-mounted launcher eight interceptors on the launcher a transportable radar system and a fire control system that links the various components with external command centersTHAAD systems have been deployedin a number of places around the world including Guam and Hawaii However last year the Defense Department announced it would deploy a system to  where it would be operated by US forces stationed in the country In a statement the Pentagon described the move as a defensive measure against North Korea after the country continued to pursue nuclear weapons and tested a number of ballistic missile systemsThis week the situation on the Korean Peninsula escalated dramatically On Tuesday North Korean  that the country has practiced attempts to hit US military bases in Japan with a number of recently launched missiles The number of missiles fired suggested that North Korea was training to see how quickly it could set up its extended-range missiles in a wartime settingThat same day the United States announced that it has begun deploying THAAD to  While the land where the system is due to be deployed is not ready yet the equipment will be kept at a US air base in Osan until the site is prepared Full deployment is expected as early as JuneThe news of the THAAD deployment sparked a threat of consequences from China I want to emphasize that we firmly oppose the deployment of THAAD said Geng Shuang a spokesman for Chinas Foreign Ministry at a  on Tuesday We will resolutely take necessary measures to defend our security interestsOn the surface of it it may be hard to understand Beijings fury with THAAD For one thing its a purely defensive system THAAD systems dont carry warheads relying onthe force of the interceptor to destroy the incoming missile rather than a detonation And while in theory the system could be used to intercept Chinese ballistic missiles it would only work on missiles in their terminal phase ruling out those targeting the United States which would still beascendingMoreover while China is well-known as a key ally and big brother of North Korea it has shown itself to be exasperated by Pyongyangs recent missile launches Beijing recently  striking a major blow to the isolated nations economyInstead many experts argue that Chinas anger over THAAD has less to do with the missiles than with the sophisticated radar capabilities included in the system These radars couldbe used to track Chinas own missile systems potentially giving the United Statesa major advantage in any future conflict with China Some Chinese analysts argue that THAAD itself is of only limited use against North Korea anyway as it would not be able to take out short-range missiles and artillery that do not reach high altitudes hinting that the radar may be the real reason for the deploymentMore broadly Beijing is concerned that the United States is hoping to use both South Korea and Japan to contain China in the future If South Korea insists on becoming a US puppet China will have to act against it the nationalist state newspaper Global Times wrote in an Chinesereaction appears to be moving to hurt South Korea economically Beijing has already on Korean businesses that operate in China including shutting down stores of Lotte a South Korean conglomerate that offered a golf course as land for THAAD useMore measures are expected Chinese travel agencies are stopping the sale of tickets to South Korea and there have been growing calls in China to boycott South Korean products and even cancel tours by K-pop stars Such moves carry significant weightSouth Korea has grown increasingly dependent economically on China in recent years Chinais South Koreas largest trading partner and the  to the country were $142 billion in 2014 more than twice the value of its exports to the United StatesChinese pressure also comes at a time of political transition in South Korea Scandal has sidelined PresidentPark Geun-hye who is expected to find out this week whether she will be impeached And Moon Jae-in the leading liberal candidate to replace her has suggested he may reconsider the THAAD deploymentDuring last years presidential campaign Donald Trump spoke frequently of the threat posed by North Korea and suggested he may lean on China which he said had total control over North Korea However since taking office in January the new US president has been uncharacteristically mute on the subject despite provocations from Pyongyang This has left many North Korea-watchers wondering what exactly his eventual policy will beThe deployment of THAAD seems to be one of the first real moves against North Korea though it was largely a continuation of policies undertaken by President Barack Obama The backlash from China and various dramatic moves by North Korea however show that the situation is complicatedA mere 14 inches of snow has fallen the entire winter in Washington If everything comes together just right we could increase that total by many multiples Monday night But the further south and east you go in the region the less certain significant snow becomesModel forecasts on Saturday evening generally suggested very significant snow will fall Monday night in the metro region away from Southern Maryland and could even reach double digits However nagging questions about how heavy the precipitation will be and where the rain-snow line will set up remainBased on the latest information we think a general 5-10 inches seems like a reasonable first call for snowfall amounts in the immediate metro with more to the north and northeast and less to the south and southeastBelow find the stream of updates from our evening live blog session which informed this snowfall forecast Looking at all of the models (granted the European is still to come out) I am impressed with what the GFS Canadian and UKMet models are collectively conveying A classic snowstorm for the DC area with a strong area of low pressure developing near Cape Hatteras and tracking to a position off the Delmarva Tuesday morning The models all agree the storm will pass through relatively quickly but also produce heavy snow I think some of the precipitation amounts they are simulating are probably overdone but even cutting them by 25-50 percent would still produce substantial snowfallThe NAM model with its razor sharp rain-snow line cutting through the immediate metro area is a concern But I am mostly discounting it as it is not supported by the other models and also is not particularly good with forecasts beyond 36 hours Having said that especially as its March we need to pay close attention to temperatures because if the other models are too cold and temperatures dont fall as forecast with the snow amounts will fall well short of their potentialA reasonable first forecast is for about 5-10 inches of snow in the immediate metro area and lesser amounts to the south and southeast and greater amounts to the north and northeastSee our first accumulation map which could well need altering Sunday just above this updateConsider that small changes in the forecast track on Sunday would mean major changes to these numbersWell have a fresh forecast up at 6 am Sunday and then a detailed storm update out before noon after reviewing the next big set of model forecastsRemember to adjust your clocks forward to tonight  Thanks for joining us Im about to wrap things up for the night but have one more update in which Ill try to synthesize what Ive seen this evening Look for it in about 20 minutes The UKMet model is in which while lesser known is actually the second best-performer behind the famed European model We dont have great maps for this model but the simulation we see looks more or less consistent with the GFS and Canadian in terms of the storm track  which is a favorable one for significant snow in Washington At 8 am Tuesday the storm is centered off the Delmarva Coast and the model shows heavy precipitation having fallen see image below The Canadian model snowfall totals from DC to Boston are obscene in the 15-20 inch range and I think probably overdone at least in our region For one I dont think the storm will intensify fast enough to deliver that amount of snow in Washington in under 12 hours Secondly that amount of snow has no historic precedent at this time of year Third it is generally the worst performing model Finally not all of the snow it simulates will stickHaving said all of that it does have some support from the GFS model which to me means you at least have to consider the possibility of double digits totals in our area Belowa visualization of the storm from the Canadian model Its eerily similar to the GFS Snow begins just before 8 pm Monday in the metro region quickly becomes and heavy and pastes the region overnight It does not mix with rain or sleet in this model and is a classic track for heavy snow from Cape Hatteras to a position east of the Delmarva The storm then exits quickly Tuesday morning The Canadian model forecast for Monday night just in has a lot in common with the GFS It keeps the rain-snow line well east of Interstate 95 and dumps a ton of snow in the immediate DC area Graphics coming in a few The fun is not over yet The Canadian model is in Looking at it now and will have comments in a few minutes How much snow are we talking about if the GFS model is right Assuming temperatures are at or below freezing for most of the storm and rain or sleet doesnt mix with the snow the numbers are mind-bogglingIt suggests the immediate metro area would get 10-15 inches of snow and our northern suburbs would see 15-20 inches  all in the course of about 12 hours This would be a historic storm if that comes to passA couple caveats 1) This model sometimes over-predicts the amount of precipitation in these kinds of storms 2) Some of the snow that fell initially would probably melt (or be wasted) due to temperatures above freezing for a timeas well as above freezing ground temperatureBelow is a simulation of the storm from the GFS model The storm moves into Washington around 8 pm Monday night and is on its way out by around 8 am Tuesday morning But in that time the model suggests it unloads A LOT of snow The GFS model is in and snow lovers in the Washington region will like it Its a cold snowy forecast Once the precipitation begins Monday evening temperatures quickly fall to 32 degrees or lower and the rain-snow line is a good deal east of Interstate 95 The model produces over 14 inches of liquid equivalent in Washington which would convert to a lot of snow given the models temperature forecast Ill post some graphics shortly The GFS model is flowing in right now so well have some comments on it in the next few minutesWhile this storm will impact DC it could be a much bigger deal to our northeast If you have travel plans in New England Tuesday into early Wednesday expect there to be disruptions Look at this forecast for snowfall amounts over the entire Northeastern US it is impressiveWidespread totals of at least a foot are expected from eastern Pennsylvania to eastern Massachusetts In addition to the two versions of the NAM model discussed below there is actually a third one  run at even a higher resolution (3 kilometers) which we call the NAM 3K It has a forecast product which shows how much snow will fall each hour and its forecast of the snowfall in the hour ending at 4 am Tuesday morning is fascinatingFirst of all notice how sharply the snow cuts off just east of Interstate 95 But then notice how heavy the snow is west of Interstate 95  ripping at the rate of 1 to 2 inches per hourThis one graphic shows why the the location of the rain-snow line will be so important in this storm and how small deviations could have huge implications for the forecast For snow lovers depressed by the NAM model simulation just shown I should point out an alternative version of this model is run at a higher resolution and is colder and snowier than its low-resolution version Rather than the rain-snow line hovering west of Washington throughout this event it straddles the Interstate 95 corridor in the high-resolution NAM and would give DC and its close-in suburbs more snow than low-resolution NAM forecastsIts forecast suggests at least 2 to 4 inches of snow in the regionCompare that to the low-resolution NAM which only suggests 1-2 inches in the immediate metro though a bit more to the north and west Below isa NAM model radar simulation of Monday nights storm If youre snow lover along and east of Interstate 95 you may not want to look as it would be your worst case scenario Basically it shows the rain-snow line west of the Beltway for a large part of the event which would mean mostly rain or a rain-snow mix near the city and points east It even suggests our nearby western suburbs could have a good deal of mixingThis is not a good model forecast if you like snow except perhaps if you live north and west of Leesburg and FrederickBut remember what I wrote in my 931 pm update were outside the range at which this model is considered pretty reliable  so you can take it with a grain of salt That said if the GFS running in about 30 minutes is similar then its time to worry The NAM model is in and produces a good deal of precipitation  around 1-14 inches liquid equivalent which would convert to a healthy amount of snow if all the precipitation falls as snow and doesnt mix with rain But there are a few red flags for snow lovers in this run 1) Precipitation starts off as rain in Washington and doesnt change to snow until potentially after midnight 2) It is a relatively short duration event less than 12 hours The precipitation starts around 8 pm and is all over between 6 and 8 am 3) The model tends to have a wet bias and sometimes simulates too much precipitationIll show some graphics in my next update One thing this storm will have going for it if you like snow is a strong area of cold high pressure to the north and northwest The presence of this high pressure is critical for supplying sufficient amounts of cold air for snow to fallSome of you may recall the March 6 2013 Snowquester storm in which large amounts of snow were forecast but didnt materialize In that case there was no cold high pressure system to the north  which shouldve been a big warning sign for forecasters As we await the NAM model which is just starting to come in we want to note that this model usually performs best within about 24-36 hours of a storm event As were about 48 hours away from this still were a little outside its best range  so take our reports on this model with a grain of salt In addition to producing a most likely snowfall forecast (see our first update from 850 pm) the National Weather Service now also issues forecasts for low-end and high-end possibilities For this particular storm in Washington its low-end forecast is 3 inches and its high-end forecast is 13 inches Thats quite a range but we think its a reasonable assessment given the complexity of the forecastThe potential minimum and maximums (min left max right)Literally the potential for 3 or 13 at DC (this will get narrowed in)  TerpWeather (@TerpWeather)  Normally at this time the NAM model would be coming in so we could discuss it But there appear to be some delays at the National Weather Service (which runs this model) Well hopefully be able to start writing about it shortly To illustrate how close DC may be to the rain-snow line Monday night lets look at this (admittedly crude) representation of it from the SREF model (described below) The animation below shows three snapshots of the rain-snow line Monday night into Tuesday morning at 11 pm 2 am and 5 amNotice how the District goes from snow to rain to snow The rain-snow line sets up right along Interstate 95 If youre north and west of it this group of models suggests you have a good chance to stay all snow But along it and especially to the south and east rain could mix in it times The first model well look at this evening is actually an average of a group of models known as the Short-range Ensemble Forecast System or SREF This group of models suggests the region will experience plenty of precipitation Monday night into Tuesday the equivalent of 1 to 15 inches of rainOf course were expecting the majority of this precipitation to fall as snow Typically an inch of rain equates to about ten inches of snow But because Monday nights snow will be heavy and wet we might expect one inch of rain to equate to about seven inches of snow in the immediate metro area Even with that assumption when you do the math this model is predicting the potential for a lot of snow  with double digit totals possible in some areasA limitation of this model group is that some of the individual models which comprise it sometimes produce precipitation totals that are unrealistically high So its possible the amounts it is suggesting are slightly overdone To get us started lets take a look at the National Weather Service snow accumulation forecast The map below which was released at 810 pm predicts widespread totals of 4 to 10 inches with amounts increasing from southeast to northwest The highest amounts are north and west of the Beltway and a few spots in northern Maryland are predicted to exceed a foot The lowest totals are in southern Maryland where one to four inches or less are expectedTheres never a great time to fire off rockets potentially capable of carrying nuclear warheads but China has been left in an awkward position by the timing of North Koreas latest ballistic missile test experts said Pyongyang said Monday that this weekends test of the medium- to long-range missile had been  according to the official KCNA news agency But there was probably a collective groan in BeijingThe missile launch took place while President Trump was playing host to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and it will intensify pressure on China from both their countries to do more to restrain North Koreas nuclear ambitions The United States and Japan along with South Korea requested an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council in New York on Monday night to discussthe incident Russias Foreign Ministry also expressed concern the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reportedChinas Foreign Ministry said Monday that it opposed the test with spokesman Geng Shuang telling reporters that his government would take a constructive and responsible part in the discussions at the United NationsThe missile test was conducted just as Sino-US relations were beginning to look up a few days after Trump held what the White House said was an extremely cordial  with Chinese President Xi Jinping But Trump has made clear in the past that he does not think China is doing enough to rein in its ally in Pyongyang Zhang Liangui a Korea expert at Beijings Central Party School which trains Communist Party officials said the timing was well thought through by Pyongyang to undermine Chinas ties with the United StatesIt clearly intended to affect the development of Sino-US relations Zhang said But what matters is how China and the United States handle itThe test also came as China campaigns hard against US plans to deploy the anti-missile Terminal High Altitude Aerial Defense (THAAD) system to South Korea which Beijing considers a threat to its security  It was a timely reminder to the Trump administration of why those missile defense plans are important but also experts said to the candidates in this years presidential election in South Korea where public opinion on the issue is dividedThere was opposition in South Korea to the THAAD deployment said Cui Zhiying a Korean affairs expert at Tongji University But after the missile test I fear these opposition voices will be greatly diminishedIn an editorial Monday the official English-language  the missile test provided a good excuse for the United States and its military allies to step up their cooperationAs usual Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng argued that the cause of North Koreas nuclear program was its dispute with the United States and called on all relevant parties to refrain from provoking each other and escalating tensions in the regionChina has long said that dialogue and consultation are the only way forward but the Obama administration had refused to talk unless North Korea first pledged to denuclearizeIn an  Monday Chinas nationalist Global Times newspaper called North Koreas nuclear weapon and ballistic missile program a severe annoyance for Northeast Asia but also said that Pyongyang faces a very real military threat as well as harsh sanctionsWe can imagine the level of its upset and rage it said If Washington keeps cracking down on Pyongyangs nuclear development while turning a blind eye to North Koreas concerns their current confrontation will develop into an absurd struggle  Earlier in the day  to take stronger action against North Korea after the missile test the first conducted by Pyongyang since Trump took office It said the test had improved the ability of Kim Jong Uns government to put a nuclear warhead on a missileAs a permanent member of the Security Council and chair of the six-party talks and as a country that accounts for 90 percent of North Koreas trade Chinas role is extremely important said Yoshihide Suga Japans chief cabinet secretary according to Bloomberg News As the government well continue to push China for constructive involvement at various levelsBefore taking office Trump  North Korea from acquiring the capability to strike the United States with a nuclear weapon In a joint appearance over the weekend Abe called the test absolutely intolerable and Trump said he stands by Japan 100 percentChina is North Koreas primary ally and accounts for more than 70 percent of its trade as well as providing food and energy aid Although it has supported limited sanctions by the Security Council it is reluctant to take firm economic action that could destabilize the regimeNorth Korea has conducted five nuclear tests including two last year although its claims of being able to mount a nuclear warhead on a missile have never been verified independently Kim said in his New Year speech that the North was close to test-launching an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) potentially threatening the continental United States which is about 5500 miles from North KoreaChina is unlikely to support tougher punishment for North Korea unless and until it tests an ICBM or a nuclear weapon said Euan Graham director of the International Security Program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney But he added that the latest test which appeared to be the second outing for a missile that could be fired from a submarine was a fairly significant step up the ladder and could threaten US bases in Asia Luna Lin and Xin Jin contributed to this reportThe independent investigation into Trump-Russia collusion just made its most serious move since it began in May Three former campaign officials have been charged with crimes one has pleaded guilty President Trumps former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his former business partner Rick Gateswith12 counts of financial crimes related to their work in Ukraine over the past decadeAnd thespecial counsel announced that Trumps foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos  earlier this month to giving false statements to the FBI about his ties to aRussian-connected professor who promised dirt on Hillary ClintonNothing to see here Trump said of the newsSorry but this is years ago before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign But why arent Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Also there is NO COLLUSION Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) But those definitive statements are very hard to make since legal experts say this is very likely to be the beginning not the end of the probe by special counsel Robert S Mueller III And no collusion is not ruled outWhile the White House could say thatthese indictments dont advance the collusionnarrative they dont negate it either said Ira Matetsky a partner at New York City-based Ganfer and Shore law firmHere are some ofTrumps common claims about the investigation  and why the facts dont necessarily back them up yetIt is now commonly agreed after many months of COSTLY looking that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump Was collusion with HC Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Trumps main argument here is that the FBI in some form or another has been looking into this for more than a year and that because it hasnt come to a conclusion about collusion there must be noneIts true that the Manafort and Gates indictment doesnt mention the Trump campaign and refers to alleged crimes over the past decadeBut that doesnt mean the probe is over He could indict Manafort or anyone else of collusion-connected crimes any time he has evidence to do so said Jens David Ohlin a vice dean at Cornell Law UniversityYou cant rule out that [Mueller] didnt rule out Manafort colluding with Russia Ohlin saidWe do know hes also looking into Donald Trump Jrs meetings withKremlin-connected Russians whether the president obstructed justice when James Comey was the FBI director and Mueller wouldnt have hired 16 17 people to investigate these events just to indict some tangential person unrelated to the campaignsaid white-collar lawyer Jeffrey JacobovitzThe timing of the indictments is noteworthy too In just five months Muellers team has impaneled a federal grand jury and now is charging Trumps former campaign chairman Those are both significant escalationsNor has Congress dropped its investigation into collusionEarlier this month top Senate Republican and Democratic investigators that after eight months of investigating hundreds of hours of interviews with more than 100 people and nearly 100000 pages of documents they arent ready to rule out collusionTranslation At the very least accusations that the Trump campaign worked with Russia are not a hoax Its worth significant time and resources forthree committees in Congress and one independent investigation to continue to look into on a variety of frontsManafort and Gates are charged with something that does not seem directly related to Russia collusion and Trump has used that fact to argue that this has nothing to do with his campaignExcept Trump may be getting out ahead of himself Many legal experts think Mueller is putting pressure on these outside figures to get them to cooperateby sharing what they know about Trumps inner circle If true that would explain the FBI knocking on Manaforts door in or the special counsel   CAnd then we get to Papadopoulos His guilty plea is directly related to Russia in that he gave false statements to the FBI about his interaction with a Russian-connected professor during the campaign Muellerchose to telegraph on Monday thathe has someone on the inside of Trump world advising him which legal experts said underscores that this is far from overSome of Trumps allies have  between the prosecutors Mueller has hired and their ties to Democrats Since Muellers team is operating behind closed doors its been hard to directly rebut thatBut that logic falls into a gaping hole with this indictment Mueller has persuaded a federal judge to set up a grand jury he has presented the evidence his team has found and that independent grand jury decided to return an indictmentThis is out of Muellers hands Jacobovitz said Its an independent jury They could have declined the indictment but apparently they did notIts a first step and it could be one of many he saidFive million public school students in Texas will begin using new social studies textbooks this fall based on state academic standards that barely address racial segregation The states guidelines for teaching American history also do not mention the Ku Klux Klan or Jim Crow lawsAnd when it comes to the Civil War children are supposed to learn that the conflict was caused by sectionalism states rights and slavery  written deliberately in that order to telegraph slaverys secondary role in driving the conflict according to some members of the state board of educationSlavery was a side issue to the Civil War said Pat Hardy a Republican board member when the board adopted the standards in 2010 There would be those who would say the reason for the Civil War was over slavery No It was over states rightsThe killings of nine black parishioners in a South Carolina church last month sparked a broad backlash against the  to some a symbol of Southern heritage but to others a divisive sign of slavery and racismThere is also a call to reexamine a quieter but just as contentious aspect of the Civil War in American society  how the history of the war so central to our nations understanding of itself is presented in public school classrooms and textbooksIts the obvious question it seems to me Not only are we worried about the flags and statues and all that but what the hell are kids learning said Dan Quinn of the Texas Freedom Network a left-leaning advocacy organization that has been critical of the states academic standards in social studiesIf teaching history is how society shows younger generations who they are and where they came from the Civil War presents  especially because of the fundamental differences in the way the cause of the war is perceived 150years after its last battle  Nowhere is the rejection of slaverys central role more apparent than in Texas where elected members of the state board of education to correct for what they said was a liberal slantStudents in Texas are required to read the  Jefferson Davis gave when he was inaugurated president of the Confederate States of America an address that does not mention slavery But students are not required to read a famous by Alexander Stephens Daviss vice president in which he explained that the Souths desire to preserve slavery was the cornerstone of its new government and the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution Rod Paige a Republican who served as education secretary under President George W Bush was among those who criticized the Texas board for minimizing difficult parts of the nations pastIm of the view that the history of slavery and civil rights are dominant elements of our history and have shaped who we are today Paige told the board at the time according to the  We may not like our history but its historyHistorians acknowledge that disagreements over states rights played a role in the Civil War But the states rights issue was inseparable from slavery they say The right that states in the South were seeking to protect after all was the right to buy and sell peopleSouthern states made that clear in their declarations of independence from the union said James Grossman the executive director of the American Historical Association Slaverys primary role in driving the Civil War is a matter of scholarly consensus he saidThe War happened only because of the determination of the leadership of eleven states to defend the right of their residents to own other human beings Grossman wrote in an e-mail The Civil War was fought over the issue of slaveryHardy the Texas state board member who said the war was not about slavery did not respond to requests for comment The boards chair Donna Bahorich also did not respond to a request for commentQuinn of the Texas Freedom Network said the new textbooks that will arrive in Texas classrooms this fall manage to thread the needle meeting state standards while still acknowledging the importance of slaveryBut the books muddy things by presenting sectionalism and states rights ideas throughout he said A lot of white southerners have grown up believing that the Confederacys struggle was somehow a noble cause rather than a war in the defense of a horrific institution that enslaved millions of human beings are more politicized than any other state said Jeremy A Stern a historian who  for the conservative-leaning Thomas B Fordham Institute in 2011 He gave Texass standards a D and wrote that the board was molding the telling of the past to justify its current viewsStern said the  where the Civil War started and where in June Dylann Roof allegedly gunned down nine black parishioners  deserve an A and honestly address slaverys role in the conflict while also nodding to states rights as an important issue at the time Are Southern states soft-pedaling the Civil War By and large the answer to that would be no Stern said But he said there is often a difference between state standards and what children actually learnFor decades some Southerners have emphasized states rights as the cause of the war Nearly half of Americans  48percent  believe that states rights was the main cause of the war compared to 38 percent who said the main cause was slavery according to a 2011  Raul Cevallos a 2015 graduate of Texas Tech University said he was taught at his Dallas-area high school that the war was caused by slavery But he said a group he founded to create political awareness last year found that many young people are ignorant about historyThe group asked students three simple questions about the United States including Who won the Civil War for a video that later went viral online The Confederates answered one student The South said another Others said theyre werent sure But the same students answered questions about pop culture  Who is married to Brad Pitt  correctlyIf you dont know about the Civil War and you dont know about things like slavery then you wouldnt really be able to understand why our society is the way it is today Cevallos said  a sociologist who wrote the best-selling book  says textbooks perpetuate myths about the Civil War in order to avoid offending state textbook-adoption panels Nineteen states including almost all of those in the South adopt textbooks at the state level according to the Association of American PublishersI think we are at last seeing the de-Confederatization of America Loewen said And Im hoping that we will see some action towards de-Confederatizing our textbooksLoewen who has reviewed many textbooks said he has found many errors and omissions that help de-emphasize the role slavery played in causing the war Among the biggest and most common problems he said is textbooks failure to quote from key primary sources the Southern states declarations of secession which made clear that they were leaving the union to protect white citizens right to own slavesOur position is clearly identified with the institution of slavery reads signed in 1861Loewen identified one textbook   in print for more than half a century  that quoted directly from South Carolinas secession document Thats admirable Loewen said but the quotation leaves out the documents direct language about the role of slavery in driving South Carolinas decisionHistory can be a weapon Loewen said and it has been used against all of us It makes us all stupid about the past and thoughtless about the present    a Stanford professor emeritus and Pulitzer Prize-winning historian who co-authored American Pageant said Loewen is nitpickingI would defy anybody who read our text to conclude that we were unaware of slavery as the cause of the Civil War Kennedy said He added that he and his co-author have bade farewell in the past to states that found the textbooks content objectionable Alabama has rejected the book for years because of what state officials consider derogatory portrayals of 19th century religious revivals among other reasonsWere not in the business of compromising our view of history so some state school board will be happy Kennedy saidPublishers of other textbooks also pushed back against Loewens criticisms Current titles for middle and high school students clearly state that the Southern states desire to preserve slavery was the primary reason for secession said Laura Gamble a spokeswoman for PearsonCritics of Texass new history standards fear that their teaching about the Civil War will spread to other states via textbooks that cater to the Lone Star state Texas is the second-largest market in the countryBut that narrative appears to be changing as digital books help publishers become more nimble said Jay Diskey of the Association of American PublishersA spokesman for the publisher McGraw-Hill Education asked whether the company changes Civil War-related passages in books used outside Texas said the company provides content that is tailored to the educational standards of statesStephen Wright an eighth-grade teacher in Nacogdoches a small and conservative East Texas town said some Texas students undoubtedly leave their classrooms believing that slavery was not the primary cause of the Civil War But not his studentsWright said he has his students read the Southern state declarations of secession to learn for themselves what the war was about He deals with the Civil War standards  he has to teach the standards because they might show up on the states history test  by explaining the reasons that some people believe the war happenedMan its all about slavery he said The students know thatThe  and  are both reporting that members of Donald Trumps campaign spoke with Russia frequently during the campaignIts worth noting that their reporting includes significant caveats Most importantly its not clear these discussions involved the campaign The Times says the contacts were with Russian intelligence officials while CNN says it was with Russian nationals known to US intelligence And as the Times notes it is not unusual for American businessmen to come in contact with foreign intelligence officials sometimes unwittingly in countries like Russia and Ukraine where the spy services are deeply embedded in societySo basically conclusions that this proves collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government are premature That claim is based on the preponderance of evidence rather than any real conclusive  and even anonymously sourced  reportingBut importantlythe new reportsseem to contradict claims the Trump campaign and now the Trump White House have made about their lack of contact with Russia They have said in various ways that there was no contact on multiple occasions and as recently as Tuesday afternoonTrump reportedly denied any campaign-season contact between those close to him and Russia after a mid-January news conference After being asked about it at the end of the conference he didnt answer the question Reporters chased him down afterward at whichpoint and ABCs Cecilia Vega Trump flatly denied any contact between his associates or his campaign and RussiaFortunately ABCs Cecilia Vega asked my question about whether any Trump associates contacted Russians Trump said no Jim Acosta (@Acosta)   you must have missed the part of my reporting that said trump came back and answered my first question with a firm no  Cecilia Vega (@CeciliaVega) White House press secretary Sean Spicer was asked Tuesday  before the explosive reports came out  if that was still the company line He didnt amend itQUESTION Back in January the president said that nobody in his campaign had been in touch with the Russians Now today can you still say definitively that nobody on the Trump campaign  not even General Flynn  had any contact with the Russians before the electionSPICER My understanding is that what General Flynn has now expressed is that during the transition period  well we were very clear that during the transition period he did  he did speak with the ambassadorQUESTION Im talking about during the campaignSPICER I dont have any  I  theres nothing that would conclude me that anything different has changed with respect to that time periodWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway said this back in aDecember appearance on Face the Nationwith John DickersonDICKERSON Did anyone involved in the Trump campaign have any contact with Russians trying to meddle with the election Absolutely not And I discussed that with the president-elect just last night Those conversations never happenedI hear people saying it like its a fact on television That is just not only inaccurate and false but its dangerous and it does undermine our democracyThere was also then-Vice President-elect Pence during Jan 15 interviews in which he  to the United States Speaking to Fox News Sundays Chris Wallace Pence also denied any contact between the campaign and the KremlinWALLACE Im asking a direct question Was there any contact in any way between Trump or his associates and the Kremlin or cutouts they had I joined this campaign in the summer and I can tell you that all the contact by the Trump campaign and associates was with the American people We were fully engaged with taking his message to make America great again all across this country Thats why he won in a landslide election(CROSSTALK) -- if there were any contacts sir Im just trying to get an answer Yes I  of course not  be any contacts between the campaign Chris the  this is all a distraction and its all part of a narrative to delegitimize the election and to question the legitimacy of this presidency The American people see right through itAnd here he was the same day on Face the NationDICKERSON Just to button up one question did any adviser or anybody in the Trump campaign have any contact with the Russians who were trying to meddle in the electionMIKE PENCE Of course not And I think to suggest that is to give credence to some of these bizarre rumors that have swirled around the candidacyAll of these statements could be parsed endlesslySpicers comments Tuesday dont seem to double down on Trumps words so much as not want to say anything new So he let Trumps comments standConway was responding directly to a question about contacting Russians trying to meddle with the election The new reports dont indicate that the contacts were specifically with such people so much as Russians tied to intelligence more generallyAnd Pence was asked specifically about contact with the Kremlin or cutouts they had Again the reports dont indicate direct contact with the Kremlin  only Russian intelligence officials or Russians known to US intelligence (whose status might not have been known to the Trump campaign team per the Times)But these denials take a pretty hard line against the idea of any contact between the Trump campaign and Russia involving a whole lot of peopleAnd as we get more specific details well see how well they hold upAs White House press secretary Sean Spicer tried to clarify his statement during a news briefing on Tuesdayit was clear that he was only adding to the heap of criticism he was about to get Washington Post reporter Ashley Parker was listeningto him speak in the briefing room Little did she know that she was about to go viral too  Parkers facial expressions as Spicer spoke were captured on video and broadcast along with his remarksPress Sec on Hitler/Assad comments He was not using the gas on his own people the same wayhe brought them into the Holocaust centers  ABC News (@ABC) Soon Twitter had isolated a GIF of the whole thingthe journey in this gif is unbelievable  Seb FoxAllen (@purpledocket) The GIF became a collective reaction meme for those who were stunned by what Spicer said a subtle real-time expression of how Twitter felt watching him speakParker a wise Twitter skeptic was nice enough to answer a few questions about the whole thing Our questions are in bold with her answers below them We condensed and edited for clarityIm going to betray my rather tenuous Millennial designation by revealing that I still dont really fully understand the difference between a GIF and a meme But suffice it to say that shortly after the briefing ended I realized that my eyebrows were all over the InternetI think I was vacillating between confusion and disbelief as Spicer unfurled his answer Because he had basically been given a pretty fair easy opportunity to clean up his earlier misstatement and instead we were all watching in real time as he made it infinitely worseI maintain my healthy skepticismI hope not While my interior monologue may have inadvertently played out on my face  Im a pretty horrible liar generally  I always try to be fair in my coverage and respectful in my relationships with the White House (and anyone I cover for that matter) and I think (I hope) that matters more than a random raised eyebrow that happened to go viralMy favorite response was probably from friends family editors and even sources who all texted me to say We know that face Apparently Im both perpetually expressive and skeptical And

only hospital serving the poorest neighborhoods in the nations capital  Ive been trying to get information and its just a merry-go-round I never get a straight answer said Meiko Brown the dead mans 43-year-old daughter Its absolutely crazy Ive never heard of anything like thisBradford Brown had lived in UMCs nursing home since 2015 when he suffered a debilitating stroke On Aug2 his sister Barbara Hunter and Meiko Brown walked into UMCs lobby bearing a gift of ginger snaps and Lays potato chips for their relativeBefore a wall covered with portraits of the hospitals board members a receptionist told them there was no patient at the hospital named Bradford BrownPerplexed but not yet alarmed the family rode the elevator to Browns ward on the sixth floor where a nurse spotted them and asked a colleague Do they not know he expiredHunter an occupational therapist with long experience in health care interjected Expired as in deadAs her 10-year-old began crying Meiko Brown said she gasped and started to scream I completely lost it she said I couldnt breathe It was like something else took over my bodyBrowns records indicated he died after he was transferred to the emergency room with breathing problems on July26 and that his family was notified the same daySeeking an explanation Meiko Brown and Hunter met two days later with hospital officials UMC administrator Ola Fadairo could offer no insight into the mix-up but said officials were conducting an investigation of the incident and that it had been an eye-opener for the hospitalThere are errors in this Fadairo said according to Browns audio recording of the meeting Whoever is at fault we need to do some remodeling and fix the problemHe continued One thing I want to assure you is that we have taken steps to block this type of thing happening again Youve been a help to us and we continually need your support and help because we need to portray the image of this establishment This is the only black hospital so far around here and we must do something to maintain it  My sister youve been loved He has left a legacy for you Hold on to that legacy It is well Maam I feel you It is well Amen  Fadairo promised the family a written report on the hospitals handling of the notification process in Browns death saying Were going to get to the bottom of this This is not endingReached by telephone Friday morning Fadairo said the meeting had been the end of his involvement in Browns caseI was just there as a supervisor who is trying to appease them he said Fadairo who said he acts as a minister outside his hospital job said he had done his best to console Meiko Brown and Hunter but had no idea what had become of the inquiry into whether Browns next of kin were properly notified of his death That was the duty of his colleagues in the nursing home he saidI have no clue he said I did not pursue the investigationThe only person in Browns circle who recalls speaking to hospital staff on July26 is An-Nas Osiris Bey who said a nurse called to tell him Brown had been transferred to the intensive care unit as he had in the past because of breathing problems Bey said he later received a second call from the hospital nurses station but that it was cut off after he answered and nobody picked up when he called backBey is a close family friend who visited Brown frequently at the hospital and had given hospital officials his phone numberIn the recording of the Aug4 meeting a nurse said she called Bey after Brown was dead and said during their brief conversation that she was sorry for the loss When Bey did not react to her comment she said she suspected he had not been notified and rather than telling him suggested he check on Brown at the emergency roomI said So are you on your way to the ER In my head I was like Maybe they havent informed him about it Let me not push the nurse said I told my director of nursing Hmm its like they havent informed him yetBey said he did not remember the nurse ever saying sorry for the lossIn response to questions from The Post a UMC spokeswoman issued a brief written statement We have reviewed the circumstances of this case and confirm that the hospital followed all proper protocols including notification to the next of kin in a timely mannerThe Post spoke to each of Browns four children who live in the Washington region All said they had been informed of their fathers death by Meiko Brown when she learned upon her visit to the hospitalHis surviving relatives said their back-and-forth with UMC has aggravated their grief for Brown a retired tailor known among friends and relatives for his sometimes baroque sweet tooth  peanut butter and jelly on pound cake was among his preferred dishes  and sense of humor On his daughters 25th birthday he gave her an elaborately gift-wrapped rock with the words Hard head soft a-- written on it in indelible markerAnd this week family members said the saga took another exasperating turnHunter Bey and Meiko Brown said they were unable to view Bradford Browns body in the weeks after he died told by hospital officials that there was no convenient place to do so They said they became suspicious about the circumstances of his death and hoped that if his body reached a city coroner  after 30days according to city law hospitals must transfer unclaimed bodies to the medical examiners office  an autopsy might be performedBey said a hospital official told him the corpse would be sent to the medical examiners office when the 30-day period ended last Saturday On Monday Meiko Brown called the medical examiner and was told the body was still at UMCFor the next several days she said she continued to call the hospital trying to ascertain the whereabouts of her fathers corpse but each time hospital staff told her they were unsure and would have to call her backOn Thursday  the same day The Post called hospital officials with questions about the case  Bey said he finally received a call from the medical examiners office telling him the body had arrived that afternoonIts far from clear that the medical examiners office will probe more deeply into Browns cause of death because such scrutiny is typically reserved only for suspicious casesBut Browns relatives said that regardless of what happens they hope for some understanding and closure now that Brown is no longer in the custody of UMCWe havent even seen his body yet Bey said We dont even know if hes really deadThe user whose screen name is a vulgar corruptionof Han Solospent about a year on Redditbefore attaining

surgeries and possibly continuing to serveThe suit filed in federal court in Maryland on behalf of six active-duty military members argues that the ban is unconstitutional because it discriminates against transgender peopleIts such an egregious attempt to target transgender individuals who have devoted their careers and lives to the United States said Chase Strangio a staff attorney for the ACLU The president claims in tweets transgender service costs money and military readiness The reality is the Department of Defense concluded after years of study that is baselessA Defense Department spokesman referred questions to the Justice DepartmentWe are examining the claims in this lawsuit and conferring within the Government the Justice Department wrote in a statementThe lawsuit was filed days after Trump formally ordered the Pentagon to ban the recruitment of openly transgender people and to determine whether those already serving should be allowed to remain It is at least the third civil suit challenging Trumps transgender military ban  In late July Trump first floated his plan for a transgender military ban in a  After consultation with my Generals and military experts please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the US Military Trump wrote Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entailThe decision was cheered by many religious conservatives but angered LGBT activists liberals and some in Trumps own party such as Sen John McCain (R-Ariz) who complained about the president rolling out a major policy on Twitter and possibly forcing people out of the military who were otherwise qualifiedThe ban reversed an Obama administration decision to allow transgender people to serve openly The armed forces were set to begin enlisting transgender people July1 but Defense Secretary Jim Mattis delayed that move citing a need for more studyBefore the policy change by the Obama administration the Pentagon had concluded that there was no basis for the military to exclude transgender people There is no official tally of transgender military members and estimates vary widely One  by the Rand Corp put the number on active duty at about 2500 while  from the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School estimated that there were 15500 on active duty in the National Guard and in the reservesThe plaintiffs in the lawsuit are Navy Petty Officer 1st Class

available for commentOn May 9 Donald Trump became the second United States president to fire the director of the FBI Naturally Americans wanted to know WhyThe exact answer remained elusive over the course of three days following the announcementTrump and his White Housegave numerous contradictory explanations for James B Comeys firingAs a public service we compiled a timeline of the shifting rhetoric by Trump and his staff We will update this list as necessaryThe original explanation from Trump and his White House was that Deputy Attorney General Rod J Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions  In a Rosenstein criticized Comeys handling of the FBIs investigation into Hillary Clintons private email server use as secretary of state He did not explicitly call for his dismissalSessions forwarded the letter to Trump recommending he remove ComeyTrump then wrote a letter to Comey saying he was acting on their recommendationWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer issued a statement with the White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway echoed it on CNN I would point them to the three letters that were received today Anderson [Cooper] Ata news briefing later that night Spicer made it clear that the decision was made by DOJ and Rosenstein From our colleague Jenna Johnsons The next day White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders revealed Trump actually asked for the recommendation of Rosenstein and Sessions Trump had been losing confidence in Comey for months and had been considering firing him since Election Day she said CNNs Jonathan Karl asked Sanders Sanders answered Vice President Pence  that Trump decided to act on the recommendations by Rosenstein and Sessions and that Rosenstein independently had decided to conduct an investigation of Comeys handling of the Clinton probePENCE the AGs office acted independently in reviewing and recommending that FBI Director Comey be fired Via    Jennifer Grygiel (@jmgrygiel) Separately Trump told reporters that he fired Comey because he wasnt doing a good job Very simple He wasnt doing a good jobLater that day the White House released an official timeline of Trumps decision-making processThen that evening The Washington Posts  that Rosenstein threatened to resign after the narrative emerging from the White House on Tuesday evening cast him as a prime mover of the decision to fire Comey and that the president acted only on his recommendationThe president then contradicted his staffs earlier comments In a preview video clip of his Trump said he planned to fire Comey all along regardless of Department of Justice recommendations     The  that RosensteinIn a subsequent news briefing Sanders clarified her comments from the previous day Trumps Monday meeting with Rosenstein and Sessions reaffirmed what Trump already was planning to do she saidWH spox Sarah Huckabee Sanders Ive had that conversation w/president now and he said hed been thinking about firing Comey for months Michelle Ye Hee Lee (@myhlee) Later on Thursday NBC aired itsfull interview with Trump In it Trump offered yet another reason for firing Comey The FBIsinvestigation into Russias interference in the 2016 presidential election (Sanders had hinted at this earlier in the day saying the White House believed that by removing Comey it took steps to make sure the FBIs Russia investigation would come to its conclusion with integrity)In a closed-door briefing to the full Senate on May 18  Comey would be fired before he wrote his May 9 memo that the White House used as justification to fire Comey Rosenstein told senators he was not pressured into writing the memoHe learned the presidents decision to fire him and then he wrote his memo with his rationale said Sen Richard Durbin (D-Ill)Meanwhile Trump said in a May 18 news conference that firing Comey was something even Democrats wanted And he once again cited Rosensteins memo()FORT BRAGG NC  James Hatch a broad-shouldered former Navy SEAL

Veritas of Washington had been in business just over a year when it won a lucrative contract to salvage DCs only public hospital Key members of its management team had led a New York hospital that filed for bankruptcy The District would become its sole clientAfter the administration of Mayor Muriel E Bowser (D)  who received more than $35000 in political donations from the firms founders family and affiliated companies campaign-finance records show  authorized a no-bid contract for consultants to stanch financial losses at United Medical Center Veritas began work for a fee of $300000 permonthA year and a half later the hospital continues to face financial uncertainty and is coping with new medical crises  including regulators closure of the obstetrics ward last month because of unsafe conditions And public records reviewed by The Washington Post show Veritas has failed to meet a number of the citys standards for managing the hospital  A recent report on the Veritas contract by city officials states the firm which has collected about $5million in taxpayer dollars has delivered about a tenth of the $9million in extra revenue it projected it would generate for the hospital this fiscal year Veritas is on track to meet its overarching mandate District officials predict the hospital will end the year with a razor-thin profit margin after years of red ink and taxpayer subsidies But records show that is largely because of billing improvements overseen by DC Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey S DeWittMeanwhile the companys employees have billed tens of thousands of dollars in work-related expenses to the cityThe District is reimbursing two Veritas managers  hospital chief executive Luis Hernandez and quality manager Diane Kelly  an average of more than $7400 a month to fly back and forth to DC from their homes in Florida and North Carolina During the week the District pays for them to rent apartments at National Harbor in Maryland according to expense reports reviewed by The Post Even their gas and electricity bills are reimbursed by taxpayersSuch spending has continued as UMC remains in precarious financial shape and continues to generate complaints from its patients many of whom come from the poorest and most violent neighborhoods in the nations capitalFiniya Johnson 20 gave birth at UMC in January before health regulators halted deliveries She said only one doctor was attending to multiple women on the obstetrics ward and as a result nurses tried to delay her delivery When her son was born he was not breathing and needed to be resuscitated she saidIts just horrible Johnson said standing outside the hospital on a recent morning after a pediatric appointment for her son I dont know where their money going  Veritas officials declined to provide details about their $36 million annual fee and refused to disclose the salaries of the three executives who work full-time at UMC saying they are not subject to the Districts public-information laws because they are paid by Veritas rather than the hospital Hernandez and Kelly declined to comment through a hospital spokeswomanCorbett Price the companys executive chairman said Veritas was doing its job Steadying the hospitals financial situation so the District could find a private company to build a new hospital on the east side of the cityBut Price who is married to Veritas owner Chrystie Boucre cautioned against setting expectations too high for an institution that has struggled as long as UMCIt has a historical pattern No company can instantaneously come in to correct that Price said There will be no miracle turnaround so to speakDC Health Care Finance Director Wayne Turnage who recommended Veritas to the hospital board last year said despite its shortcomings the company was meeting its broad goal of stabilizing a beleaguered medical facilityCan they do better Absolutely Turnage said But you also have to think about the hospital theyre working in Were not talking about a well-funded state-of-the-art hospitalSince it opened 50 years ago Southeast Washingtons only fullservice hospital has struggled to find an economically viable formula for providing care to the poor and mostly African American neighborhoods east of the Anacostia RiverThe hospital which sits at the Districts border with Maryland went through bankruptcy about 20 years ago and after a turbulent period of corporate management that included the loss of its accreditation was taken over by the city in 2010The move came as many municipalities were abandoning public hospitals because of their financial challenges  including the District which closed DC General Hospital in 2001 The city agreed in 2013 to a two-year $128 million contract with Huron Consulting a national firm specializing in hospital turnarounds The company deployed dozens of its employees to the hospital and improved UMCs operating margins but was unable to find a long-term operator to take over the hospital when its contract expired  In 2015 the hospital required a $7 million subsidy from the District to meet its payroll the next year that rose to $10 million In early 2016 the mayor decided the hospital board should invoke its emergency authority to select a new consultant Turnage recommended VeritasAt the center of the company is Price who has built a lucrative career in the halls of struggling hospitals throughout the I-95 corridor His constellation of consulting firms has thrived along the border between public and private health care a field where business models collide with the reality of caring for societys sickest and poorest and success often means postponing failureHe began his career at the for-profit Hospital Corporation of America in the 1980s After that companys contract to run Prince Georges Hospital Center ended he stayed on as hospital chief executive But the hospitals board soon replaced him as it sought a speedier turnaround said former Prince Georges County executive and longtime board member Winfield M Kelly JrIt didnt work real well for us Kelly recalled He tried real hard he tried to get it done he didnt get it done Competent guy it just didnt work outIn 1990 Price founded Kurron Shares of America a consulting firm that soon took over the management of Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn Two decades later the companys stewardship ended after the hospital filed for bankruptcyAn ombudsman appointed by the bankruptcy court found lapses in care at the facility  particularly the emergency room which he described in a report as more chaotic and disorganized than others he had seen The ombudsman asserted Price the chief restructuring officer visited the hospital infrequently and should be more actively engaged in the day-to-day on-site responsibilities of the hospitalIn a response to the report lawyers for the hospital said the criticism stemmed from a misunderstanding of Prices role which was not running the hospital on a day-to-day basisIn the spring of 2013 the New York State Department of Health barred Kurron from continuing to manage the hospital Spokeswoman Jill Montag said in a statement to The Post that regulators had concerns about the pay provisions in Kurrons contract including those for open-ended reimbursement of expenses and bonuses to the companys executivesPrice blamed the hospitals financial failure on New York state cuts to Medicaid rates in 2011 He said Interfaith would have run aground much sooner without his firm Kurron did an outstanding job if I may say so myself based on our longevity there People forget that he saidFor two decades Prices family and companies had contributed to New York politicians but written only a handful of checks to campaigns in the District none of them to Bowser That changed a little over a year after Kurron had been forced out of Interfaith Medical CenterIn 2014 Price his relatives and his companies made $35191 in political contributions to Bowser records show including $20000 in contributions to Bowsers inaugural committee from Price and Mantium a Bethesda-based corporation registered in his namePrice said he met Bowser while she was campaigning and had no anticipation of future business dealings with the cityI live in Washington I believe in your responsibility as a citizen there he said Just because I give to someones campaign I dont expect anything in returnIn 2015 Bowser appointed Price to the board of the regions public-transit system She said in a recent interview she met Price through his in-laws whom she had represented as a Ward 4 council memberPrices financial support for her political career had nothing to do with his Metro board appointment or with the selection of Veritas to run UMC the mayor saidEverybody involved in our administration made decisions based on the best interests of the District of Columbia and UMC she said We had a situation where we could not make payroll at a hospital that serves a key part of the city and we had no confidence that the people in place would be able to turn that aroundTurnage said it had been his idea to bring Veritas on at the hospital He said he and Price met in 2015 and bonded over their shared alma mater Ohio State University Informal discussions about how to shore up UMC followed Turnage said and he ultimately recommended Prices company to the UMC board because he believed their fees were lower than better-known competitorsHe said an emergency contract was necessary because the normal competitive bidding process would have taken too longI can assure you that I had no discussions with anybody in the mayors office about these contracts Turnage saidCraig Holman of the nonprofit Public Citizen said the placement of campaign donors at the helm of a struggling public hospital could nevertheless raise questions about the Bowser administrations oversight of the facility Whether or not her actions were appropriate its going to raise questions and red flags anytime someone who is a government contractor gets involved in making campaign contributions Holman saidSince 2014 Prices family and related companies have also given $6000 to the campaign of council member Brandon T Todd Bowsers hand-picked successor for her Ward 4 DC Council seat and $3000 to former council member LaRuby May a Bowser ally whom the mayor appointed chairwoman of the UMC board this year according to campaign-finance recordsMay declined to comment on her ability to oversee the Veritas contract in light of those donations She said in a brief interview that the hospital has not provided the highest level of patient quality services but is headed in the right directionEven by the standards of struggling public hospitals UMC has been buffeted this year by an extraordinary succession of bad newsMedicare billing errors led to a 45 percent operating deficit in February that had city officials briefly worried about another taxpayer subsidy That was followed by a $122000 fine by the DC Department of Health in April for poor patient care at the hospitals nursing homeCity officials say they are now girding for legal claims over the problems that led regulators to shutter the nursery and delivery rooms including what District health regulators said was a failure to take routine steps to prevent a newborn from contracting HIV Just last week a family came forward to complain they had not been notified of a loved ones death at the hospital until a week had passed UMC executive David Boucre the third Veritas employee who works full-time at the hospital said it would take time to reverse the hospitals history of dysfunctionBoucre who is the cousin of Prices wife said his professional background was in information technology  including work with health insurance companies  and outsourcing He said Veritas had made improvements to the hospital that included hiring additional urology and gastroenterology doctors and refurbishing the behavioral-health unit and surgical suiteWere advancing the ball Boucre said Theres still a lot of work thats left to be done I dont think anyone expected it all to be done in six months nine months a year or two yearsSince December Turnage and DeWitt have conducted monthly assessments of Veritas performance in categories such as patient admissions baby deliveries and lab visitsAt the time of the most recent review in July the firms year-to-date record showed it falling short in 41 percent of its metrics according to a report reviewed by The Post DeWitt and Turnage noted Veritas had realized $107million of the $9 million in revenue its executives had said they could generate by reforming hospital operationsAll agree that the performance  for a myriad of reasons  has lagged Turnage wrote in August to city officials (In an interview Turnage said he was referring specifically to the consultants failure to generate new revenue rather than their overall performance) Still the hospital is on course to end the year in the black thanks to several million dollars generated by improvements to the billing process made by the citys chief financial officer he saidWithout this surprise Turnage

chairman Vincent Gray (D-Ward 7) who is widely believed to be considering a challenge to Bowser next year said such spending is unacceptableFor a hospital that is financially strapped that is being supported by the District of Columbia taxpayers this seems like an incredible waste of money said Gray who was mayor until 2015 and oversaw the citys previous hospital-management contract with the national firm Huron Consulting Its shocking that money would be spent in these waysTurnage said the expenses are reasonable because qualified hospital-turnaround experts are rare and cant be expected to move to a new part of the country for a short-term contract He said Hurons incidental expenses were included in their base fee and so could not be directly compared to those of VeritasIt is common

thing Consulting is often in the eye of the beholder Julie Tate contributed to this reportThe United Arab Emirates arranged a secret meeting in January between Blackwater founder Erik Prince and a Russian close to President Vladimir Putin as part of an apparent effort to establish a back-channel line of communication between Moscow and President-elect Donald Trump according to US European and Arab officialsThe meeting took place around Jan 11  nine days before Trumps inauguration  in the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean officials said Though the full agenda remains unclear the UAE agreed to broker the meeting in part to explore whether Russia could be persuaded to curtail its relationship with Iran including in Syria a Trump administration objective that would be likely to require major concessions to Moscow on US sanctionsThough Prince had no formal role with the Trump campaign or transition team he presented himself as an unofficial envoy for Trump to high-ranking Emiratis involved in setting up his meeting with the Putin confidant according to the officials who did not identify the RussianPrince was an avid supporter of Trump After the Republican convention he contributed $250000 to Trumps campaign the national party and a pro-Trump super PAC led by GOP mega-donor Rebekah Mercer records show He has ties to people in Trumps circle including Stephen K Bannon now serving as the presidents chief strategist and senior counselor Princes sister Betsy DeVos serves as education secretary in the Trump administration And Prince was seen in the Trump transition offices in New York in DecemberUS officials said the FBI has been scrutinizing the Seychelles meeting as part of a broader probe of Russian interference in the 2016 US election and alleged contacts between associates of Putin and Trump The FBI declined to commentThe Seychelles encounter which one official said spanned two days adds to an expanding web of connections between Russia and Americans with ties to Trump  contacts that the White House has been reluctant to acknowledge or explain until they have been exposed by news organizationsWe are not aware of any meetings and Erik Prince had no role in the transition said Sean Spicer the White House press secretaryA Prince spokesman said in a statement Erik had no role on the transition team This is a complete fabrication The meeting had nothing to do with President Trump Why is the so-called under-resourced intelligence community messing around with surveillance of American citizens when they should be hunting terroristsPrince is best known as the founder of Blackwater a security firm that became a symbol of US abuses in Iraq after a series of incidents including one in 2007 in which the companys guards were accused  and later criminally convicted  of killing civilians in a crowded Iraqi square Prince sold the firm which was subsequently re-branded but has continued building a private paramilitary empire with contracts across the Middle East and Asia He now heads a Hong Kong-based company known as the Frontier Services GroupPrince would probably have been seen as too controversial to serve in any official capacity in the Trump transition or administration But his ties to Trump advisers experience with clandestine work and relationship with the royal leaders of the Emirates  where he moved in 2010 amid mounting legal problems for his American business  would have positioned him as an ideal go-betweenThe Seychelles meeting came after separate private discussions in New York involving high-ranking representatives of Trump with both Moscow and the EmiratesThe White House has acknowledged that Michael T Flynn Trumps original national security adviser and Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner met with the Russian ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak in late November or early December in New YorkFlynn and Kushner were joined by Bannon for a separate meeting with the crown prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan who made an undisclosed visit to New York later in December according to the US European and Arab officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive mattersIn an unusual breach of protocol the UAE did not notify the Obama administration in advance of the visit though officials found out because Zayeds name appeared on a flight manifestOfficials said Zayed and his brother the UAEs national security adviser coordinated the Seychelles meeting with Russian government officials with the goal of establishing an unofficial back channel between Trump and PutinOfficials said Zayed wanted to be helpful to both leaders who had talked about working more closely together a policy objective long advocated by the crown prince The UAE which sees Iran as one of its main enemies also shared the Trump teams interest in finding ways to drive a wedge between Moscow and TehranZayed met twice with Putin in 2016 according to Western officials and urged the Russian leader to work more closely with the Emirates and Saudi Arabia  an effort to isolate IranAt the time of the Seychelles meeting and for weeks afterward the UAE believed that Prince had the blessing of the new administration to act as its unofficial representative The Russian participant was a person whom Zayed knew was close to Putin from his interactions with both men the officials saidWhen the Seychelles meeting took place official contacts between members of the incoming Trump administration and the Russian government were under intense scrutiny both from federal investigators and the pressLess than a week before the Seychelles meeting US intelligence agencies released a report accusing Russia of intervening clandestinely during the 2016 election to help Trump win the White HouseThe FBI was already investigating communications between Flynn and Kislyak  first disclosed those communications on Jan12 around the time of the Seychelles meeting Flynn was subsequently fired by Trump for misleading Vice President Pence and others about his discussions with KislyakYousef Al Otaiba the UAEs ambassador in Washington declined to commentGovernment officials in the Seychelles said they were not aware of any meetings between Trump and Putin associates in the country around Jan11 But they said luxury resorts on the island are ideal for clandestine gatherings like the one described by the US European and Arab officialsI wouldnt be surprised at all said Barry Faure the Seychelles secretary of state for foreign affairs The Seychelles is the kind of place where you can have a good time away from the eyes of the media Thats even printed in our tourism marketing But I guess this time you smelled somethingTrump has dismissed the investigations of Russias role in the election as fake news and a witch huntThe level of discretion surrounding the Seychelles meeting seems extraordinary given the frequency with which senior Trump advisers including Flynn and Kushner had interacted with Russian officials in the United States including at the high-profile Trump Tower in New YorkSteven Simon a National Security Council senior director for the Middle East and North Africa in the Obama White House said The idea of using business cutouts or individuals perceived to be close to political leaders as a tool of diplomacy is as old as the hills These unofficial channels are desirable precisely because they are deniable ideas can be tested without the risk of failureCurrent and former US officials said that while Prince refrained from playing a direct role in the Trump transition his name surfaced so frequently in internal discussions that he seemed to function as an outside adviser whose opinions were valued on a range of issues including plans for overhauling the US intelligence communityHe appears to have particularly close ties to Bannon appearing multiple times on the Breitbart satellite radio program and website that Bannon ran before joining the Trump campaign In a July interview with Bannon Prince said those seeking forceful US leadership should wait till January and hope Mr Trump is elected And he lashed out at President Barack Obama saying that because of his policies the terrorists the fascists are winningDays before the November election Prince appeared on the Breitbart radio program saying that he had well-placed sources in the New York City Police Department telling him they were preparing to make arrests in the investigation of former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-NY) over allegations he exchanged sexually explicit texts with a minor Flynn tweeted a link to the Breitbart report on the claim No arrests occurredPrince went on to make unfounded assertions that damaging material recovered from Weiners computers would implicate Hillary Clinton and her close adviser Huma Abedin who was married to Weiner He also called Abedin an agent of influence very sympathetic to the Muslim BrotherhoodPrince and his family were major GOP donors in 2016 The Center for Responsive Politics reported that the family gave more than $10 million to GOP candidates and super PACs including about $27 million from his sister DeVos and her husbandPrinces father Edgar Prince built his fortune through an auto-parts company Betsy married Richard DeVos Jr heir to the Amway fortuneErik Prince has had lucrative contracts with the UAE government which at one point paid his firm a reported $529million to help bring in foreign fighters to help assemble an internal paramilitary force capable of carrying out secret operations and protecting Emirati installations from terrorist attacksThe Trump administration and the UAE appear to share a similar preoccupation with Iran Current and former officials said that Trump advisers were focused throughout the transition period on exploring ways to get Moscow to break ranks with TehranSeparating Russia from Iran was a common theme said a former intelligence official in the Obama administration who met with Trump transition officials It didnt seem very well thought out It seemed a little premature They clearly had a very specific policy position which I found odd given that they hadnt even taken the reins and explored with experts in the US government the pros and cons of that approachMichael McFaul former US ambassador to Russia said he also had discussions with people close to the Trump administration about the prospects of drawing Russia away from Iran When I would hear this I would think Yeah thats great for you guys but why would Putin ever do that McFaul said There is no interest in Russia ever doing that They have a long relationship with Iran Theyre allied with Iran in fighting in Syria They sell weapons to Iran Iran is an important strategic partner for Russia in the Middle EastFollowing the New York meeting between the Emiratis and Trump aides Zayed was approached by Prince who said he was authorized to act as an unofficial surrogate for the president-elect according to the officials He wanted Zayed to set up a meeting with a Putin associate Zayed agreed and proposed the Seychelles as the meeting place because of the privacy it would afford both sides He wanted to be helpful one official said of ZayedWealthy Russians and Emirati royalty have a particularly large footprint on the islands Signs advertising

meeting without getting a green light in advance from top aides to Trump and Putin if not the leaders themselves MBZ is very cautious said an American businessman who knows Zayed and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject There had to be a nodThe Seychelles meeting was deemed productive by the UAE and Russia but the idea of arranging additional meetings between Prince and Putins associates was dropped officials said Even unofficial contacts between Trump and Putin associates had become too politically risky officials said Sieff reported from the Seychelles Julie Tate Devlin Barrett Matea Gold Tom Hamburger and Rosalind S Helderman contributed to this reportThe acting chief of the Bill Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation acknowledged in a new statement that the global philanthropy launched 15 years ago by the former president has made missteps  but defended the organizations charitable work and its commitment to transparencyThe new  posted Sunday to the organizations blog comes in a response to a flood of scrutiny of the charity and its donors that has coincided with Hillary Rodham Clintons entry into the presidential campaign The attention has led Republicans to charge thatClinton istoo cozy with donors who have given millions to her familys foundation helping to burnish her reputation in the processIt has also threatened the reputation of the charity which runs health and poverty reduction programs around the worldThe foundations acting chief executive officer Maura Pally said in the statement that the organizationhas instituted new commitments to openness as its impact has grown When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009 the foundation began annually disclosing its donors which is not required by law and instituted new procedures for accepting contributions from foreign governments (The agreement with the Obama administration was not a ban the foundation has acknowledged accepting millions from foreign governments in these years)[]After Clinton entered the race the foundation announced that it would accept donations only from a handful of countries that have funded continuing programs The foundationalso said it would begin disclosing its donors four times a yearAt the same time the foundation confirmed last week that it is likely to resubmit several years of tax filings to the Internal Revenue Service after discovering that theyincorrectly reported that the organization received no support from foreign governments in those years Pally stressed that the forms had accurately reflected the foundations overall revenue but said the filings would be correctedSo yes we made mistakes as many organizations of our size do but we are acting quickly to remedy them and have taken steps to ensure they dont happen in the future Pally said in the statement We are committed to operating the Foundation responsibly and effectively to continue the life-changing work that this philanthropy is doing every dayBill Clinton founded the organization in 2001 after leaving the White House In the years since it has grown into a worldwide $2 billion enterprise In 2013 after Hillary Clinton stepped down as secretary of state she joined the foundations board and the organization added her name as well as that of daughter Chelsea to its title On announcing her presidential candidacy Hillary Clinton stepped down from the boardThe foundation announced last month that former secretary of health and human services Donna Shalala a longtime Clinton ally would succeed Pally as the operational head of the charity Bill Clinton remains on the foundations board as does daughter Chelsea who serves as the organizations vice chairThe organization has a complicated structure including 11 charitable initiatives some of which have at timesincorporated separately and filed their own tax returns to the IRSIn her statement Pally highlighted the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership which works to alleviate poverty and is named for Frank Giustra a Canadian mining magnate who sits on the foundations board and is one of its largest donorsShe explained that the partnership receives direct funding from a separate organization by the same name that is based in Canada Unlike the Clinton Foundation the Canadian Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership does not disclose its donors she said in keeping with Canadian lawThe partnership has received increased scrutiny in recent days because of Giustras role in a  last week that looked at the role of foundation donors in a deal that resulted in a Russian state-owned company owning large deposits of uranium around the world including in the United StatesPallys explanation is intended to shed light on why certaindonors who have been publicly identified as contributors to the Clinton Giustra charitable effort do not appearamong donors listed on the Clinton Foundations Web siteThis is hardly an effort on our part to avoid transparency unlike in the US under Canadian law all charities are prohibited from disclosing individual donors without prior permission from each donor she said in the statementShe said the foundations rules were intended to assist it in its mission of addressing climate change and childhood obesity and bringing low-cost drugs to people around the world Without question the Foundations accomplishments stand on their own she said One thing is clear The Clinton Foundation has not been afraid to take on big challenges and see resultsRead moreAmid heightened scrutiny over the Clinton Foundations finances the organizations acting chief executive recently released a statement in a blog post acknowledging mistakes in filing tax forms Pally defended a Canadian charity affiliated with the foundation which had come under fire for not disclosing its individual donorsCritics say that the Clinton Foundation should voluntarily disclose information about donors to the Canadian charity  the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada)  as a part of a 2008 agreement between the Obama administration and Hillary Rodham Clinton to publicly disclose donors Learning about donors to the Canadian charity would reveal whether any may have had business before the State Department when Clinton was secretary of State in President Obamas first termPally noted in her blog post that the charity under Canadian law is prohibited from disclosing individual donors without prior permission from each donor The charityhas begun reaching out to its 28 largest donors  out of 1100 totaldonors  to seek permission to release their names (For more read Rosalind S Heldermans earlier)The Fact Checker does not take a position on whether the donations should be made public Instead we examined the layers of Canadian legal requirements for charities to see which laws would apply to the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada) aka CGEPartnership Is Pallys statement accurateCGEPartnership raises money for the similarly-named Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership one of the Clinton Foundations initiatives There is no blanket prohibition on charities to ever release donor names (Hat tip to Mollie Hemingway at   of whether a blanket federal ban exists)Canadian privacy law is quite complex so we will spare our readers the minutiaeIn general charities registered with the Canadian federal government in the Income Tax Act the federal privacy law and any provincial laws that may applyThe Income Tax Act regulates whether the Canada Revenue Agency (equivalent of the Internal Revenue Service) can disclose taxpayer information including donor information It does not regulate whether a registered charity can disclose donor informationThe federal privacy law is called the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act or PIPEDA This law requires organizations to get permission from donors if they are releasing their information for a commercial purpose  selling bartering or leasing of donor membership or other fundraising lists (This is a key point that we will return to momentarily)Most non-profits are not subject to the PIPEDA because fundraising is not a commercial activity But charities are not automatically exempt The law does not prohibit charities from releasing information for non-commercial purposesAccording to Valerie Lawton spokeswoman for the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (the agency that oversees compliance with this law) If a charity is not engaged in a commercial activity such as selling bartering or leasing a donor list then PIPEDA would not apply to the charitys activities  including whether it makes public a donor list That being said there may be other Canadian laws which dont fall under our jurisdiction that could apply to the publishing of donor listsThose other laws may be on the provincial level Not all provinces have their own privacy laws but British Columbia does And guess where CGEPartnership is domiciled Vancouver British ColumbiaBritish Columbias privacy law is stricter than the federal law though substantially similar  to get donor permission when they collect use or disclose their personal information The province does not have a public database that shows which charities are subject to this law and aspokeswoman for the Office of theInformation and Privacy Commissioner for British Columbia could not immediately confirm whether CGEPartnership was subject to provincial lawThis law does not apply to federally-regulated organizations already governed by PEPIDAIt is not entirely clear which law applies to CGEPartnership The organization did not clarify when we asked Some experts said it would operate under provincial law because the federal one generally applies to corporations like airports and banks Others also said it would make sense for CGEPartnership to be regulated by federal law as it applies to data that cross provincial or national borders and the charity is federally registeredCGEPartnerships memo about donor lists says the charity and its directors are mindful of their obligations under the federal law The charity has interpreted the release of donor names as bartering and considers it a matter of caution and good governance to take a wide view of the definition [of bartering] in terms of CGEPartnerships duty to keep donor information completely private without the consent of the donor or unless compelled by lawAdam Aptowitzer Ottawa-based charity lawyer said CGEPartnership is taking a rather shaky and an extremely conservative view of the law It is difficult to see how releasing the list would be bartering given that there seems to be no payment or consideration for the release of the listThe memo also says the Board of Directors has a fiduciary responsibility when maintaining its donor list especially for donors who gave money in confidence Using donor lists for any reason other than furtherance of its own current charitable purposes will constitute a breach of fiduciary duty it saysMany charities already get consent from donors to give recognition and have boilerplate language when asking for donations said Mark Blumberg Toronto-based charity lawyer CGEPartnership did not answer The Fact Checkers request for any consent agreements or policies for donorsMany organizations ask Do you wish to remain anonymous This is pretty common stuff Blumberg saidThe Clinton Foundation referred us toCGEPartnership and offered no comment though officials there were copied on emails [ After this fact check published CGEPartnership posted a  for the media and released a legal opinion dated April 29 2015 Thelegal opinion which re-affirmed points in the charitys earlier memo is embedded below The attorneys have nowsaid the provincial law would apply in addition to the prohibition against bartering charitable donor lists under the federal law]The Clinton Foundation said all charities are prohibited from disclosing individual donors without prior permission from each donor under Canadian law It is unclear whether the foundation is referring to federal or provincial law If it is the later the statement would be accurateHowever the charitys own memo says it is operating under federal obligations and its fiduciary duty for its board of directors The federal law does not explicitly ban charities from disclosing individual donor names without permission In fact it only applies to commercial use of personal information The public release of donor names for a non-commercial purpose is not prohibited The charity however interprets the release of donor records as bartering which experts have questionedThe charitys memo notes that under Canadian law donors have the right to privacy and that the board of directors has a fiduciary responsibility to use donors personal information for its own charitable purposes While that may be the case Pallys statement implies that there is a blanket Canadian law that bans charities from disclosing donor information without permission That is not exactly the case()  byAs recently as two weeks ago the president called the allegations that Russia helped him win the 2016 election a hoaxOne of the great hoaxes he said at a campaign rally in AlabamaThe Russia hoax continues now its ads on Facebook What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) As recently asThursday morning Trump seemed to suggest that the Senates top committee looking into Russia was looking into the wrong thingWhy Isnt the Senate Intel Committee looking into the Fake News Networks in OUR country to see why so much of our news is just made up-FAKE Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Congress sees it differently The Senates investigation into Russian meddling and whether Trumps 2016 campaign helped isnt complete but lawmakers announced Wednesday that theyve reached some conclusions and those conclusionscontradict how Trump hasapproached RussiaHere are four things a Republican senator and a Democratic senator say they know about Russia after eight months of investigating hundreds of hours of interviews with more than 100 people and nearly 100000 pages of documents reviewed Sen Richard Burr (R-NC) chairman of the Senate Intelligence CommitteeIn January the US intelligence communityto sabotage the presidential election and help Trump win It was ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin himself We looked into it and theres no reason to doubt that conclusion Burr is saying even though Trump has questioned it several times BurrBurr was urging upcoming campaigns and state election officials to beon high alert that Russiawill try to mess with future elections But his advice could also apply to Trump who has been accused of brushing off the notion of Russia meddlingFacebook was always anti-TrumpThe Networks were always anti-Trump henceFake News (apologized) &  were anti-Trump Collusion Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump)   BurrAt the very least accusations that the Trump campaign worked with Russia are not a hoax Its worth significant time and resources for the SenateIntelligence Committee to continue investigating Same goes for an independent investigation led by special counsel Robert S Mueller III Sen Mark R Warner (D-Va)The senators havent concluded much beyond ruling that Russia meddled in the election and could be trying to do it again  Trump campaign officials meetings with Russians former FBI director James B Comeys allegations that Trump tried to get him to back off Russia and the Republican campaign platforms switch to a Russia-friendly positionBut thesenators were ready to definitively say that Russia did three things in the US election of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign director John Podesta to try to damage Clinton politically either to mess with the voter registration or underminecitizensconfidence that their votes were accurately counted by buying ads and creating fake accounts with the aim to sow chaos or drive division in our countryI fear sometimes if you add up all this there was a decent rate of return Warner saidThe senators said they can certifiably say that Russia did not change any votes that were castStates voter registration systems and the systems that count votes are two different thingsThe consulting firm charged with turning around the troubled United Medical Center has told District officials it will replace the hospitals chief executive The move comes on the heels of six council members filing a resolution disapproving of the proposed $42 million contract for Veritas of Washington LLC to continue its hospital management next year In a letter sent to the citys Department of Health Care Finance this week Veritas president Chrystie Boucre said the company would launch a national search for a new CEO pending approval of the option year of the Veritas contract The removal of current CEO Luis Hernandez is effective immediately she wrote and she has asked the UMC Board to appoint David Boucre her cousin as interim CEOThe news was first reported by the Washington Business JournalVincent Gray the councils health committee chair called the CEO dismissal a Band-Aid approachThe systemic problems go beyond Veritass operational capacity he said in a statement   Veritas a company led by campaign donors to DC Mayor Muriel E Bowser (D) was brought on in April 2016 to stabilize the Southeast hospital But despite already collecting millions from the city it has failed to show measurable improvements Gray and other council members have grown increasingly critical of Veritass handling of UMC the Districts only public hospital and the only full-service one east of the Anacostia River The hospital has long been plagued with financial and quality issues Hernandezs ouster will mean UMC will be searching for its fourth CEO in about two yearsBoucre the pending interim CEO as being in information technology  including work with health insurance companies  and outsourcingHernandezs contract expired on Sept 30 2017 but he will remain with the company to oversee other areas of the Veritas portfolio Chrystie Boucre said in an emailed statement Hernandez lives in Florida but had been flying to the District for the CEO job and staying at an apartment in National Harbor with the city covering his travel and rent expense reports showed Its unclear whether his new role will continue that arrangement  Under management by Veritas the hospital has had a number of high-profile incidentsDistrict regulators closed the hospitals obstetrics wing in August citing dangerous medical errors Those included failures to take basic steps to prevent a newborn from contracting HIV and to properly treat a woman with potentially fatal blood-pressure problems In July a 70-year-old patient died but  and his family said hospital officials lost track of the body for several daysA Washington Post review of public records in September found Veritas failed to meet several city standards for managing the hospital including delivering only $107 million of the $9 million in extra revenue its executives promised to generateGrays committee has scheduled a public roundtable session for Oct 30 to hear from hospital and Veritas employees to determine whether to renew the contract UMC looks forward to the upcoming Councilmember Gray hearing and the opportunity to share with the City Council the initiatives that Veritas has undertaken to improve patient quality and safety Chrystie Boucre said in her emailIn his statement Gray said I have a singular goal with the operations of the UMC which is to preserve lives and improve patient safety I filed a Disapproval Resolution on this Veritas contract because of their consistently poor performance The removal of their CEO is only an attempt to retain their $42 million contract I have yet to see a plan that sets forth a strategic direction on how Veritas will turnaround UMC operationsDC regulators ordered the only full-service hospital in Southeast Washington to stop delivering babies last week because of dangerous mistakes the hospitals staff made with multiple pregnant women and newborns a letter obtained by The Washington Post showsIn one case the hospitals staff members did not take critical steps to prevent the transmission of HIV from an infected mother to her newborn such as delivering by Caesarean section or treating the infant shortly after birth with antiretroviral medication according to the letter written by DC Health Department Director LaQuandra Nesbitt to the hospitals chief executiveIn another a morbidly obese woman who was about 35 weeks pregnant and had come to the hospital with trouble breathing was not properly monitored or treated despite a history of potentially fatal blood-pressure problemsThe letter does not state what happened to either woman or to the newborn or fetus and does not identify them by name  The Aug 7 letter provides the first official explanation  albeit an incomplete one  of why the Health Department took the dramatic step that day of  at United Medical Center a public hospital that serves the poor and predominantly African American residents of the neighborhoods east of the Anacostia RiverOfficials in Mayor Muriel E Bowsers administration and Nesbitt an appointed member of her Cabinet have refused repeated requests from journalists and DC Council members to disclose the medical lapses that caused the closing of the hospitals delivery rooms and nursery They have also declined to release the letter obtained by The PostIn an interview Friday Nesbitt repeatedly refused to say why her staff had shuttered the public hospitals obstetrics ward asserting that to do so would violate the confidentiality of patientsWe found things that led us to decisions to restrict the hospitals license to not provide scheduled deliveries and the subsequent newborn nursery services that would occur Nesbitt said declining to specify what those issues werePressed about public concern over medical lapses at the hospital Nesbitt was firmTheres a difference between using the word conceal as a journalist and recognizing that a government has the legal right not to disclose certain information she said when asked why health officials were concealing the medical mistakes they discoveredHospital managers have also not publicly disclosed details surrounding the closure saying in  it had been caused by three separate cases involving deficiencies in screening clinical assessment and delivery protocolsThe statement said federal privacy laws preclude sharing specific details of these cases however UMC is taking immediate action to address these deficienciesHealth policy experts said it was not unusual for government officials to be tight-lipped about reasons for shuttering or restricting hospital services although inspection records are generally public The federal Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services for example posts inspection reports online for some hospitalsToo often however patients privacy is used as a pretext for withholding information the public deserves to know said Rosemary Gibson a patient advocate and adviser at the Hastings Center research groupThe entire system is based on trust Without being completely open and honest with the public how can the public know if a place can be trusted Gibson said If there was a single patient or very small number of patients patient privacy might come in to play But most often patient privacy becomes a cloak of secrecy to prevent the public from knowing risks that were allowed to festerDC Council member Vincent C Gray (D-Ward 7) the councils health committee chairman said in a statement Monday that the Health Departments refusal to disclose information to lawmakers or the public was unacceptableNesbitts letter to hospital chief executive Luis A Hernandez written in highly technical medical language does not answer key questions about lapses in the obstetrics ward  including what happened to the mothers and infants who were involved in those lapsesThe letter lays out two categories of violations failure to comply with standards of good medical practice and failure to report a case of HIV infectionIn the case of a woman referred to only as Patient A who was infected with HIV and had a high viral load at the time of delivery the letter states that the hospital did not deliver her baby by Caesarean section which  the virus will be transmitted to the babyThe hospital also did not conduct a common test for the presence of HIV in newborn or treat the infant with the antiretroviral drug Nevirapine between 48 and 72 hours after birth as recommended Nor did it report the mothers HIV infection to the Health Department as required by lawHospital staff members did not properly monitor a second woman Patient B who was about 35 weeks pregnant and was in acute respiratory distress when she came for treatment The woman had a history of  a blood-pressure condition that can be fatal for both mother and baby In a third case a newborn referred to as Infant A was not physically screened at the right time after birth Emma Brown contributed to this reportDanish inventor Peter Madsen contends he did not kill

prosecutorsaidMadsens defense attorney Betina Hald Engmarktold Swedish newspaper that her client is not quite like other people While he has different sexual preferences that does not make him a murderer she saidAccording to  who attended the hearing Madsen was dressed in army fatigues anddisplayed astoic expression in his court appearanceThe court ordered that Madsen be held in custody for four more weeks and undergo a psychiatric evaluation If convicted Madsen could face five years to life in prison His next court date is Oct 3  Now that he remains jailed we can go further with the investigation Buch-Jepsen said Hundreds of people have called police in recent weeks reporting to have information relevant to the case Authorities still have numerous witness to interview and evidence to uncover Buch-Jepsen saidPolice are still looking for the rest of Walls remains which could provide leads to her cause of deathIn the days after Wall disappeared her friends and family were shocked Compared to other destinationsWall had reported from the coast of Denmark appearedrelatively safe It was less than 30 miles from her Swedish home town and in a country ranking among the worlds safestShe trusted somebody and then this is what happened Christopher Harressan Alabama-based reporter and good friend of Wall told Wall had been pursuing a story about Madsen an amateur rocket builder and well known fanatical character in Denmark His submarinewasdescribed on its website as one of the worlds largest home-built submarinesMadsen initially told authoritieshedropped Wall off

Bowser (D) and a delegation of 23 city representatives are taking a weekend jaunt to Paris to pitch the nations capital as host of the Gay Games 2022 a quadrennial Olympics-like event focused on the LGBT communityThe District is one of three finalists bidding to host the games competing against Hong Kong and Guadalajara Mexico Paris is hosting the games in August 2018 and the Federation of Gay Games is set to select the 2022 host city Monday in the French capitalThe DC delegation left Thursday and will make its pitch in front of a federation committee The group will return MondayBowser said the event would be a financial boon to the city with more than 15000 participants and tens of thousands of spectators likely to attend the games She said the city has committed to putting $2million toward the gamesWe think especially now it is important for the United States to demonstrate that it is an open and welcoming place and it is especially important for us as Washingtonians to show that we are an international city and we celebrate sport Bowser saidThe DC Gay Games Bid Committee paid for the travel to Paris with no cost to taxpayers said Brent Miner chairman of the committee Miner said Washington has 34 gay sports leagues and all have raised funds for the trip The bid also has corporate sponsors including United Airlines and Hilton  Were making our way to Paris on Jell-O shots Miner said of one fundraising method Its fabulousBowser noted that the city has experience handling the security and demands that come with hosting major events In January the District hosted the presidential inauguration and next year it will host the Major League Baseball All-Star Game The District also made unsuccessful bids to host the 2024 Olympics and the 2014 Gay GamesEvents for the Gay Games would mostly be staged in the District although some such as swimming sailing and a triathlon would be in Maryland and Virginia The opening ceremonies would be at the yet-to-be-completed DC United Stadium in Southwest Washington which is expected to be finished next yearAccording to the citys plans the competitions would take place at parks and on the Mall as well as at Gallaudet University and private establishments The billiards competition for instance is planned for Buffalo Billiards in Dupont Circle  The Districts bid application highlighted the citys public transportation system amenities and its ability to lure touristsOur ability to attract large numbers of attendees from around the globe with our international status compelling programs and exciting competitions will drive attendance and visibility for future games the citys presentation pitch Participation in the games is open to anyone and teams fill up on a first-come-first-served basis Each country has its own team although some have multiple teamsMiner who has participated in the Gay Games in the past said the delegation would make a 90-minute presentation in Paris explaining why Washington should host the games then answer questions from decision-makers He said the delegations size displays how deep the Districts support is for hosting the games and shows the international delegation who it would work with if the city is selectedCouncil members Jack Evans (D-Ward 1) and Brandon T Todd (D-Ward 4) along with Sheila Alexander-Reid director of the Mayors Office of LGBTQ Affairs were among those traveling to Paris Others in the delegation included community members and tourism industry leadersFor many who grew up in the LGBT community we may not have had as many opportunities to compete in sports because we either didnt feel comfortable or welcome Miner said So for many it is an opportunity to live out that part of their life that they did not experienceChairing the Democratic National Committee cant be all that Debbie Wasserman Schultz had hoped it would Shes weathered slights and rebukes by the barrel and gets virtually no credit for any electoral gains Democrats have made during her time at the top of the partyAnd this week was particularly indicative of her tumultuous time as DNC chair and why the 2016 election cant come soon enough for herIt all began last weekend when At issue was the disqualification of 50-plus Sanders delegates by the convention credentials committee which was evenly split between Clinton and Sanders supporters The Sanders people were not happy and they got aggressiveWasserman Schultz went on CNN to blast Sanders for not directly condemning the actions of some of his supporters Unfortunately the senators response was anything but acceptable  It certainly did not condemn hissupporters for acting violently   and instead added more fuel to the fireSuddenly Wasserman Schultz was the story Liberals especially those aligned with Sanders had long believed that the Florida congresswoman (and the broader DNC apparatus she helms) had been working stealthily to elect Clinton even while maintaining neutrality in publicI dont think she was fair liberal commentator Van Jones said of Wasserman Schultz I think she actually made it worse nowMorning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski said Wasserman Schultz should resign alleging along-standingfavoritism for ClintonThis has been very poorly handled from the start  It has been unfair and they havent taken him seriously and it starts quite frankly with the person that we just heard speaking [Wasserman Schultz]It just does    She should step down She should step downWasserman Schultzs week got worse On Thursday Clinton sat for an interview with CNN in which  offering a not-so-subtle signal to the Vermont senator that it was time to goSenator Sanders has to do his part Clinton said Thats why the lesson of 2008 which was a hard-fought primary as you remember is so pertinent here Because I did my partNegotiating that detente is fraught with political peril particularly given just how nasty the race got this past week The responsibility to find that brokered peace falls at least in part to Wasserman Schultz Which means she may well have a few more rough weeks in front of herNearly six weeksafter the headless torso of journalist Kim Wall was found in waters off Copenhagen authorities said they foundvideo footage of women being tortured and decapitated on a computer hard drive reportedly belonging to the suspect in the case according toThat suspect prominent Danish inventor Peter Madsen has changed his story many times since Wall boarded his personal submarineto interview him on Aug 10 Wall was never seen alive again Her headless mutilated torso turned up nearly two weeks later Authorities said the torso was bound to heavy metalto make it sink  In a court hearing on Tuesday prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen said that officers found images onMadsens computer  which we presume to be real  of women being strangled decapitated and burned  The videos were found in a laboratory run by MadsenWhile the cause of Walls death hasnt been established Bush-Jepsen said an autopsy showed knife wounds to Walls genitals and rib cage were caused around or shortly after her deathMadsen who has denied charges of killing Wall and mutilating her body said the computer hard drive wasnt his They are the space laboratorys tools which have been used by everyone in the laboratory the 46-year-old inventor said during the pretrial session Wall 30 a freelance journalist from Sweden was researching a story on Madsen andthe UC3 submarine he built at the time of her death She was an  who wrote stories across the globe from Sri Lanka to North Korea  WhenWall didnt return from her interview with Madsen her boyfriend reported her missing At about the same time Madsens prized submarine reportedly sank He initially told police that he had dropped Wall at the Copenhagen harbor and later barely escaped his sinking vesselBut a witness contradicted his story and police accused Madsenof deliberately sinking the vessel which he lateradmittedto doingAfter the submarine was retrieved Walls blood was found inside authorities saidMadsensoon changed his story and told authorities Wall died afterhitting her head on a submarine hatch cover and that he buried her at seaAfter her headless torso was found he denied dismembering her body Police  from the torso to Walls toothbrush and hairbrush as well as the blood in the submarineMadsen was initially charged with involuntarily manslaughter but the charges were later changed to murderIn a court hearing last month the prosecutor summed up his case Two people are on a

taking the use of the cellphone too farRepublican nominee Donald Trump pleaded directly Wednesday with the Russian government to meddle in the US presidential election by finding and releasing tens of thousands of private emails from his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton  an extraordinary and perhaps unprecedented maneuver in American politicsRussia if youre listening I hope youre able to find the 30000 emails that are missing Trump said during a news conference at one of his South Florida resorts He added later They probably have them Id like to have them releasedAsked whether Russian espionage into the former secretary of states correspondence would concern him Trump said No it gives me no pause If they have them they have themThe emails cited by Trump are from Clintons time at the State Department where her use of a private server prompted a federal investigation The FBI concluded that no prosecution was necessaryThose are different than emails from the Democratic National Committee that were leaked ahead of the party convention here possibly with the involvement of Russia The FBI is investigating whether Russian state actors were responsible for leaking the politically damaging messages last Friday in an episode that forced the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman SchultzPresident Obama who was scheduled to address the convention on Wednesday night told NBC News in an on Tuesday that Russia could be working to influence the electionWhat we do know is that the Russians hack our systems not just government systems but private systems Obama said What the motives were in terms of the leaks all that  I cant say directly What I do know is that Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed admiration for Vladimir PutinClinton campaign manager Robby Mook responded to Trumps Wednesday comments with a tone of disbelief telling reporters that the apparent hacking was a national security issueIt appears the Russians did steal these emails from the DNC Mook said at a lunch sponsored by the Wall Street Journal It appears as if they were active in releasing them for the purpose of hurting the campaignBut Rep Devin Nunes (R-Calif) the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said any such speculation is unfounded There is no evidence absolutely no evidence that the Russians are trying to influence the US election he said in an interviewDemocrats have labored all week to put Trump on the defensive over his business and personal ties to Russia as well as his professed admiration for its president Putin as a model leader Some have portrayed Trump as Putins Manchurian candidateVice President Biden roused thousands of delegates at the Democratic National Convention here Wednesday night by excoriating Trump as unfit to be commander in chief We cannot elect a man who belittles our closest allies while embracing dictators like Vladimir Putin he said  The candidate and several of his top advisers have business connections to Russia Campaign chairman Paul Manafort has made millions of dollars in business deals with pro-Russia oligarchs as well as advised the Putin-aligned president of Ukraine whose 2014 ouster triggered Russias intervention thereTrump seemingly played into Democratic hands on Wednesday by praising Putins leadership qualities and vowing that US relations with Russia would improve if he is elected in NovemberI dont think Putin has any respect whatsoever for Clinton Trump said He added He has a total lack of respect for President Obama  I think hes going to respect your president if Im elected And I hope he likes meIn a series of afternoon tweets Trump spokesman Jason Miller said the candidate was merely encouraging other countries to turn over any information relating to Clintons emails to US authoritiesTo be clear Mr Trump did not call on or invite Russia or anyone else to hack Hillary Clintons emails today Miller wrote  Still Trumps provocation alarmed many Republican leaders and foreign policy experts  not only for his disjointed discussion of Russia but also for the signal it sent about their standard-bearers worldview Many were also alarmed by Trumps remark Wednesday that he would be  whether Crimea which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014 should be recognized as Russian territory He has repeatedly questioned the need for NATO the main Western bulwark against Russia He told an Ohio rally crowd Wednesday night that if a nation has not paid enough toward defense costs asks for help he would respond Bye byeRather than approaching Russia with trepidation Trump embraced Putin as a future ally and said he hoped to develop a chummy and mutually beneficial rapport with one of the globes notorious strongmen In doing so Trump broke with decades of Republican instincts that were honed during Ronald Reagans presidency at the end of the Cold WarForeign governments sometimes express preferences about who should be elected thats already problematic said Eliot A Cohen a former counselor in George W Bushs State Department But to do something in the nature of dirty tricks would be a very very serious problemTrumps running mate Indiana Gov Mike Pence issued a statement minutes after Trumps remarks that hewed closely to established GOP orthodoxy Instead of baiting the Russians to reveal Clintons emails Pence said that the FBI must get to the bottom of who is behind the hackingIf it is Russia and they are interfering in our elections I can assure you both parties and the United States government will ensure there are serious consequences the statement continuedIt was unclear whether Trumps declaration would hurt or help him politically Such comments by a normal candidate in a normal election year would be a seminal and possibly fatal episode Yet neither Trump nor this year are typical  and as with past controversies voters may not take Trumps commentary seriouslyPartisan figures rallied immediately to Trumps defense blaming the mainstream media for blowing Trumps comments out of proportion and trying to shift the focus from Clintons judgmentWhats irresponsible is that more than 30000 emails were deleted by a crook who broke the law former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga) said in an interview I dont care if its the Bulgarians the Chinese or Haitian immigrants studying at Stanford Lets see the 30000 emailsVeteran GOP strategist Mike Murphy said many longtime Republicans were appalled by Trumps gambitThis is what happens when you nominate an egomaniacal bozo as your candidate for president of the United States Murphy said He has jumped the shark into complete embarrassmentOn the convention stage here this week Clintons supporters have tried to cast Trump as a pawn in Russias global ambitionsReacting to Trumps Wednesday comments former defense secretary Leon E Panetta said As someone who was responsible for protecting our nation from cyberattacks its inconceivable to me that any presidential candidate would be that irresponsibleRetired admiral John Hutson was more pointed This morning he personally invited Russia to hack us Thats not law and order thats criminal intent  Trump has repeatedly tried to do business in Russia and Russian investors have been important to his real estate empire particularly in recent yearsAccording to litigation filed in Florida Trumps partners on a Panama project traveled to Moscow in 2006 to sell condos to Russian investors Trump also sold a mansion in Palm Beach in 2008 for $95million to Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev he had purchased the home at a bankruptcy auction four years earlier for $414millionTrump has also sought to build a tower in Moscow numerous times since the late 1980s when he said he had a deal to explore a Trump project in partnership with the Soviet government His most recent effort came after a Putin ally Aras Agalarov known as the Trump of Russia paid Trump millions to bring the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow in 2013 Agalarov has told The Washington Post that he signed a preliminary deal to bring a Trump project to the Russian capitalWe will be in Moscow at some point Trump promised in a 2007 depositionAlan Garten general counsel for the Trump Organization also outlined the companys interest in Russia to The Post in May Were always looking to expand and do projects all over the world I have no doubt as a company I know weve looked at deals in Russia And many of the former Russian republics he saidTrump tried to swat away several questions from reporters on Wednesday about his ties to Russia I have nothing to do with Russia he told one journalist How many times do I have to say that Are you a smart man I have nothing to do with RussiaTrump has also surrounded himself with aides with ties to Russia in addition to Manafort One of his foreign policy advisers Carter Page once ran the Moscow office of Merrill Lynch and has advised Russian oil giant Gazprom Page has said his Russian business associates are excited at the prospect that a Trump presidency would result in the end of Ukraine-related sanctions on Russia which has crimped their businessAnother Trump adviser retired Lt Gen Michael Flynn who was on his shortlist of potential running mates has advocated for a stronger alliance with Moscow to fight Islamic State terrorists Flynn sat near Putin at a 2015 dinner in Moscow honoring RT an English-language media service aligned with the KremlinAt his news conference Wednesday Trump imagined his presidency ushering in an era of good relations with RussiaI would treat Vladimir Putin firmly but theres nothing that I can think of that Id rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now so that we can go and knock out ISIS together with other people and with other countries Trump said Wouldnt it be nice if we actually got along with people DelReal reported from Milwaukee Rosalind S Helderman in Washington and Tom Hamburger and Anne Gearan in Philadelphia contributed to this reportThe Justice Department appointed a special counsel Wednesday to investigate possible coordination between President Trumps associates and Russian officials  a clear signal to the White House that federal investigators will aggressively pursue the matter despite the presidents insistence that there was no collusion with the KremlinRobert S Mueller III a former prosecutor who served as the FBI director from 2001 to 2013 has agreed to take over the investigation as a special counsel Deputy Attorney General Rod J Rosenstein announced The move marks a concession by the Trump administration to Democratic demands for the investigation to be run independently of the Justice Department Calls for a special counsel intensified after  last week   In my capacity as acting attorney general I determined that it is in the public interest for me to exercise my authority and appoint a special counsel to assume responsibility for this matter Rosenstein said in a statement My decision is not a finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted I have made no such determination What I have determined is that based upon the unique circumstances the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of commandMueller often described by those who worked for him as a stern and press-averse disciplinarian issued a characteristically terse statement I accept this responsibility and will discharge it to the best of my abilityTrump reacted to the news by saying a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know  there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity I look forward to this matter concluding quickly In the meantime I will never stop fighting for the people and the issues that matter most to the future of our countryIn a series of tweets early Thursday Trump decried that a special counsel was not named to investigate what he alleged were illegal acts by the Obama administration and the campaign of Hillary Clinton With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration there was never a special councel appointed Trump wrote misspelling the word counselLess than 15 minutes later he tweeted This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American historyThe White House did not learn of Rosensteins decision until just 30 minutes before the public announcement was made Rosenstein called White House Counsel Donald McGahn at 530 pm to inform him at which point McGahn walked downstairs from his second-floor office to the Oval Office to notify TrumpTrump summoned his senior staff to the Oval Office and together they drafted a statement reacting to the decision coming from the president that was distributed to reporters shortly after 7 pm One senior White House official who was present for the discussions described Trump as unbelievably calm and measuredI expected him to be ranting and raving but he was like Fine let them do what they have to do but well be focused on our agenda said this official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private talks Democrats cheered the announcement as a step forward in resolving the unanswered questions about Russian meddling in last years presidential election  and whether the president or anyone at the White House has interfered with the investigation  Sen Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn) said Mueller has the expertise and experience guts and backbone to uncover the truth He said Mueller must be given all the resources necessary to pursue the facts wherever they lead including whether anyone may have tried to obstruct justiceRep Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee cheered the choice writing on Twitter Impeccable credentials Should be widely acceptedBut some Democrats said Muellers appointment does not preclude the need for an independent commission to examine Russian interference in the election An independent commission doesnt govern the FBI investigation an independent commission doesnt make charging decisions said Rep Adam B Schiff (Calif) the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee which is conducting its own probe of Russian meddling The value an independent commission adds is you have a body that is truly independent of any political consideration And also has all the resources it needs and a single focus on the oversight of what Russia did how we need to respond in the future and it brings that political independence and staff and resources on task So those are two different needs and I think theyre complementary not in competition with each otherThe special counsel law grants Mueller the authority to probe possible attempts to stymie his investigation The decision to appoint a special counsel comes a day after revelations that  recount a conversation with the president in which Trump asked him to drop an investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn Associates of Comey said he took detailed notes of multiple conversations with the president and lawmakers are now demanding access to those memos and any other related records held at the FBI The decision also comes amid intense pressure on the senior official who has been overseeing the Russia probe Rosenstein to appoint a special counsel Rosenstein was put in charge of the Russia probe after  Democrats have challenged Rosensteins impartiality in the Russia probe because he wrote a memorandum initially used as the rationale for Comeys firing In the memo Rosenstein said Comey had violated long-standing Justice Department practices in his handling of the investigation into Clintons use of a private email server but shortly after the announcement of the firing the president said he had decided to fire Comey before he received the recommendation from RosensteinRosenstein is scheduled to brief the full Senate in a closed session on Thursday Former colleagues said Rosensteins move may help restore his battered reputation among current and former government lawyers He got absolutely pummeled by people that he knows said a former senior Obama administration lawyer who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly I think this move as so often happens in Washington where there is the opportunity to wash away your sins was a thorough scrubbingUnder the order signed Wednesday by Rosenstein Mueller is tasked with investigating any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump as well as any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation and any other matters that fall under the scope of the Justice Department regulation covering special counsel appointmentsIt wasnt immediately clear from the language of the order where Mueller might draw the lines as to which matters are related to the Russia investigationThat language seems to suggest that Mueller could also take over ongoing investigations into leaks of classified information connected to the Russia probe As the FBI director Mueller assiduously discouraged leaks by his subordinates and oversaw investigations that sought to criminally charge leakers of government secrets If the special counsel believes it is necessary and appropriate the special counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters the order statesAnother potential legal complication could arise from the law firm where Mueller worked until his appointment as special counsel That firm WilmerHale has represented  who has been under investigation relating to his work and payments for advising Ukrainian government officials Officials referred questions about possible recusals on those subjects to Mueller who didnt respond to requests for commentOfficials said the appointment was being made under a Justice Department statute that has only been used once in 1999 although the Justice Department has made other special counsel appointments more recently under different authority Peter Zeidenberg who has worked for a past special counsel called Mueller an inspired choice because he comes to the job with automatic credibility among both partiesHes nominally a Republican but hes really not a political person at all said Zeidenberg a lawyer now in private practice who cautioned that such an investigation is likely to take a long time and may not ultimately satisfy the publics demand for a full accounting People are waiting for public answers to what happened but thats not his job There wont be a report or a news conference at the end of this from him thats not his role When he was FBI director Mueller worked closely for a time with Comey  who as deputy attorney general was nominally Muellers boss during the George W Bush administration  and while the two men agree on much they have very different personalities Mueller was a harsh taskmaster who eschewed expressions of warmth with his staff Comey in contrast has written holiday greetings to staff that have been described as moving The special counsel gets money and personnel from the Justice Department but Mueller can ask for specific individuals to join the case WilmerHale lawyers James Quarles and Aaron Zebley also stepped down from WilmerHale Wednesday and a firm spokesman said they were expected to join Mueller Zebley a former FBI agent and assistant US attorney was Muellers chief of staff at the FBI Quarles was an assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force Given the extremely sensitive nature of the counterintelligence probe it is likely that Mueller will also work with many of the current FBI agents assigned to the case although the decision is ultimately his to make The budget for the investigation will still have to be approved by RosensteinIn his new role Mueller answers to and in theory could be fired by Rosenstein but in practice a special counsel is not subject to daily supervision by any Justice Department official And given that Muellers appointment came about largely because of the firing of the FBI director it would probably touch off a new political firestorm if Mueller were ever dismissed Philip Rucker Ellen Nakashima and Julie Tate contributed to this reportTwo days after the presidential election a Russian official speaking to a reporter in Moscow offered a surprising acknowledgment The Kremlin had been in contact with Donald Trumps campaignThe claim coming amid allegations that Russia had interfered with the election was met with an immediate no-wiggle-room blanket denial from Trumps spokeswoman It never happened Hope Hicks  at the time There was no communication between the campaign and any foreign entity during the campaignIn fact it is now clear it did happenThe past few days have brought a growing list of confirmed communications between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials with each new revelation adding to a cloud of suspicion that hangs over the White House as critics demand an independent investigationTrumps team has offered various explanations for the meetings Some encounters they have said were brief no more than casual polite introductions Others involved the routine diplomacy common for officials surrounding a candidate for the nations highest officeAttorney General Jeff Sessions who was an early Trump campaign adviser said  with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak first reported this week by The Washington Post came in his role as a senator not as a campaign surrogateIt is unclear why the White House has consistently denied contacts with Russian officials if the meetings that took place were innocuous As a result the confirmations of the encounters have trickled out through a series of news stories that have proved increasingly damaging to the Trump administration with some Trump associates appearing to shift their accounts over timeAlready Michael Flynn was  as national security adviser as a result of his post-election contacts with Kislyak This week the White House confirmed that those conversations included a brief meeting alongside Trumps son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner at Trump Tower in New York in December White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Friday termed that discussion merely a courtesy meetingSessions has now  from oversight of any investigation of Trumps ties to Moscow and is facing calls to step down as a result of his statement during his January confirmation hearing that he had not had any contacts with the RussiansOn Friday Sanders dismissed the brewing questions The big point here is the president himself knows what his involvement was and thats zero she saidNevertheless the recent revelations have made the post-election comments from the Russian official newly relevant  came from Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov who told the Interfax news agency in November that there were contacts with Trumps aidesObviously Ryabkov said we know most of the people from his entourageAs the Trump campaign rejected the assertion other Russian officials said any communications would have been routine and offered to Democratic nominee Hillary Clintons campaign as well  a contention denied at the time by a Clinton aideNearly all of the contacts that have emerged so far were with Kislyak the affable Russian ambassador in Washington who is known as a consummate networker  Kislyak appears to have worked to cultivate a relationship with the Trump campaign starting his outreach even before Trump was thought likely to win the GOP nominationIn April Kislyak popped up at the Mayflower Hotel where he was seated in the front row at one of Trumps first major foreign policy addresses During the speech Trump offered a forceful promise that he would seek better relations with RussiaI believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia  from a position of strength only  is possible absolutely possible he saidThe events host Dimitri K Simes president of the Center for the National Interest a foreign policy think tank said Kislyak was one of four ambassadors who attended as guests of his group Simes said he introduced Trump and Kislyak in a receiving line at a reception before the event which was also attended by Sessions and Kushner among other Trump aidesSimes who is Russian American and favors warmer relations with Moscow said it is common practice for foreign diplomats to try to get to know important advisers like Sessions to presidential candidates Let me put it more bluntly They would be derelict in their duty if they didnt try to get to know him Simes saidKislyak was also in attendance at the Republican National Convention where he briefly  after a July 18 Heritage Foundation event attended by dozens of diplomatsTwo days later Kislyak met with Trump advisers Carter Page and JD Gordon after a convention-related Global Partners in Diplomacy event at Case Western Reserve UniversityIn an email Gordon said he briefly spoke to Kislyak in a group of diplomats there and also at an evening reception Gordon called it a brief informal conversation during which he repeated public Trump statements about improving relations with RussiaPage also confirmed his interaction with Kislyak at the event to MSNBC on Thursday Last month he told PBS that he had held no meetings with any Russian officials during the campaignThose meetings at the Republican convention came as questions about Trumps stance on Russia started to seriously enter campaign trail conversationAt the time some GOP delegates were questioning the wording of the party platform and whether the Trump campaign had intervened to make it more Russia friendly A delegates proposal regarding US support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia-backed rebels had been softened before inclusion in the document Then-campaign manager Paul Manafort who previously was  to a pro-Russian Ukrainian president told NBC in August that the change absolutely did not come from the campaignBut this week Gordon the Trump campaign adviser offered a different explanation He said he had advocated for the change believing it to match Trumps views In an email he said he had consulted about the matter with campaign policy colleagues before arriving in ClevelandPages participation in the July meeting came 13 days after he drew scrutiny for a July 8 speech he delivered in Moscow in which he was critical of US foreign policyPage has denied holding substantive meetings with Russian officials during that trip but told The Post in September that he briefly met and shook hands with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich after his address Page told MSNBC on Thursday that he held no material discussions during the trip  Russias alleged interference in the US election exploded as a public issue a few days after Page and Gordon met with Kislyak On July 22 WikiLeaks posted thousands of emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee causing recriminations in the party on the eve of its national conventionRather than condemning the possible intervention in the election by a foreign power Trump playfully called on the Russians to hack Clintons private server and locate emails she had deleted Russia if youre listening I hope youre able to find the 30000 emails that are missing  at a July 27 news conferenceSessions met with Kislyak in his office on Capitol Hill on Sept8 as US officials were growing more concerned about Russias role in the election He said Thursday that the meeting came in his role as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee noting that it was one of many such meetings he took with diplomatsSanders the White House spokeswoman told reporters Friday that suspicions about the meeting were pretty unfair given that Sessionss senatorial duties put him in touch routinely with diplomatsBut a survey by The Post of all 26 members of the committee showed that Sessions was the only one to meet one-on-one with Kislyak in 2016 And a Polish diplomat  in late spring said he did so at Sessionss request at least in part because of Sessionss role with TrumpI was aware that Sessions was a senator and at the same time somebody close to Donald Trump I just wanted to hear what he wanted to say  any message communication questions said Ryszard Schnepf who was ambassador at the time and has since retired He declined to say what he and Sessions discussed except to say the issues would have been of interest to a senator at the same time as [a surrogate] for somebody who is running for presidentIn a brief interview last month Kislyak told The Post that he had also had communications with Flynn before the election He declined to detail them Its something all diplomats do he said        Greg Miller contributed to this reportPresident Trump  as director of the FBI citing Comeys handling of the agencys investigation into Hillary Clintons private email serverby deputy attorney general Rod J Rosenstein the White House citedtwo key developments in the investigationThe first was Comeys news conference on July 5 2016 when he announced that the FBI would not recommend criminal charges against Clinton for her use of a private email server as secretary of state Rosenstein wrote in hismemo The Director was wrong to usurp the Attorney Generals authority on July 5 2016 and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution It is not the function of the Director to make such an announcement At most the Director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutorsThe other was a letter Comey wrote to members of Congress on Oct 28 2016 notifying them that the FBI was resuming its email probe Comey defended this decision saying that not disclosing the information would have been to conceal the information Rosenstein challenged Comeys view arguing that quietly opening an investigation is not concealing anything we are simply following the long-standing policy that we refrain from publicizing non-public informationBased on Rosensteins letter  in which he said Comeys decisions were indefensible and damaged the credibility and reputation of the agency  Attorney General Jeff Sessions recommended Trump remove Comey Trump dismissed Comey later that dayThis made us wonder How does the decision by Trump and Sessions in May 2017 comport with their rhetoric about Comeys handling of the investigationOn July 5 Comey  in handling classified material but investigators did not find intentional mishandling of classified informationThen-Attorney General Loretta E Lynch had said  amid criticisms of her private meeting with Bill Clinton while the investigation was still underwayThat evening Trump said he was surprised by Comeys recommendation saying he believed Clinton had criminal intent He implied the former president influenced the investigation by meeting with Lynch But when asked whether hed fire Lynch and Comey Trump didnt give a definitive answer   Trump repeatedly criticized Lynch and Comey  but not for the reasons hed use to fire Comey 10 months later Instead Trump thought Comey should have brought criminal charges against Clinton tweeting it was a #RiggedSystemNeither was Sessions immediately critical of Comeys decision to make the announcement separate from Lynch He said it was a difficult case From his July 7 2016 interview on Fox News with Greta Van Susteren   Two weeks later Sessions still didnt criticize Comey for acting out of line From his July 20 2016 interview on Fox News Trump and Clinton officially became their parties presidential nominees by August 2016 Sessions was one of Trumps most active surrogates slamming Clinton over her use of a private server and contributions to the Clinton FoundationDuring a CNN interview on Aug 23 2016 Sessions would not answer whether he trusted Comeys conclusions in the email investigation   Trump continued to complain about Comey  but again not for the reason hed use later to fire Comey During an Oct 13 2016 rally in West Palm Beach Fla Trump claimed FBI employees are embarrassed and ashamed of what Comey had done because he wasnt harsh enough on Clinton Then on Oct 28  informing them that the agency found new information relating to the Clinton email case and needed to assess whether they are relevantThis time Trump and Sessions agreed with Comeys decision Seven months later both men would blame Comey for this decision and use it to justify his dismissalHowever in that same Lou Dobbs Tonight interview Sessions said it was the attorney generals job to decide whether or not to prosecute  not Comeys This is consistent with his view in May 2017  Two days before the Nov 8 election Sessions again said Comey did the right thing by disclosing new evidence But he again said the attorney general should have been the one to make the final call However in this case a special prosecutor would be necessary because of Lynchs meeting with Bill Clinton Sessions said in a Nov 6 2016 interview on Fox News (The day before Sessions Rudolph W Giuliani and Frank Keating about this)As president-elect Trump equivocated on whether he would fire Comey From his Nov 13 2016 interview on 60 Minutes     After that Trump sent mixed signals about Comey in interviews and on Twitter Heres a sampling of his various statements (Our colleague Jenna Johnson chronicled )For example heres an April 12 2017 interview with Fox Business Networks Maria Bartiromo But then Trump changed his mind by May 2 2017 when he  (An  issued by the White House suggests Trump was strongly inclined to remove him after watching Comeys testimony on May 3)Exactly one week later Trump fired ComeyTo justify Comeys firing the administration cited two reasons Comey shouldnt have announced on July 5 that the Clinton investigation should be closed without prosecution and he didnt necessarily need to disclose on Oct 28 about the new development in the caseTrump and Sessions both criticized the outcome of the investigation announced on July 5 but did not immediately criticize him for usurping Lynchs authority as they did in May 2017 However Sessions ultimately did criticize the chain of command in the process Theres no clear flip-flop by both menAs for Comeys Oct 28 decision both Trump and Sessions defended it in the following days But as president-elect and into his presidency Trump remained skeptical of Comeys judgment throughoutthe Clinton probe By May 2017 the two men found Comeys Oct 28 letter no longer necessary This is inconsistent with the times they defended Comey for the letterWhile there are inconsistencies in both mens rhetoric compared with their decisions on May 2017 both have remained skeptical of Comeys judgment and role throughout the process So this does not quite amount to a flip-flop meriting an Upside-Down Pinocchio In the absence of a rating such as atPolitiFact we will not rate this claim()President Trump and his surrogates are attacking the judgment and independence of former FBI director Robert S Mueller III the special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation and related matters They are criticizing the political contributions of some of the attorneys hired to Muellers team questioning the investigators independenceTrump claimedthe attorneys are all supporters of Hillary Clinton and worked for her The ad described the hires as a part of a rigged gameLets dig into itThe attacks aimed at discrediting Mueller one month into his special investigation are similar to efforts by former president Bill Clintons supporterstwo decades ago Democrats at the timeKenneth Starr special counsel whose investigations ultimately led to Clintons impeachment in the House They painted Starr as an unethical investigator with a conflict of interest conducting a Mueller has hired 13 attorneys and is expected to hire more Most are veteran attorneys at the Justice Department or the FBI or attorneys Mueller worked with at the WilmerHale law firm which he left in May when The members Four (Quarles Weissmann Rhee Prelogar) have made political contributions to Democrats and four (Zebley Dreeben Page Jed) have no record of making political contributions Previous news reports incorrectly identified Dreeben as a Democratic donor mistaking him for a furniture designer in Chicago named Michael W DreebenQuarles gave the most political donations out of the four  nearly$33000 to various Democrats since 1999 Federal Election Commission records show Recipients included Obama for America Hillary for America and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign CommitteeQuarles is the only one who donated to Republicans In 2005 he gave $250 to then-Sen George Allen of VirginiaIn 2015 he gave $2500 to Jason Chaffetz the Utah Republican and chairman of the House Oversight Committee who later wouldinvestigate Hillary Clintons private email server useWeissmann donated $4300 total to the Obama Victory Fund in 2008 $2300 to the Clinton campaign in 2007 and the Democratic National Committee in 2006 Rhee gave $5400 total to Hillary for America in 2015 and 2016 $4800 total in 2008 and 2011 to the Obama Victory Fund and $250 to the DNCin 2004 (Quarles and Rhee gave maximum contributions of $2700 to Clintons 2016 presidential campaign)Prelogar donated $500 total to Obama Victory fund in 2012 and Hillary for America in 2016 (Note We corrected an error in the calculation for Rhees donations to the Obama Victory Fund)Rhee was a partner on the defense team  in a lawsuit over Clintons use of her private email server Zebley once represented a Clinton aide at WilmerHale So Trump twisted the facts Not all of Muellers hires supported Clinton and none of them worked for Clinton directlyThe White House did not provide an explanation of Trumps claimA Great America Alliance spokesman said the ads message is that hiring four high-profile attorneys who contributed to Democrats means Mueller cannot credibly claim to conduct an investigation without some inherent bias or conflictAn independent investigation should actually be independent and Mr Mueller is failing to achieve that standard the spokesman said Stacking the investigative team with political opponents of the president will not achieve an unbiased result and we are committed to exposing this realityBut that overlooks important context  the Justice Department from considering the political affiliation or political contributions of career appointees including those appointed to the Special Counsels Office So the implication that Mueller is making politically motivated hires is quite a stretch as he is legally prohibited from considering their political affiliationsUnder the Rules of Professional Responsibility attorneys are permitted to participate in matters involving their former firms clients so long as they have no confidential information about the client and did not participate in the representation said Peter Carr spokesman for the Special Counsels Office Moreoverattorneys are bound by confidentiality rules and may not useinformation they learned from one client (say Clinton Foundation) and divulge it in another case (say the Russia probe)The Justice Departments ethics experts found Mueller and those he hired from his former firm are consistent with DOJ rules Carr said This was despite concerns over WilmerHales representation of Trumps former campaign manager Paul Manafort son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka TrumpThat Rhee represented the Clinton Foundation is irrelevant said Stephen Gillers expert in legal ethics at the New York University School of LawThe Mueller investigation is not about Clintons emails The two matters are apples and oranges A lawyer could work on bothIn fact the lead defense attorney that Rhee worked with on the Clinton Foundation case now represents Kushner and Ivanka TrumpTrump mischaracterized the donations from Muellers attorneys and falsely claimed some even worked for Hillary Clinton Four out of eight attorneys made public so far have contributed to Democrats including Clinton and Obama The other four have no record of political contributionsOne attorney who donatedthe maximum amount to Clintons 2016 presidential campaign represented the Clinton Foundation in a 2015 lawsuit Another attorney who made no political donations represented a Clinton aide at one point Both attorneys worked for WilmerHale a firm that also represents Trumps former campaign manager daughter and son-in-lawFurther Trump and the ad use these political contributions to suggestbias orconflict of interest But that twists the facts that misleads the public to believe there is something nefarious going on Legally and under federal ethics rules there is no conflict of interest The DOJ is legally barred from discriminating career appointees based on political affiliation so Mueller cant decide his team based on their contributions That half of the publicly named special counsel attorneys donated to Democrats is not an indication that Mueller has failed to achieve a standard of independence We award Three Pinocchios()Do you rate this claim as true or false More Pinocchios for false fewer based on your opinion of the statements truthfulness (The check mark means you think the statement is true not that you agree with the rating)We need to verify that you are an actual person This is a non-scientific user poll Results are not statistically valid and cannot be assumed to reflect the views of Washington Post users as a group or the general populationDonald Trump just walked into another political and foreign policy minefield of his own makingTrump saidWednesday that he hopes a country that just happens to be one of the United States most antagonistic fellow world powers Russia has or would obtain unreleased emails from Hillary Clintons tenure as secretary of stateThey probably have her 33000 emails too I hope they do he said adding later Russia if youre listening I hope youre able to find the 30000 emails that are missing I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our pressThere are many many potential problems with this scenario and not just for Clintons campaign but also for US national security Indeedthe logical extension of his comments is that a foreign power would be deciding how to handle possiblysensitive information about a potential US presidentAnd none other than Trump himself has suggested this kind of information could be First a little background Trump here is referring to approximately half of  on the private server that Clinton used as secretary of state and thatwere deleted because they were deemed personal and not turned over to State Department investigators Republicans have cried foul over their deletionTrump seemed to imply later Wednesday in a tweet that he simply wanted the emails to be turned over to the FBI no matter who might obtain themIf Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clintons 33000 illegally deleted emails perhaps they should share them with the FBI Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) But Trumps comments earlier Wednesday suggested Russia might hand the emails over to the news media as WikiLeaks did with hacked Democratic National Committee emails last week As it did with the committee  except this time for a former top USdiplomat who could soon be presidentAnd hehas said previously in this campaign without any evidence that enemies of the United States almost certainly haveaccessed Clintons emails and  So hes clearly aware of that possibilityFBI Director James B Comey said in rebuking Clintons use of the email server earlier this month that  but that there was no evidence yet that it had happenedGiven that combination of factors we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clintons personal email account he saidTrumps aimhere seems to be highlighting that Clinton deleted her emails full stop If Russia can find them after all maybe they will come to light he seems to suggestBut that scenario could also very plausibly lend itself to the kind of cyberespionage blackmail or otherwise that Trump has already alleged Clinton is being subjected toThe emails were deemed personal and should not contain classified information Yes but many work-related emails Clinton said did not contain classified information were later proven by the FBI to have contained some And even if the information is all personal in nature that could be used against Clinton tooTrump literally just invited ad encouraged Russia to commit cyberespionage on his political rival Simon Maloy (@SimonMaloy) How is calling for a cyberattack from a foreign power anything but treasonous Douglas Heye (@DougHeye) Trump of course has gone far outside the mainstream on foreign policy before He has basically said he might unilaterally pull the United States out of its obligation to defend other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) when they are attacked if they dont foot more of the bill for the organizationWere talking about countries that are doing very well he  Then yes I would be absolutely prepared to tell those countries Congratulations you will be defending yourselfThe comment earned stern rebukes from all sides of the USforeign-policy debate and foreign leaders The message it sends to allies experts said is that the United States  which would be a major problem for the United States standing in the world and for maintaining and buildingrelationships with alliesSo Trump is clearly not abiding by the standard protocol of USofficials who talkcarefully about foreign policyBut Wednesdays comments ratchet things up even more Even as he contended that hes not the preferred candidate of Russia  as  hes now hoping Russia has potentially damaging information about a possible US presidentThats stunningAnd while Trump did not say he wants Russia to use those emails for blackmail or espionage purposes his previous comments make clear its a possibility hes very well aware ofDonald Trump outlined an unabashedly noninterventionist approach to world affairs Monday telling The Washington Posts editorial board that he questions the need for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization which has formed the backbone of Western security policies since the Cold WarThe meeting at The Post covered a range of issues including media libel laws violence at his rallies climate change NATO and the US presence in AsiaSpeaking ahead of a major address on foreign policy later Monday in front of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee Trump said he advocates a light footprint in the worldIn spite of unrest abroad especially in the Middle East Trump said the United States must look inward and steer its resources toward rebuilding domestic infrastructure  I do think its a different world today and I dont think we should be nation-building anymore Trump said I think its proven not to work and we have a different country than we did then We have $19 trillion in debt Were sitting probably on a bubble And its a bubble that if it breaks its going to be very nasty I just think we have to rebuild our countryHe added I watched as we built schools in Iraq and theyre blown up We build another one we get blown up We rebuild it three times and yet we cant build a school in Brooklyn We have no money for education because we cant build in our own country At what point do you say Hey we have to take care of ourselves So I know the outer world exists and Ill be very cognizant of that But at the same time our country is disintegrating large sections of it especially the inner citiesFor the first time Trump also listed members of a team chaired by Sen Jeff Sessions (R-Ala) that is counseling him on foreign affairs and helping to shape his policies Keith Kellogg Carter Page George Papadopoulos Walid Phares and Joseph E SchmitzTrump praised George P Shultz who served as President Ronald Reagans top diplomat and was harshly critical of current secretary of state John F Kerry He questioned the United States continued involvement in NATO and on the subject of Russias aggression in Ukraine said Americas alliesare not doing anythingUkraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO and yet were doing all of the lifting Trump said Theyre not doing anything And I say Why is it that Germanys not dealing with NATO on Ukraine Why is it that other countries that are in the vicinity of Ukraine why arent they dealing Why are we always the one thats leading potentially the third world war with Russia Trump said thatUS involvement in NATO may need to be significantly diminished in the coming years breaking with nearly seven decades of consensus in Washington We certainly cant afford to do this anymore Trumpsaid adding later NATO is costing us a fortune and yes were protecting Europe with NATO but were spending a lot of moneyTrump sounded a similar note in discussing the US presence in the Pacific He questioned the value of massive military investments in Asia and wondered aloud whether the United States still was capable of being an effective peacekeeping force thereSouth Korea is very rich great industrial country and yet were not reimbursed fairly for what we do Trump said Were constantly sending our ships sending our planes doing our war games  were reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costingAsked whether the United States benefitsfrom its involvement in the region Trump replied Personally I dont think so He added I think we were a very powerful very wealthy country and we are a poor country now Were a debtor nationTrump cast China as a leading economic and geopolitical rival and said the United States should toughen its trade alliances to better competeChina has got unbelievable ambitions Trump said China feels very invincible We have rebuilt China They have drained so much money out of our country that theyve rebuilt China Without us you wouldnt see the airports and the roadways and the bridges The George Washington Bridge [in New York] thats like a trinket compared to the bridges that they build in China We dont build anymore We had our dayTrump began the hour-long meeting by pulling out a list of some of his foreign policy advisersWalid Phares who you probably knowPhD adviser to the House of Representatives Hes a counterterrorism expert Trump said Carter Page PhD George Papadopoulos Hes an oil and energy consultant Excellent guy The honorable Joe Schmitz [was] inspector general at the Department of

biography and documents from his appearances at panels over the past decadeTrumpsmeeting with The Post was on the record An audio recording was sharedby the editorial board and a full transcript will be posted later MondayTrump was accompanied to the meeting which took place at The Posts new headquarters by his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and spokeswoman Hope HicksA US-based employee of a Russian real estate company took part in a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between a Russian lawyer and Donald Trump Jr bringing to eight the number of known participants at the session that has emerged as a key focus of the investigation of the Trump campaigns interactions with RussiansIke Kaveladze attended the meeting as a representative of Aras and Emin Agalarov the father-and-son Russian developers who hosted the Trump-owned Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013 according to Scott Balber an attorney for the Agalarovs who said he also represents KaveladzeBalber said Tuesday that he had received a phone call over the weekend from a representative of special counsel Robert S Mueller III asking whether Kaveladze would agree to be interviewed Balber said his client would cooperateThe request is the first public indication that Muellers team is investigating the meetingThe presence of Kaveladze at the Trump Tower meeting introduces a new and intriguing figure into the increasingly complex Trump-Russia drama A native of the Soviet republic of Georgia who came to the United States in 1991 Kaveladze was the subject nearly two decades ago of a congressional inquiry into Russian money laundering in US banks although he was never charged with a crime and Balber said there was never any sign of wrongdoing by KaveladzeThe emergence of new information on Tuesday  some 10days after the Trump Tower meeting was first reported  underscored how details of the session have been slow to emerge amid incomplete and potentially misleading explanations from Trump JrAfter the New York Times first reported the meeting Trump Jr said only that the lawyer had primarily discussed the adoption of Russian children by AmericansMore information about the meeting and its participants has emerged since July11 when Trump Jr said he wished to be transparent and released emails dating to June 2016 between himself and Rob Goldstone a music promoter who represented Emin Agalarov a Russian pop singer setting up the meeting  Those emails revealed that  on the promise that he would be provided damaging information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as part of a Russian government effort to help his fathers presidential campaign according to emails released by Trump Jr last weekTrump Jrs acknowledgment of the meeting undercut months of denials from top Trump aides that campaign officials had any contact with Russians before the November electionThe meeting brought together then-candidate Donald Trumps innermost circle including son-in-law Jared Kushner and top campaign adviser Paul Manafort as well as a Russian and Russian Americans with deep ties to Trumps business and the priorities of the Russian government Goldstone the music promoter told The Washington Post that he also attendedThe Russian lawyer  was leading an effort to get Congress to lift sanctions imposed in 2012 to punish Russia for human rights abuses a topic of deep importance to the Russian government Angered over the law called the Magnitsky Act Russia had put a hold on adoptions of children by US familiesAlso present at the meeting was Rinat Akhmetshin a Soviet army veteran whose military service in the 1980s came in a unit whose responsibilities included counterintelligence Now a Russian American lobbyist he has earned a reputation as a savvy political operator at times boosting the reputation of his clients by sullying the reputations of their enemies He has denied working for the Russian government or intelligence servicesKaveladze came to the meeting as a representative of the Agalarov family business associates of Donald Trump who were also a key tie between the Trump family and Russia in the years before Trump began his campaignTrump and Aras Agalarov had discussed building a Trump Tower in Moscow but plans fizzled after Western sanctions were imposed in 2014 and the Russian economy tanked the elder Agalarov told The Post last yearAlan Futerfas Trump Jrs attorney did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday about the presence of Kaveladze nor did a spokesman for Kushner An attorney for Manafort declined to commentKaveladze works as a vice president focusing on real estate and finance for the Agalarovs company the Crocus Group Balber saidBalber said that Aras Agalarov asked Kaveladze to attend on his behalf Kaveladze is a US citizen and has lived in this country for many years according to BalberBalber said Kaveladze believed he would act as a translator but arrived to discover that had brought her own translator a former State Department employee named Anatoli Samochornov Samochornov declined to comment citing a nondisclosure agreement he signed as a professional translatorBalber said that he thinks eight people attended the meeting and that the names of all the participants are now known to the public   Balber said Kaveladze recalls the meeting lasted about 30minutes and mostly involved discussion of the 2012 sanctions law In attending the meeting Kaveladze brought a history of controversyIn 2000 his actions as the head of a Delaware company called International Business Creations were the subject of a congressional investigation of how Russians and other foreigners were able to launder large amounts of money through US banksThe Government Accountability Office report which had been requested by then-Sen Carl Levin (D-Mich) concluded that it was relatively easy for these foreigners to use shell companies to open US bank accounts and route hidden money through the American financial systemThe report described the activities of IBCs president who Balber confirmed was KaveladzeBalber said Kaveladze was not charged with any crime as a result of the inquiry which he said was largely focused on the internal procedures of US banksThere has never been any indication that he did anything wrong Balber said From his perspective it was a big nothingBut Levin who at the time was the senior Democrat on a Senate investigations subcommittee and retired in 2014 issued a statement Tuesday calling Kaveladze a poster child of the practice of using shell companies to launder funds and that the inquiry helped spark reformsKaveladzes conduct helped us reinvigorate the requirement that banks know the true owner of their accounts a policy that hadnt been enforced over the years Levin saidBalber called Levins comments outrageous  the reality is that what my client did was unequivocally and undeniably legalAccording to the GAO Kaveladze opened 236 bank accounts in the United States for corporations formed in Delaware on behalf of mostly Russian brokers The GAO report said that Kaveladze had told officers of two US banks that he had conducted investigations of the Russian companies for which he opened accountsHe admitted to us that he made such representations to the banks but that he in fact had not investigated the companies the report said Balber objected to this part of the report saying I take issue with this adding that his client did not make such a statement to the GAOAll told the report traced the movement of $14billion in wire-transfer transactions deposited into 236 accounts opened at the two banks Citibank and Commercial BankWhat exactly was discussed at the 2016 Trump Tower meeting remains unclearAkhmetshin told The Post that Veselnitskaya spent a portion of the meeting describing a great campaign issue for the Trumps  allegations of Russian tax improprieties by a US venture capital firm whose executives were political donors Akhmetshin said that Veselnitskaya left behind a document with the Trump associates describing the allegations It was corporate stuff  lawyerly stuff Akhmetshin saidThe venture capital firm Ziff Brothers Investments had a financial stake in Hermitage Capital whose chief executive became the leading global advocate of the Magnitsky Act which was named for a former Hermitage auditor who died in a Russian jail under suspicious circumstancesA spokesman for Ziff Brothers Investments Michael Freitag declined to commentTrump Jr has said Veselnitskayas information was vague and made no sense and he decided the offer of damaging information about Democrats was a pretense to secure the meeting to discuss sanctions Julie Tate contributed to this reportThere have been twists and turnsover the past year  of President Trumps alleged ties to Russia and Russian influence on the 2016 presidential election to help Trump winYet one thing has remained consistent Trump blames the Democrats not the RussiansTrump says the latest reports of ties between his staff and Russians are the Democrats attempt to undermine his presidency But a look at his comments over the past year shows Trump used the same explanation for every new development in stories involving Russia the election and his staffIn this timeline we took a look at all the developments in the Trump-Russia controversy that Trump has blamed on Democrats We will update the timeline as necessaryJames R Clapper Jr then the director of national intelligencesaid his agency  of attempted cyberattacks on the campaigns He did not say whether the attempted attacks were successful whether foreign or domestic hackers were behind the attacks or which campaign networks were targeted DNC officials and  concluded that Russian government hackers breached the committees computer network gaining access to its database of opposition research on Trump and all email and chat traffic  Russia  A hacker identifying only as Guccifer 20  Yet that day Trump said the DNC hacked itselfWikiLeaks  from the DNC database Trump then the GOP presidential nominee  to obtainClintons private emails that had been deletedTrump later said he was joking He rejected allegations that Russians targeted DNC or that the Russians were attempting to help Trump get elected He blamed Democrats for fabricating Russian ties to Trump because they were embarrassed about WikiLeaks  even though the previous month he said the DNC hacked itselfFunny how the failing  is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said Trump is a genius America 1st Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump Crazy Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump)  As the GOP presidential nominee Trump began receiving intelligence briefings this month Trump reportedly was briefed on cybersecurity and the Russian governments attempts to interfere in the elections Over the next three months Trump repeatedly denied Russian involvement blamed the hacks on Democrats and praised WikiLeaks Trumps interview with Larry King  a state-funded Russian television network Trump said it was pretty unlikely that Russians were disrupting the elections which he deemed an inappropriate act In the Trump refused to blame RussiaUS intelligence agencies saying they were confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from US persons and institutions including from US political organizations In the  Trump again refused to blame Russia In the

over the Fake News Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) ()It took President Trump 12 days to speak publicly about a terrorist attack that left four American soldiers deadAnd even then it was only because a reporter asked Why havent we heard anything from you so far about the soldiers that were killed in NigerTrumps answer  that he likes to call and write letters to family members of slain service membersunlike his predecessors kicked off days of strange volleys between the president and the media Aides of former presidents quickly rejected the notion thattheir bosses did not communicate with families who had lost loved ones Reporters contacted Gold Star families and found that Trumps record of reaching out was at best spottyOn Tuesday RepFrederica S Wilson (D-Fla) said that Trumps call to the widow of Sgt La David T Johnson was so insensitive it left her in tearsBut beyond thatcontroversy theres a lot we still dont know about what happened in Niger and why four American soldiers died there Republicans and Democrats are calling for an investigation andWilson Mr Trumps BenghaziHeres what we do knowUS troops  to help the French military which was running an operation against al-Qaeda in Mali Then-President Barack Obama sent 150 service members to Nigers capital Niamey to set up a surveillance drone operation over Mali Today there are about 800 soldiers assisting in the fight against al-Qaeda the Islamic State and Boko Haram the Nigerian extremist militant group Many have been tasked with setting up a drone base in the countrys northern desert or running surveillance missions out of Niamey According to ABC News fewer than 100 Green Berets are in Niger to help build the capacity of its military Those troops can instruct their counterparts on skills from basic marksmanship to small-team maneuvering and calling in close air supportBut clearly the mission can turn dangerous and resemble something like combatIts unclear but we know that a group of eight to 12 USsoldierswas accompanying 30 to 40 Nigerien troops on some kind of mission near Tongo Tongo (Other accounts suggest that onlyeight to 12 Nigerien and American soldiers actually entered the village and that the other Nigerien troops were stationed nearby) The group met with leaders and collected supplies As they were heading home they were ambushed by about 50 militantsThere was a firefight  the assailantsblew up their vehiclesThesoldiers ran for cover and began returning fireApparently a French military aircraft was on the scene within 30 minutes but it didnt fire on the attackers (There are different accounts as towhy Reuters reported that the fighting was happening at close quarters so theFrench aircraft couldnt intervene Others have said that Niger forbids airstrikes on its soil)   based on military interviews with the survivors shared with the network by a US defense official some of the soldierssaid it seemed like the local leaders were delaying thesoldiers departure which caused them to suspect that the villagers may have been complicit in the ambushBut by the end of the fight four Americans were dead The remains of three  Staff Sgts Bryan Black Jeremiah Johnson and Dustin Wright were retrieved It took 48 hours to recoverthe body of Sgt La David Johnson who had been separated from the rest of the groupThere was also some initial disagreement about who flew the medevac helicopter to rescue the wounded and retrieve the deadThe Washington Post confirmed that contractorBerry Aviation conducted the casualty evacuation and transportAccording to the Pentagon the answer is yes Defense Department officials said that soldiers had carried out 29 similar operations in the past six months with no problems By this time they were considered routineBut critics wonder whether enough precautions were taken The troops were armed only with rifles and traveled in unarmored pickup trucks There was no US drone flying overhead to track the soldiers French officials told Reuters they felt the US military acted without enough intelligenceor contingency planningThe Defense Intelligence Agency has said it believes the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara was behind the attack The group has been around at least since 2015 when its leader split from al-Qaeda According to US officials this isnt an officially recognized branch of the Islamic State  oneAmerican official called it a wannabe In the past the group has attacked French counterterrorism forces but it hasnever before launched an attack on US forces ( Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen  from his home in Abalak Niger in 2016 Woodkey is still being held with five other hostages)The men were carrying small arms machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades The Pentagon said they were well-equipped and trained  Investigations are underway The Defense Department is conducting a review of what went wrong and the Pentagons Africa Command has sent a team of investigators to Niger (We need to collect some basic facts a Defense Department official ) The French military is also looking into it The Senate Armed Services Committee has called on the Trump administration to lay out a fuller explanation of what went wrongI think the administration has to be more clear about our role in Niger and our role in other areas in Africa and other parts of the globe Sen Jack Reed(D-RI) They have to connect it to a strategy They should do that I think that the inattention to this issue is not acceptableSen John McCain (R-Ariz) has been more blunt When asked by a reporter whether he thought the Trump administration was being upfront about what happened in Niger he replied simplyThe special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections  including whether President Trump obstructed justice when firing James B Comey as FBI director Nowwith every new development Trumps critics are quick to call for his impeachment and label his actions as obstruction of justiceYet this is not a simple process and many times such reactions are exaggerated Its still early in the investigation with no indication yet whether any findings could lead to potential chargesIts important to consider the full context and nuances in the face of heated rhetoric on this topic We explored some key questions below and provided links to other helpful expert analysesThis is one of those  termsthat are used frequently It generally refers to actions taken to impede an official investigation Obstruction of justice is a felony offenseThere are several federal statutes that include relevant language that could qualify someones actions as obstruction of justiceUnder  a person has committed a federal offense when they corruptly or by threats or force or by any threatening letter or communication influences obstructs or impedes or endeavors to influence obstruct or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States or the due and proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry or investigation in being had by either House or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the CongressThe key word here is corruptly that under federal statutes corruptly is defined as acting with an improper purpose personally or by influencing another including making a false or misleading statement or withholding concealing altering or destroying a document or other informationThis means that in obstruction of justice cases its not enough evidence to show someone intended to impede an investigation There needs to be evidence that the person impeded   that they knew it was wrong but did it anyway with corrupt intent Its about the mental state of the personThats a high bar and corrupt intent is not a black-and-white matter In the absence of conclusive findings by the special counsel there are many unanswered questions about whether what we know so far could build an obstruction of justice case Based on the facts available so far publicly there is not yet a case for obstruction of justice said Kenneth Starr the special counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton Obstruction of justice is really a very hard crime to make out Its not just you want the investigation to go away you suggest the investigation goes away Starr said Youve got to take really affirmative action  And you know what thats a good thing for all of us Crime should be difficult to proveFor more check out   by LawfareIn the 1974 case  the Supreme Court recognized that the president has constitutional authority to exercise executive privilege which protects compelled disclosure to other branches of governmentA recent example President Barack Obama invoked executive privilege when blocking Attorney General Eric Holder from releasing documents in Operation Fast and Furious As a result a in 2012 to hold Holder in contempt and a federal judge rejected Obamas privilegeExecutive privilege applies narrowly and it can only be used in certain circumstances such as protecting confidential or sensitive communications or matters of national security Basically the president canhave private frank conversations with his advisers to carry out his duty as president in an informed way This privilege doesnt apply tomatters of political expediencyThis continues to come up in news coverage as former and current federal officials are being called to testify in public hearings about matters they discussed with the president For example before Comeys June testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee there were questions as to whether Trump could invoke executive privilege to block Comey from testifying Of course at the time Comey was a private citizen after being fired from his job by Trump so Comey  even if Trump did assert this authorityReaders asked us to fact-check whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions correctly referenced executive privilege when refusing to answer certain questions about Comey and the Russia investigation during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in June The Justice Department cited Reagan-era memos about executive branch officials declining to answer questions at a congressional hearing about confidential conversations with the presidentBut as  legal experts were split on whether Sessions correctly followed protocol by refusing to answer questions in case Trump wanted to invoke privilegeTrumps critics are quick to jump to calls for impeachment but its a The Constitution lays the grounds for impeachment as treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors but high crimes and misdemeanors is not clearly defined Based on the legal and historical interpretation of the word high the word can be used to describe the position of the person holding high public office (ie president vice president federal judges)  not the severity of the crime or misdemeanorThe independent investigator or special counsel would complete the investigation and report the findings Then Congress would decide how to move forward and decide whether the findings amount to high crimes and misdemeanorsImpeachment starts in the House with a majority vote Think of the House as the body bringing charges or an indictment The Senate has power to try the impeachment and essentially convict or acquit the individual of the charges with a supermajorityIt is not the role of this Office [of Independent Counsel] to determine whether the Presidents actions warrant impeachment by the House and removal by the Senate those judgments are of course constitutionally entrusted to the legislative branch according to  of the Clinton investigationThe Starr report found 11 possible grounds for Clintons impeachment all having to do with Clintons false statements under oath about his sexual activities with Monica Lewinsky Clinton was accused of repeatedly lying under oath to a grand jury in his civil deposition and even to his own lawyer investigators found Clinton abused his constitutional authority by lying to the public and Congress throughout 1998 and tried to obstruct justice investigators foundIn December 1998 the House impeached Clinton accusing Clinton of perjury and of obstruction of justice Then in February 1999 the Senate acquitted Clinton of both charges Five Republicans and all 45 Democrats supported full acquittalAndrew Johnson was the only other president who was impeached amid his political fights with the Republican-controlled Congress over his Reconstruction-era policies The House brought 11 impeachment charges against Johnson in 1868 alleging him of high crimes and conspiracies but was narrowly acquitted by SenatePresident Richard M Nixon was threatened with impeachment but resigned during impeachment investigations()Republican Donald Trump gave a speech on June 22 attacking Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in back-to-back speeches by the two presumptive presidential nominees aimed at undermining eachothers credentialsA large portion of his speech criticized Clintons record as secretary of state and donations given to the Clinton Foundation as outlined in Peter Schweizers book Clinton Cash The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich One of the strongest charges Trump made was that Clinton ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund doing favors for oppressive regimes and many others and really many many others in exchange for cashBut Trump offered little evidence to back up this charge which doesnt make much sense beyond being an easy soundbite It ignores the fact that the actions of Clinton and Clinton Foundation have been heavily scrutinized over the years and thatcritics including Schweizer have not been able to prove quid pro quoWe fact-checked 25 claims from Trumps speech including many thathave been previously debunked (See our fact-check on Clintons June 21 speech )The quotes are in the order in which they were delivered As is our custom in such roundups we do not provide a Pinocchio ratingThe Fact Checker has run 10fact checks on Clintons often-misleading email statements Heres to a summary of the fact checksAs for Clintons Bosnia statement that she remembered landing under sniper fire made during the 2008 campaign The Fact Checker first exposed that including the video of the flower greeting Heres a link to Trump repeatedly makes this false statement  that he started his business empire with just a $1 million loan from his father But that is simply not credible as we documented Trump appears to have inherited about $40 million He also benefited from numerous loans and loan guarantees as well as his fathers connections to make the move into Manhattan His father set up lucrative trusts to provide steady income When Trump became overextended in the casino business his father bailed him out with a shady casino-chip loan  and Trump also borrowed $9 million against his future inheritance While Trump often asserts it has not been easy for me he glosses over the fact that his father paved the way for his success  and that his father bailed him out when he got into troubleThis figure is about right Bill and Hillary Clinton were personally paid $1583 millionfrom paid speeches between 2001 and 2015 according to Washington Post analysis of their financial disclosures However its unclear how many were given to lobbyists chief executives or foreign governments as the payment records do not reflect that level of detailTrump is right if he is referring to the  was a tariff act The founders of the new nation were eager that the United States develop its own manufacturing component and not become dependent on Great Britain for manufactured goods Interestingly the free traders at the time resided in the deep South where planters depended on selling raw materials (such as cotton) overseasWashington directed Alexander Hamilton as secretary of the Treasury to write a report on manufacturing Report on Manufactures which Hamilton delivered to Congress in December 1791 Washington was certainly interested in manufacturing though the chief figure encouraging protection of manufacturing was Hamilton said Julie Miller early America historian at the Library of CongressClinton did support her husbands embrace of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993 But its worth recalling the agreementwas   and approved by Congress with a majority of Republican votesMoreover the Congressional Research Service in 2015  the net overall effect of NAFTA on the US economy appears to have been relatively modest primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of US GDP Heres This was in reference to NAFTA which took effect in January 1994 and China joining the World Trade Organization in December 2001 The raw numbers check out there were 17 million manufacturing jobs in January 1994 16 million in December 2001 and 12 million as of March 2016 according to the Bureau of Labor StatisticsBut its more complex than that Not all these jobs were lost due to trade the manufacturing sector has declined as a source of jobs in the United States as productivity has risen The  it is difficult to measure the exact impact of trade compared to other variables that can affect the economy such as inflation and economic growthIt is bit silly to blame a secretary of state for a trade deficit which is mostly the result of decisions by businesses and consumers but lets check Trumps math anywayThe US trade deficit with China was $268 billion in 2008 and increased to $315 billion in 2012   the period that would cover Clintons four years as secretary of state Thats an increase of $47 billion or 175 percent So Trump overshoots the mark by more than double (Some readers suggested Trump was measuring from 2009 to 2013 That does show an increase of 40 percent in part because the Great Recession weakened trade in 2009 But thats the wrong window of time because it leaves off her first year as secretary of state and includes a year when she was not secretary)Clinton as secretary of state supported TPP negotiations but once the trade pact with 12 Asian rim nations was completed she announced she opposed it Any claims about either job gains or job losses from TPP  There are going to be winners and losers as in any trade deal but the overall impact will be more modest than either supporters or opponents claimsTrump overstates this claim a bit Clinton did remove a number of sections regarding TPP from the paperback version of her book Hard Choices supposedly for space reasons (The Center for Economic and Policy Research )But references to TPP can still be found on pages 69-70 such as One of our most important tools for engaging with Vietnam was a proposed new trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) which would link markets throughout Asia and the Americas lowering trade barriers while raising standards on labor the environment and intellectual propertyThere is no evidence to back up Trumps claim about the Benghazi attacks on Sept 11 2012 Clinton did leave the State Department before 11 pm at which point it was fairly clear that Stevens had perished By her own testimony before Congress Clinton did not go to sleep that night and was in constant contact with State I had other equipment that kept me in touch with the State Department at all times I did not sleep all night I was very much focused on what we were doingOur colleagues at FactCheckorg have  no requests from Stevens for additional security went directly to Clinton As for hundreds and hundreds of requests this is likely an exaggerated figure A figure of 600 circulated by the House Select Committee on Benghazi actually reflects requests and concerns and Democrats say fewer than 200 requests can be catalogued Moreover while some requests were not fulfilled others were acted on Trumps claims that all of the requests were ignored is wrongThis has been a frequent GOP attack line but the victims families have disagreed strongly about what Clinton told them in the aftermath of the attacks  and tracked down as many family members as possible Clinton says that in speaking with the families she did not blame the Benghazi attacks on the video Most participants we interviewed (four out of six) back up her version saying they do not recall her mentioning a videoClinton was a backer of intervention in Libya but so was Donald Trump  Trump said this in a video blog in February 2011Many experts would argue that Iran gained influence in the region when the United States under President George W Bush toppled the Iraqi regime headed by Saddam Hussein a key enemy of the Islamic state (Clinton as a senator voted to authorize an invasion) As for the international agreement on Irans nuclear program that is supposed to thwart Tehrans path to a weaponTrump has repeatedly and falsely claimed he was against the Iraq war  Instead there is far more evidence that he supported the invasion There is nothing in the public record that shows he opposed the war until more than a year after the war started  and the US occupation started to run into troubleThere is a book by a former Secret Service agent due to be released on June 28 that  But several former Secret Service agents including the president of the Association of Former Agents of the United States Secret Service  that the author was too low-ranking to have seen any of what he claimsTrump has repeatedly made this hundreds of thousands claim usually referring to Syria  The Obama administration said it would accept a total of 85000 refugees in 2016 and 100000 in 2017 Thats from all countries of which 10000 would be from Syria in 2016 (In September Clinton said she in 2017) In fiscal 2013 about 30 percent came from the Middle East mostly from Iraq So no matter how you calculate it it does not add up to hundreds of thousandsTrump also falsely claims there is no way to screen refugees The process actually takes two more years after vetting that starts with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and then continues with checks by US intelligence and security agenciesThis is a revised Trump talking point on migrants convicted of terrorist activity to include migrants and their children (We previously awarded him  for claiming that scores of recent migrants were charged with terrorism)Were not sure exactly where Trump is getting this information but heis still not accurateWe reviewed cases from 2014 and 2015 involving 76 people charged with activities relating to foreign terrorist organizations The majority of those cases involved naturalized US citizens andlawful permanent residentsThere were both naturalized and natural-born US citizens (including those of Caucasian African American or Hispanic descent) Many of the naturalized citizens had arrived in the country as children and therefore not recent immigrantsSince 9/11there have been 140 non-US born individuals and 151 US-born citizens charged with jihadist terrorism-related crime in the United Statesaccording to analysis by the Trump repeats aclaim fromClinton Cash in reference to a November 2011 speech that Bill Clinton gave to the Swedish telecom company Ericsson for $750000 Earlier that year Ericsson was named in an April 2011 State Department report for selling telecom equipment to oppressive regimes and the State Department was coming up with new sanctions for Iran Schweizer wrote When the Obama administration revealed its sanctions for Iran a week after Bill Clintons speech telecom was not on the listSchweizer notes that in April 2012 Obama signed an executive order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to Iran and Syria but did not cover Ericssons work in Iran Hillary Clintons spokesman  that the sanctions were imposed through executive action by Obama not by Clinton and that the April 2012 executive order was directed at the users of technology who sought to stifle dissidents as opposed to the equipment manufacturers like EricssonAn entire chapter is dedicated to  in Clinton Cash In the book Schweizer reveals ties between the Clinton Foundation and investors who stood to gain from a deal that required State Department approvalClintons aides said she did not intervene in the deal Trumps claim suggests the State Department had sole approval authority but the department is one of nine agencies in the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States to vet and sign off on all US transactions involving foreign governments As  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission also needed to approve and did approve the transferTop US officials may accept gifts on behalf of the US government in circumstances where not accepting the gift would cause embarrassment to the donor and to the US government Clinton accepted a gold sapphire and diamond necklace worth $58000 from Bruneis queen The government of Brunei  over the years to the Clinton FoundationBut  to be transferred to the National Archives or General Services AdministrationThe necklace was recorded in the Federal Register  to the General Services AdministrationClinton on the trade accord if elected presidentThe Clinton Foundation has acceptedmillions from countries like Saudi Arabia Kuwait Qatar and Oman despite their poor human rights record The Washington Post has covered foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation  and  foreign sources made up a third of those who gave the foundation more than $1 million over time The foundation said the donations went to fund the organizationsphilanthropic work around the worldAmnesty is a rhetorical term for granting undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship  which Clinton does support But Trump exaggerates on immigration enforcement  focusing immigration resources on detaining and deporting those who pose a threat to public safety[ Hacked emails released on Oct 7 showed Clinton apparently said in a paid closed-door speechto a Brazilian bank My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders through green energyThe Clinton campaign has refused to authenticate the hacked emails but campaign manager Robby Mook said in an Oct 9 CBS Face the Nation interview that Clinton was talking about integrating green energy between North and South America  If the question is Does Hillary Clinton support throwing open our borders Absolutely not And she is going to do everything she can to fight to protect the interests of workers in this country]This is questionable Theres not a definitive figure for the cost ofClintons plans for refugees but she has proposed  for immigrant integrationservices and creating a national office of immigrant affairsTheObama administration has requested roughly$22 billion for fiscal 2017 for refugee assistance as PolitiFact noted Clintons request would be higher asshe supports accepting more Syrian refugees than Obama PolitiFact rated Trumps claim  after estimating Clintons plan could cost around $3 billion or $4 billion While its not clear how Trump wants to rebuild inner cities but the backlog to repairsubstandard housing alone in American cities would cost at least $26 billionTrump loves to say this but that doesnt make it any truer than the last time it was fact checkedThe statistics dont lie  the United States isnt anywhere near the top among industrialized nationsIn 2014 according to  of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) revenue as a percentage of the gross domestic product  the broadest measure of the economy  was 26 percent for the United StatesOut of 34 countries that put the United States in the bottom third  and well below the OECD average of 344 percent()Ifthe special counsel independent investigation into Russia collusion was going to charge someone five months in it makes senseIn many ways Trumps former campaign chairman is squarely in the crosshairs of the Russia-Trump collusion investigation His brief tenure as the head of Trumps campaign happened as concerns about Russias meddling in the 2016 election were heating up hes got high-level connections to Russia in his own right and hes got a whole host of scrutinized financial dealings that could make him a useful tool forinvestigators seeking cooperationManafort and his former business partner Rick Gates have been ordered to turn themselves in on charges related to the investigation on Monday Heres why Manaforthas become such a likely target for the special counsel If Robert S Mueller IIIs team is investigating Trump-Russia connections it is not going to stop at some low-level Trump associate These investigators are going straight to the top to see if they find evidence of collusion and for several key months in 2016 Manafort was the top He likely has knowledge of the inner workings of the campaign said Jeffrey Jacobovitz a white collar lawyer who has represented members of the Clinton administration  When Donald Trump Jr was told the Russian government was trying to help his father win and oh by the way do you want to meet with a Russian lawyer who has dirt on Hillary Clinton Trump Jr didnt go alone He brought along Manafort and Jared Kushner Trumps son-in-lawIt appears Manafort took detailed notes of that meeting and those notes could be key evidence if there are any collusion-related chargesThat meetings circumstances are as close as you can get to a smoking gun onwhether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia Jacobovitz and other legal experts said at the time   A Russian aluminum magnate A pro-Russian former Ukrainian president A Republican congressman who advocates for close ties between the United States and Russia A business associate from his time in Ukraine who once served in the Russian army and had dinner with Manafort during the campaignOf all the Trump campaign officials Manafort has the most known connections to Russia Before he joined Trumps campaign he was a political consultant in Ukraine where he helped elect a president backed by Russia (That president was toppled four years later and fled to safety in Russia)  in June that Manaforts consulting firm received $17 million over two years from that presidents political party the Party of RegionsDuring the campaign the New York Times uncovered ledgers in Ukraine for secret under-the-table payments to the Party of Regions allies Manaforts name was in them though he denied any wrongdoing The news eventually led to Manaforts resignation from Trumps campaign three months after he got elevated to the top job Manaforts role in the Trump campaign isnt the only aspect of his life under federal investigation Hes also being investigated for money laundering a $35 million mortgage he took out on his home in the Hamptons and whether heviolated any laws by not fully disclosing his work as a foreign agent in UkraineThats significant leverage investigators have on Manafort Ifthey cant persuade Manafort to cooperate on the Russia investigation and the FBI raid then these charges are evidence they couldntthey could potentially force him to cooperate by threatening him with unrelated legal troubleThreateningsomeone with legal trouble is a common tactic to try to get them to cooperate with the broader investigationJacobovitz said Its possible the special counsel is using those same kinds of tools on Michael Flynn Trumps former national security adviser who is facing legal questions over his failure to disclose his lobbying work for Turkey Investigators have also zeroed in on Flynns sons work abroadIts a first step and it could be one of many Jacobovitz saidFor all these reasons Manafort is also the perfect target to send a message to the rest of WashingtonsaidJack Sharman a white-collar lawyer in Alabama and former special counsel for Congress during the Bill Clinton Whitewater investigation who talked to The Fix in August  unannounced before dawn And that message is the special counsel investigation means business and isnt afraid to target high level members of the Trump campaignNewly discovered emails found on a computer seized during an investigation of disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner thrust the controversy over Hillary Clintons use of a private server back into the presidential campaign less than two weeks before the electionOfficials said the discovery prompted a surprise announcement Friday by FBI Director James B Comey that the agency would once again be examining emails related to Clintons time as secretary of stateIn a letter to lawmakers Comey said the FBI would take appropriate investigative steps to determine whether the newly discovered emails contain classified information and to assess whether they are relevant to the Clinton server probeThe emails numbering more than 1000 were found on a computer used by both Weiner (D-NY) and his wife top Clinton aide Huma Abedin according to law enforcement officials with knowledge of the inquiry who spoke on the condition of anonymityThe correspondence included emails between Abedin and Clinton according to a law enforcement officialFederal officials have been examining sexually suggestive online messages that Weiner allegedly exchanged with a teenage girl The link to the Weiner investigation was first reported by the New York TimesComeys announcement appears to resume the FBIs probe of Clintons server which previously ended in July The announcement could reshape a presidential race that Clinton the Democratic nominee has been leading in most public polls It was immediately hailed by Republican nominee Donald Trump who told supporters at a New Hampshire rally that perhaps finally justice will be done The crowd responded with pumped fists and chants of Lock her up Lock her upClinton told reporters Friday night in Iowa that she learned of the newly discovered emails only after the letter to Congress was made publicIm confident whatever [the emails] are will not change the conclusion reached in July she said Therefore its imperative that the bureau explain this issue in question whatever it is without any delayAsked about the connection to Weiner Clinton said Weve heard these rumors We dont know what to believe   Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta called it extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election Officials familiar with the inquiry said it was too early to assess the significance of the newly discovered emails It is possible they said that some or all of the correspondence is duplicative of the emails that were already turned over and examined by the FBIComey made a similar point in his letter sent to congressional committee chairmen saying that the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significantThe letter which was three paragraphs long contained few detailsHe wrote that the FBI in connection with an unrelated case had recently learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the Clinton investigationComey wrote that he was briefed on the new material Thursday I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation he wrote  An FBI spokesman on Friday declined to elaborate and a spokesman for Attorney General Loretta E Lynch declined to commentComey provided no details about the unrelated case that resulted in the discovery of the new emailsThe official said that Comey once told about the find felt an obligation to inform Congress since he had previously told lawmakers that the investigation had been completedAbedin who has worked for Clinton since the 1990s is vice chairman of Clintons presidential campaign She exchanged thousands of emails with Clinton while serving as her deputy chief of staff at the State Department She like Clinton used an email address routed through the private serverNeither Weiner nor an attorney for Abedin responded to requests for commentWeiner who represented a New York City congressional district  from his House seat in 2011 after he accidentally tweeted an explicit photo of himself that he had intended to send to a supporterAbedin and Weiner were married in 2010 with former president Bill Clinton officiating Abedin announced this past August that she was  from Weiner following a report in the New York Post about another sexting incidentThe federal inquiry into Weiners contact with the teenager was sparked by a September  in the Daily Mail tabloidWhen Comey announced the FBIs findings in July he said that Clinton had been extremely careless in her handling of classified material which was found among the emails exchanged on her private serverHe said then that his investigators had found evidence of potential violation of laws governing the handling of classified informationBut he said no reasonable prosecutor would bring charges because investigators had not found evidence that there had been intentional mishandling of classified material or indications of disloyalty to the United States or efforts to obstruct justice  Comey had come under enormous pressure from Republicans for his recommendation to bring no case against Clinton Trump has repeatedly cited the decision as a sign of corruption endemic to Washington institutions and has promised that if elected he would reopen the investigationPodesta on Friday cited the political pressure on Comey in questioning the directors actions saying that Republicans had been browbeating career FBI officials to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clintons presidential campaignDemocrats said Friday that the lack of detail from the FBI allowed Republicans to mischaracterize its actions Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon told CNN that Comey was unleashing a wildfire of innuendoThe top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee SenDianne Feinstein (Calif) issued a blistering statement Friday expressing shock at the FBIs vague announcement which she said played right into the political campaign of Donald TrumpThe FBI has a history of extreme caution near Election Day so as not to influence the results she said Todays break from that tradition is appallingSome lawmakers saw the announcement as a potential game-changer for the electionA total bombshell said Rep Peter T King (R-NY) a member of the House Homeland Security Committee King predicted that the FBI would not close its inquiry before the election and said he believed that Comey wanted the public to know of his move regardless of the outcomeHe wants it all out there King saidBut there was confusion about the FBIs announcement and immediate calls from lawmakers in both parties for additional informationSen Charles E Grassley (R-Iowa) chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a frequent Clinton critic called the letter unsolicited and quite honestly surprisingCongress and the public deserve more context to properly assess what evidence the FBI has discovered and what it plans to do with it Grassley said  Clintons campaign has been bedeviled by the email controversy since before its formal launch in April 2015Hacked emails released in recent days by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks show that even some of her closest campaign aides were surprised by her use of the server and frustrated by her response including her slowness to apologizeDid you have any idea of the depth of this story Podesta asked campaign manager Robby Mook late on March 2 2015 the day the New York Times revealed that Clinton had exclusively used a private account as secretaryNope Mook replied early the next day We brought up the existence of emails in [research] this summer but were told that everything was taken care ofPolls show that the issue has hurt Clinton politically A Washington Post-ABC News poll last month found that more than 6 in 10 Americans did not approve of the way Clinton had been handling questions about her email setupThe State Departments deputy spokesman Mark Toner said the FBI has not notified the department of the new emails and he referred all questions to the bureauWe stand ready to cooperate if were asked to do so he told reporters But I dont have any additional details at this point Jenna Johnson Tom Hamburger Carol Morello Adam Entous and Ellen Nakashima contributed to this reportThe Obama administration is seeking to amend surveillance law to give the FBI explicit authority to access a persons Internet browser history and other electronic data without a warrant in terrorism and spy casesThe administration made  six years ago but dropped it after concerns were raised by privacy advocates and the tech industryFBI Director James B Comey has characterized the legislation as a fix to a typo in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act which he says has led some tech firms to refuse to provide data that Congress intended them to provide  But tech firms and privacy advocates say the bureau is seeking an expansion of surveillance powers that infringes on Americans privacyNow at the FBIs request some lawmakers are advancing legislation that would allow the bureau to obtain electronic communication transactional records using an administrative subpoena known as a national security letter An NSL can be issued by the special agent in charge of a bureau field office without a judges approvalSuch records may include a persons Internet protocol address and how much time a person spends on a given site But they dont include content such as the text of an e-mail or Google search queries Theres also a limit to how much visibility the bureau would have into which part of a website a person had visited For instance according to the bureau if the person went to any part of The Washington Posts website law enforcement would see only washingtonpostcom  nothing more specificComey said that making this change to the law is the bureaus top legislative priority this yearThe inability to obtain the data with an NSL affects our work in a very very big and practical way he told the Senate Intelligence Committee in FebruaryThe Senate panel recently voted out an authorization bill with the NSL amendment The Senate Judiciary Committee this week is considering a similar provision introduced by to ECPA a law governing domestic surveillanceCornyn said that what he characterized as a scriveners error in the law is needlessly hamstringing our counterintelligence and counterterrorism effortsBut privacy groups and tech firms are again warning that the expansion of power would erode civil-liberties protectionsThe fix the FBI seeks would dramatically expand the ability of the FBI to get sensitive information about users online activities without oversight said a coalition of privacy and civil society groups and industry organizations in a letter sent to the Hill MondayThe new categories of information that could be collected using an NSL would paint an incredibly intimate picture of a persons life said the letter signed by the American Civil Liberties Union Amnesty International USA the Computer & Communications Industry Association Google Facebook and Yahoo among others For example a persons browsing history location information and certain email data could reveal details about a persons political affiliation medical conditions religion and movements throughout the day they saidIn addition the NSL would come with a gag order preventing the company from disclosing it had a received a government request said Neema Singh Guliani ACLU legislative counsel The letter noted that over the past 10years the FBI has issued more than 300000 NSLs most of which had gag orders Thats the perfect storm of more information gathered less transparency and no accountability Gulani saidBut a law passed last year the USA Freedom Act requires the Justice Department to review gag orders periodically to assess whether they are still justifiedThe amendment being considered Thursday by the Judiciary Committee is part of a broader effort by lawmakers to update ECPA to require law enforcement to get a warrant for all email content regardless of whether it is one day or one year old Privacy groups and tech companies support the broader ECPA update versions of which some lawmakers have sought for yearsBut the groups and tech organizations in their letter said that if the ECPA bill includes the NSL provision they will pull their supportA November 2008 opinion from the Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel made clear that ECPA allows the FBI to obtain with an NSL only four types of basic subscriber information from Internet companies name address length of service and telephone bill records There is no reference in the law to browser history for instance The opinion said the four existing categories were exhaustiveThe FBIs Office of General Counsel however has argued that electronic communication transactional records are the functional equivalent of telephone billing records To eliminate any uncertainty the FBI wants the law to explicitly cover such dataSens Patrick J Leahy (D-Vt) the ranking minority-party member on the Judiciary Committee and Mike Lee (R-Utah) a committee member oppose the Cornyn amendment They say they will push for a clean version of the ECPA update similar to a bill passed by the House earlier this yearThe troops searching for Bowe Bergdahl were sleep-deprived and thirsty Temperatures in mountainous Ghazni near Afghanistans border with Pakistan crested 100 degrees Although it was unusual to be without ready resupply for more than a few days the inconceivable disappearance of a US soldier called for round-the-clock missions far from their logistical hubsAfter 10 days in the field their socks began to rot Protective gloves frayed They were dependent on Russian contractors to airdrop in more drinking water but the hasty resupply included none  only Gatorade muffins and hygiene products The soldiers vented their frustration by blowing up the pallets then continued their search for Bergdahls ghostThis episode described to The Washington Post by a former member of Bergdahls unit illustrates one of the Armys chief arguments for sending Bergdahl to prison By abandoning his post in June 2009 he set in motion a chain of events that proved distracting to the Afghanistan war effort and put at grave risk the thousands of people tasked with finding him  Bergdahl now 31 would spend five years in Taliban captivity before the Obama White House secured his release in a controversial prisoner exchange in 2014 He has pleaded guilty to charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy which carries a maximum sentence of life in prisonThe judge who will determine Bergdahls fate Army Col Jeffrey R Nance is set to hear on Wednesday from troops who say their serious injuries are linked to Bergdahls disappearance  testimony that could determine the severity of Bergdahls punishmentNance also is expected to rule on a motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that President Trump who has referred to Bergdahl as a dirty rotten traitor  to impartial proceedingsWednesdays testimony may include Army Sgt 1st Class Mark Allen who was shot in the head during a search mission and is confined to a wheelchair Senior Chief Petty Officer James Hatch a Navy SEAL also has said his career was ended after being shot in the leg during a hastily planned operation to locate Bergdahl He too may appear in courtNeither Allen nor Hatch would have been where they were doing what they were doing but for the actions of the accused Nance wrote in a July court filingThe defense has argued that Bergdahl cannot be held responsible for successive events stemming from his disappearance and abduction His lawyers have questioned how much blame Bergdahl shoulders for what occurred to others because of his actionsMore clear is how the expansive search effort affected the war in eastern Afghanistan at the time Counterinsurgency operations were halted along with preparations for a national election to shift all available resources to finding BergdahlThe former member of Bergdahls unit who described the botched resupply mission said a surge in related nighttime raids upset many Afghans at a time US forces needed their support to help counter the Talibans influence It angered most soldiers too he told The Post on the condition of anonymity to avoid conflicts with his current employer The militarys sacred mantra of leave no man behind was challenged by the extraordinary event of a soldier leaving his post voluntarily he saidResources flooded into Afghanistans Paktika province such as surveillance drones helicopter support and equipment used to intercept phone and radio traffic But that came at a cost to units outside the search area forced to fight with fewer advantages the former soldier saidIn one instance five days after Bergdahls disappearance a US combat outpost was nearly overrun by hundreds of Taliban fighters resulting in the death of two US soldiers Those soldiers were surprised by their attackers they would later say because they lacked drones and other intelligence assets that had been diverted to find Bergdahl the former soldier recalledBoth the prosecution and defense have the opportunity to present arguments that could influence the judges decision There is little doubt the prosecution will focus on how the war was affected by search efforts said Brian Bouffard a former Navy lawyer The defense meanwhile might zero in on reports such as one in  that said search missions in Afghanistan continued even after the Pentagon was confident Bergdahl was being held in PakistanIf anyone is wounded on a futile mission there is a lot of blame to go around there Bouffard said And I dont think you can lay that on BergdahlBut many who served with Bergdahl blame him for tragedies that befell other members of their unit and frustration has lingered among those who feel their combat tour  and everything since  remains defined by Bergdahls disappearance the former soldier saidIts like he added the deployment that never endsCarter Page who served briefly as a foreign policy adviser to Donald Trumps presidential campaign made an appearance in a federal espionage case because he communicated several years ago with a Russian intelligence agent under surveillance by the FBIIn a statement released Tuesday Page confirmed his role in the 2015 Justice Department spy case adding another twist to the still-unfolding story of Trumps peculiar and expanding  connected to RussiaPage said he assisted US prosecutors in their case against Evgeny Buryakov an undercover Kremlin agent then posing as a bank executive in New York Buryakov was convicted of espionage and released from federal prison last week a few months short of completing a 30-month sentence Buryakov agreed to be immediately deported to RussiaPages involvement was first disclosed Monday by BuzzFeed which said Page was identified as Male1 in the Justice Departments complaint against a Russian spy network based in New YorkIn a written exchange with The Washington Post Page confirmed playing a role in the case but declined to discuss detailsGiven the very light masking in the original document from January 2015 you can draw your own conclusions Page wroteAccording to the court records the FBI interviewed Page as part of the case against three Russian men identified as agents of the Russian overseas intelligence agency the SVR One of them Buryakov was operating undercover as an executive in the New York office of a Russian development bank  The case resurfaced in news accounts last week when President Trumps adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner acknowledged he had met with the head of the same bank in DecemberThe complaint includes transcripts from 2013 of wiretapped conversations among the Russians discussing their efforts to recruit Male1 identified as a New York energy trader whom the Russians described as willing to talkIn his statement Page compared the revelation of his role to the politically-motivated unmasking standards seen in the Obama Administration which have recently been exposedHe said the information was released as retribution for my public positions of dissent against Obama administration policy toward Russia The information about his role in the case amplified the reputational damage against me that has occurred through 2016 Page said After he was named by Trump as a foreign policy adviser news reports discussed his travel to Russia and his frequent criticism of US policy toward Russia under ObamaAccording to the 2015 complaint filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York Page met with a Russian agent Victor Podobnyy in January 2013 at an energy conference in New York It says that from January to June of that year Page as Male1 provided documents to [Podobnyy] about the energy business At the time the Russians were seeking information on US sanctions and on energy developmentAlthough Page communicated with the Russian agents in 2013 he said the information he provided was innocuousAs I explained to federal authorities prior to the January 2015 filing of this case I shared basic immaterial information and publicly available research documents with the spy who was serving then as a junior attache at the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United NationsIn doing so I provided him nothing more than a few samples from the far more detailed lectures I was preparing at the time for the students in my Spring 2013 semester Energy and the World Politics Markets and Technology course which I taught on Saturdays at New York UniversityDuring an interview with The Washington Post editorial page staff in March 2016 Trump identified Page once a Merrill Lynch investment banker in Moscow as a foreign policy adviser to his campaignBut in January after Pages name came up in news reports about Trump administration ties to Russia Trump press secretary Sean Spicer declared that Carter Page is an individual the president-elect does not knowPage a longtime energy executive is a US Naval Academy graduate who rose through the ranks at Merrill Lynch before founding his current firm Global Energy Capital He previously was a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations where he focused on the Caspian Sea region and economic development in former Soviet states He is also a fellow at the Center for National Policy in Washington and has a PhD from the University of LondonHe made  in July that included some criticism of US policyThe White House has energetically rejected the idea that Trump or his allies coordinated with Russia during the election The president has said investigators and the public should focus instead on leaks of information and reports that he and his advisers were improperly surveilled by the Obama administrationThe real story turns out to be SURVEILLANCE and LEAKING Find the leakers Trump tweeted Monday morningPage has said repeatedly in recent weeks that he would like to tell his story to congressional investigators looking at Russian government efforts to influence the course of the 2016 election and the leak of information about that effortI very much look forward to providing further evidence regarding last years historic crimes committed against me and all Americans Page saidRepublican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie on Monday launched a TV ad claiming that Democrat Ralph Northam made it easier for violent felons and sex offenders to get their hands on gunsThe ad is based on outgoing Gov Terry McAuliffes sweeping actions to restore voting and other civil rights to felons In one of the few states that permanently disenfranchises felons McAuliffe (D) has restored the right to vote and to serve on juries to more than 168000 felons who have completed their sentences His action also helped them over the first hurdle to have their gun rights restored although the felons still need judges to sign offLast year Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam instituted the automatic restoration of rights for violent felons and sex offenders making it easier for them to obtain firearms and allowing them to serve on juries the ad begins One of these felons John Bowen had his rights restored two months after being found with one of the largest child pornography collections in Virginias historyBowen of Accomack County was convicted of aggravated sexual battery and indecent liberties with a minor in 2001 and served a one-year sentence reported Like other felons who had completed their sentences he had his rights restored under McAuliffe Bowen lost his voting rights again in January when he pleaded guilty to a new felony possession of child pornography He is serving 15 years in prison the paper reported in JuneMcAuliffe (D) on Monday tore into Gillespie for what he saw as an attack on one of his signature achievements in office  one that Northam as a member of McAuliffes administration has called one of our greatest featsIts based on the same fears and same division we saw from Donald Trump McAuliffe said during a conference call with news media that was hastily arranged to respond to the ad This is a page right out of Donald Trumps playbook  Hes gone into the gutter one more time This is one of the most divisive campaigns I have ever seenIf you look at the ad and the individual he uses in the ad obviously he is trying to sensationalize the issue McAuliffe said Ed is trying to divide people and scare people as he has done this whole campaignThe Northam campaign attacked Gillespie for running one of the most virulently negative and ugly campaigns in recent memorySince he has no positive ideas hes resorted to lying about Dr Northam Northam spokesman David Turner said It is a new low for him to accuse a pediatrician and childrens hospice medical director of favoring felons who have hurt children Ralph believes all Virginians who have served their time and are law-abiding should have their rights restored and thats never changed Ed knows that and should be ashamedComing two weeks before Election Day the ad doubles down on the law-and-order theme that Gillespies campaign thinks will play well with suburban swing voters as well as conservatives who voted for Trump last year For weeks Gillespie has aired ads that seek to blame Northam for the rise of the MS-13 street gang Critics including former president Barack Obama at a Northam rally in Richmond last week have called the ad an attempt at fearmongeringWhat hes really trying to deliver is fear Obama said  Most public polls indicate that the race will be tight Political observers are watching the contest  the only competitive governors race in the nation this year  as a referendum on Trump and a hint of what could come in next yearss congressional midterms  Virginia is one of a handful of states that permanently disenfranchises felons The Virginia Constitution however gives the governor authority to restore the right to vote serve on a jury and run for public officeMcAuliffes predecessor Robert F McDonnell (R) simplified and accelerated that process but McAuliffe took it to a new level With great fanfare on the steps of the state Capitol in April 2016 McAuliffe announced that he had restored rights to 206000 He heralded his action as a way for Virginia to move past the Jim Crow era noting that African Americans have been disproportionately affected by felon disenfranchisement  A year later McAuliffe said he had restored more voting rights than any other US governor calling it his proudest achievement in office But it has been a bumpy road to the record booksMcAuliffe had intended his original executive order to cover only felons who had served their time and completed parole but he mistakenly restored rights to 132 sex offenders still in custody as well as to several convicted killers on probation in other statesRepublican legislators furious because the order included violent felons and those who had not paid court costs or made restitution to their victims filed a lawsuit with the state Supreme Court The GOP won with the court ruling that the governor had exceeded his clemency powers because he restored rights en masse instead of individuallySince then the governor has used a fast but individualized approach to restore rights to 156000 felons  a process that passed muster with the high courtVirginia Republican Ed Gillespie has released four ads that try to tie his Democratic rival for governor Ralph Northam to MS-13 gang violence despite protests from Democrats and Latino groups that the commercials play on racial stereotypesThe latest ad which started airing this week in the Roanoke market begins with a dark hooded figure in a home holding up a baseball bat as the MS-13 motto Kill Rape Control flashes on the screen Then a narrator warns of violent crime linked to the street gang in Virginia  and accuses Northam of putting Virginia families at riskNortham cast the deciding vote in favor of sanctuary cities that let illegal immigrants who commit crimes back on the street increasing the threat of MS-13 the narrator says  a claim that the nonpartisan FactCheckorg calls misleading  The new ad echoes a  aired last week by the Gillespie campaign that interspersed images of Northam with the MS-13 motto and tattooed faces of men who as it turns out were not MS-13 members and were photographed in a prison in El SalvadorThat commercial which launched in the television markets serving Charlottesville and Southside and southwestern Virginia has expanded to urban areas including Richmond and the DC market that includes Northern VirginiaThe MS-13 ads mark a shift in the tone of the Virginia governors race which is the nations marquee statewide contest this year and had been applauded by observers for its relative civilityBob Holsworth a former Virginia Commonwealth University political scientist said the ads seem intended to grab the attention of voters and give them a compelling reason to go to the pollsThis is going back to an old-line Republican message that Democrats policies are making the streets less safe he said Whether its something thats going to motivate voters  the polls dont seem to show that public safety is a critical issue in this race But I think theres some belief in the Gillespie campaign that in a low-turnout election this can motivate voters  The ads sparked a firestorm of criticism from Democrats who accused Gillespie of playing on fears of Latinos They likened the commercial to the  used against Democrat Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential race that focused on an African American felon who committed crimes while out on a weekend furlough program in Massachusetts The commercial was damaging to Dukakis the governor of Massachusetts at the time of Hortons release Critics said the ad preyed on public fears of black criminalsGillespies commercials have attracted national notice Fox News host Tucker Carlson on one of the ads this week sparring with Latino Victory Fund President Cristbal J AlexCarlson said that members of MS-13 are often undocumented immigrants and that sanctuary cities offer them shelter Alex said the ad falsely equates undocumented immigrants with gang members and is part of a broader Republican effort to turn MS-13 into a Latino boogeymanBen Marchi a longtime Republican operative from Culpeper said the strategy is a smart attempt to attract suburban swing voters especially in places such as Prince William and Loudoun counties where gang violence is a problemIts a great ad he said of the first spot That is the message that Virginians do care about They want to know theyre safe and right now theres a problem with violent illegal aliensWhile Gillespies campaign normally rolls out new commercials with news releases and social media blasts it did not take similar steps for the MS-13 commercialsGillespie declined to comment about the ads after his appearance Thursday at a Richmond forum directing questions to spokesman David AbramsAbrams said via text As extensively reported by The Washington Post MS-13 is a growing problem in Virginia Allowing for the establishment of sanctuary cities in Virginia as  Northam has voted for will not help us solve the problem or make us safer Ed opposes sanctuary cities and he has put forward a substantive detailed plan to keep Virginians safeNortham appearing at the same forum called the ad unfortunateMy father was a judge My grandfather was a judge he said noting that the Virginia Sheriffs Association applauded him as legislator of the year in 2011 For someone to say that Im soft on crime or want to release convicted felons thats shortsightedNortham has said that anyone who commits a violent crime should be prosecuted regardless of immigration status  Virginia is among the states that have seen a resurgence of MS-13 activity driven in part by the recent influx of unaccompanied teenage immigrants according to a  cited in Gillespies campaign commercialsAuthorities say MS-13 is behind the recent deaths of a in Springfield a 21-year-old man in Dumfries and a 25-year-old man outside a bar in  among othersNortham the states lieutenant governor did cast a tiebreaking vote in February against a GOP bill that would have banned sanctuary cities localities that choose not to cooperate with federal immigration authoritiesBut the bill ultimately passed the state Senate so Northam did not cast the deciding vote It was later vetoed by Gov Terry McAuliffe (D)Meanwhile Virginia has no such localities a fact that Gillespie has acknowledged but that is omitted from his adsVirginia voters will choose a new governor on Nov7As Moscow lashed out Thursday at Ukraines new leaders and the Western nations it believes to be backing them ousted president Viktor Yanukovych resurfaced in Russia and claimed he is still Ukraines legitimate head of stateYanukovych now apparently under Russias protection hadnt been heard from since he fled Kiev on Saturday He argued in a statement distributed Thursday that his opponents had reneged on a  they had signed with him last Friday The Russian government which had refused to endorse the deal at the time now says it agrees with him and wants the There is little chance of that happening and Moscow knows itBut it gives the government of President Vladimir Putin a justification for its refusal to have any dealings with the new authorities in Kiev which is under immense strain from pro-Russia protests on the Crimean Peninsula  coffers left empty by Yanukovych and uncertain control of the countryThe new leaders are also facing a major Russian military exercise on their doorstep And they must contend with militant groups on the Maidan  the protest site in Kiev that is also known as Independence Square  who see them as being too likely to betray the uprisingOn his first day on the job the interim prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said he and his cabinet ministers were going to have to take a kamikaze approach  immediate and very painful steps  to stem a financial meltdownThey have also applied for help from the European Union and the International Monetary FundPensions have not been paid in full for more than a month Yatsenyuk told the Ukrainian parliament called the Verkhovna Rada The foreign currency and gold reserves have been ransacked And we are doing everything we can today to stop the situation from deteriorating furtherYanukovych had secured a $15billion bailout from Russia late last year in exchange for turning his back on the European Union but Russia has since suspended the program after committing  and now writing off  $3 billionUkraines new government said Thursday that Yanukovych and his allies had spirited $70billion out of the country illegally since his election to the presidency in 2010Under the terms of last weeks short-lived deal brokered by Poland Germany and France Yanukovych was to have remained in power until new presidential elections could be held in December And a national unity government was to be formed with members from all the major partiesBut Yanukovych absconded hours later and the parliament voted shortly afterward to remove him from office He has since been charged with mass murder in connection with the deaths of nearly 90 people during the protests The government installed Thursday draws only from what had been the opposition parties  and this is a factor that Moscow especially objects to The obligation to set up a national unity government sank into oblivion the Russian Foreign Ministry said on its Web site Instead as was announced in Maidan a government of winners has been set up that includes representatives of nationalist extremistsYanukovychs Party of Regions which is now the opposition has repudiated him But he said in his statement Thursday that this was done under duressI officially declare my determination to fight until the end for the implementation of the important compromise agreements concerning the Ukrainian recovery from the profound political crisis Yanukovych saidUkraine has put him on an international wanted list and hopes to send him to the International Criminal Court at The Hague for a trial A new vice prime minister Vitaly Yarema told the news service RBC-Ukraine that the government would seek Yanukovychs extradition from RussiaHe is no longer president he is a wanted person who is suspected of mass murder a crime against humanity Yatsenyuk said Russia will almost certainly not send Yanukovych back to Kiev as long as it considers the new government there to be illegitimate But that doesnt mean that Moscow wants to return him to power said Dmitri Trenin of the Carnegie Moscow CenterThe Kremlin has given up on him Trenin said He is not worthy of being seen as a serious player in UkraineA Russian newspaper and a Ukrainian Web site reported that Yanukovych had been spotted Tuesday evening in Moscow  at the aptly named Ukraine HotelRussian news agencies reported that Yanukovych plans to hold a news conference Friday afternoon in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don about 40 miles from the Ukrainian border as the crow flies and close to his home base of DonetskInterfax and Itar-Tass both reported that the Moscow government has provided Yanukovych with a security guarantee as long as he is on Russian soil However there has been no indication whether this pledge of protection could lead to permanent asylum A Russian lawyer told the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper that if Yanukovych were formally accused of murder Russia should extradite himBased on the norms of international law and signed mutual treaties Alexander Treshev said Russia would have to do itIgnoring such obligations would damage Russias image he said William J Burns US deputy secretary of state was in Kiev on Wednesday and Thursday conferring with political leaders and discussing financial helpThe United States stands with the Ukrainian people at this remarkable moment he said according to the State Department Web site and we will do all we can to help them build the strong sovereign and democratic country they so richly deserveSuch comments have drawn criticism from Moscow which believes the United States and other Western nations have inappropriately chosen sides in UkraineRussia urges West to realize responsibility for Ukraines failed peace deal the Foreign Ministry tweeted Thursday Russia advises everyone to give up provocative statements on UkraineThursday was the first full day of large military preparedness drills in western Russia which will involve 150000 troops Russia has notified NATO that the exercises are not related to UkraineNevertheless Trenin said they show that Russia is prepared to defend its interests in this part of the world Kathy Lally in Moscow contributed to this reportHackers thought to be working for the Russian government breached the unclassified White House computer networks in recent weeks sources said resulting in temporary disruptions to some services while cybersecurity teams worked to contain the intrusion White House officials speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation said that the intruders did not damage any of the systems and that to date there is no evidence the classified network was hacked In the course of assessing recent threats we identified activity of concern on the unclassified Executive Office of the President network said one White House official We took immediate measures to evaluate and mitigate the activity  Unfortunately some of that resulted in the disruption of regular services to users But people were on it and are dealing with itThe FBI Secret Service and National Security Agency are all involved in the investigation White House officials are not commenting on who was behind the intrusion or how much data if any was takenCertainly a variety of actors find our networks to be attractive targets and seek access to sensitive information the White House official said We are still assessing the activity of concernUS officials were alerted to the breach by an ally sources said have identified cyber-espionage campaigns by Russian hackers thought to be working for the government Targets have included NATO the Ukrainian government and US defense contractors Russia is regarded by US officials as being in the top tier of states with cyber-capabilitiesIn the case of the White House the nature of the target is consistent with a state-sponsored campaign sources saidThe breach was discovered two to three weeks ago sources said Some staffers were asked to change their passwords Intranet or VPN access was shut off for awhile but the email system apart from some minor delays was never down sources saidWhite House officials said that such an intrusion was not unexpected On a regular basis there are bad actors out there who are attempting to achieve intrusions into our system said a second White House official This is a constant battle for the government and our sensitive government computer systems so its always a concern for us that individuals are trying to compromise systems and get access to our networksThe Russian intelligence service was believed to have been behind a breach of the US militarys classified networks which was discovered in 2008 The operation to contain the intrusion and clean up the computers  took monthsThat incident helped galvanize the effort to create US Cyber Command a military organization dedicated to defending the countrys critical computer systems  including those in the private sector  against foreign cyberattack as well as helping combatant commanders in operations against adversaries The command is expected to have some 6000 personnel by 2016 officials saidWhen directed by the president or

during the 2016 presidential election with the aim of undermining faith in the US democratic process and hurting Hillary Clintons electabilityHeres a guide to the talking points drawn from statements made by incoming White House chief of staff Reince Preibus on CBSs Face the Nation on Jan 8This echoes a claim that Trump made in a statement after the report was released  that there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the electionIntelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results Voting machines not touched Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) But this is clever sleight of hand designed to obscure the point of the reportThe intelligence report provided an accounting of Russian behavior during the election the intelligence agencies were not tasked to assess whether Russian actions swayed the election The report makes this clearWe did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcomes of the 2016 election The US Intelligence Community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions capabilities and actions of foreign actors it does not analyze US political processes or US public opinionDirector of National Intelligence James R Clapper Jr emphasized this when he testified  on Jan 5 Political analysis certainly isnt the purview of the US intelligence community he saidIn other words Trump officials are asserting a conclusion that does not exist in the report  because agencies were not asked to make such a conclusion Because the report is silent on the question of whether the election was swayed Trump officials falsely state there is no evidence that the Russian efforts succeededGiven Trumps narrow election victory  just a switch of 40000 votes in three states would have altered the outcome  analysts can point to any number of factors Clintons email controversy  and the FBI investigation that resulted  was certainly a major drag on her electoral prospects But at the same time during the campaign Trump repeatedly seized on revelations made by WikiLeaks (which US intelligence says came via Russia) to attack ClintonThe answer will never be known but it is not a question that US intelligence was asked to exploreThis is an example of attacking one of the victims the Democratic National Committee But it ignores the broader implications of the intelligence report  how the Russian government used Internet trolls and RT (Russias state-owned international news channel) to amplify negative reports on Clinton and US democracyThe Internet trolls started to advocate for Trump as early as December 2015 well before the WikiLeaks revelations began to be released on the eve of the Democratic National ConventionMeanwhile RTs coverage of Secretary Clinton throughout the presidential campaign was consistently negative and focused on her leaked e-mails and accused her of corruption poor physical and mental health and ties to Islamic extremism the report said (It does not mention that these attack lines mirrored attacks made by the Trump campaign)Again Preibus pins the blame on the DNC But there was a miscommunication between the DNC and the FBIAn FBI special agent tried to contact the DNC in September 2015 but he was transferred to a tech-support contractor on the help desk But after an initial conversation  indicating that the FBI had information there was at least one compromised computer on the DNCsnetwork  the contractor did not return repeated phone calls thinking he had been the subject of a prank call FBI officials did not press the issue at higher levels and the urgency of the issue did not become apparent until months laterJulian Assange who runs WikiLeaks told Fox News that Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in response to a phishing email for his Gmail account gave out his password as password As our colleagues at PunditFact  thats falseFirst of all Google does not allow users to use the word password as a password So Assange is wrongSecond emails leaked by WikiLeaks indicate that Podestas Windows 8 login was p@ssword Perhaps that is why Preibus was careful to use the word system although from the context of his remarks he seemed to be referring to Podestas Gmail account  because that was what the Russians are said to have hacked Just before he mentioned Podestas email he asserted that the reason this particular hack was so large wasnt necessarily because the effort was so great by the Russians It was that it was so easyBut Podestas Gmail accountwas hacked not his Windows 8 computer Podesta was Clintons campaign chairman and was not associated with the DNCFinally Trump officials like to point to President Obamas actions  or inactions  after officials accused China of accessing the Office of Personnel Management and obtaining information on 22 million Americans They argue that because Obama sanctioned Russia but not China hes trying to score political points and undercut Trumps victoryThey may have a point but the two situations are not directly comparable The Russian campaign as described by US intelligence involved more than just hacking with the aim of disrupting and possibly influencing the political process The Chinese hack hada more isolated goal  espionage China appears to have wanted the material in order to engage in possible blackmailUS officials also say that China responded to US pressure after the hack was discovered and there are signs its espionage activities have been reduced Timing is often importantin diplomacy China may have been receptive to US pressure at the time because President Xi Jinpingwas about to visit the United States and he did not want the hack to mar the visit China even  it had arrested the alleged hackers (Obama  that could have been used to issue sanctions against China for the attack)In any case Obama administration officials say the China case is different because it was purely a case of spying  something the United States does as wellWe did not retaliate against an act of espionage any more than other countries necessarily retaliate against us for when we conduct espionage Clapper told lawmakers People who live in glass houses need to think about throwing rocks Because this was an act of espionage and you know we and other nations conduct similar acts of espionage So if were going to punish each other for acts of espionage thats a different policy issueWhen the United States  a Russian spy ring in 2010 discovering agents who had embedded themselves in US society the spies were arrested and eventually became part of a spy swap between the two countries No sanctions were imposed  though that was also during the period when Obama was trying to reset relations with Russia()FBI investigators have a simple reason forJared Kushner can help them determine whether President Trumps campaign helped Russia influence the presidential election Kushner met with senior Russians during the campaignAnd while its not weird for presidential campaigns to meet with foreign officials under this context it wasRight around the time Trumps son-in-law and top adviser held a meeting with the Russian ambassador to the United States last spring the CIA director started to notice something weird The Russians were talking about actively aggressively trying to influence the US presidential election against Hillary ClintonJohn Brennan who was CIA director at the time then started to notice that the Russians were reaching out to Trump campaign officials His radar went off Heres what he told Congress in a hearing about Russian meddling on Tuesday Its worth reading the whole paragraph but Ive bolded some key pointsHaving been involved in many counterintelligence cases in the past  And so therefore by the time I left office on January 20 I had unresolved questions in my mind as to whether or not the Russians had been successful in getting US persons involved in the campaign or not to work on their behalf again either in a witting or unwitting fashion And so therefore I felt as though the FBI investigation was certainly well-founded and needed to look into those issuesIn other words When the Russians want to spy or meddle in other nations affairs their go-to move is to find people from that nation to cuddle up with or to blackmail if it gets to that (Suborn sits right in the middle of those two It means to bribe or secretly convince someone to do something) Lookups for suborn are up more than 28000% Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) When the director of the CIA realized that the Russians wanted to influence the US election he knew to keep an eye out for Russians reaching out to people tied to the election And sure enough Brennan said Russian officials started holding meetings with members of the Trump campaignMichael Flynn Kushner Now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions They all met with Russian officials at some point and  and the respectivelyhave reported that Sessions and Kushner did not disclose their meetings with Russians on their security-clearance forms A security clearance is required before a person can be privy to the nations top secrets Other members of Trumps campaign already had deep ties to Russia among them former campaign manager Paul Manafort and adviser   And its fair to say that US investigators would have been very intrigued to see then-candidate Trumps son-in-law one of his closest advisers receiving meetings with Russians This is a member of Trumps inner circle as close as you can get without meeting with the candidate himself Not to mention that Kushner  Going back to April 2016 we know Kushner met at least twice with the Russian ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak and a Moscow bankerThats not to say meeting with the Russians equates to colluding with the RussiansBrennan emphasized to theHouse Intelligence Committee These are contacts that might have been totally totally innocent and benign as well as those that might have succumbed somehow to those Russian effortsMany times they know that individuals may be Russian officials he said later speaking broadly about how Russians use people but they dont know that there is an intelligence connection or an intelligence motive behind itBrennan made clear that he had only suspected that Russians may have used or tried to use members of the Trump campaign to influence the electionBut and this is a really key but his suspicions were enough to refer everything he knew to the FBIThe FBI we know now took Brennans concerns seriously The agency is waist-deep in a months-long mostly covert investigation of Russia meddling and whether the Trump campaign helped And its investigation has led it to the highest ranks of the White HouseExactly what investigators want to know from Kushner (whose lawyer said he will cooperate) isnt clear But why their investigation has led them to Kushneris clearerGiven what we know about how the Russians try to use people it makes sense that Kushner who had several meetings with high-level Russians and is one of the presidents closest advisers is part of this investigationThomas J Barrack Jr a billionaire who is one of President Trumps oldest friends had spent weeks trying to smooth the way for a May presidential meeting in Saudi Arabia with Arab leaders of the Persian Gulf All initially went well Trump praised Qatar  where Barrack who is Arab American has deep business ties  as a crucial strategic partner Then Trump reversed course a few weeks later and attacked Qatar as a funder of terrorism at a very high level Barrack was taken aback that the president was intervening in a regional dispute So he did what few others in Trumps orbit have done He told the president in effect that he was wrongYou dont need to get involved Barrack said he told Trump The president heeded his friends advice met with the emir of Qatar and in September offered to mediateFew people are closer to Trump than Barrack his friend for three decades Barrack helped rescue Trumps real estate empire years ago He was the top fundraiser for Trumps 2016 presidential campaign He turned down a Cabinet offer preferring to be an outside adviser although his name is still mentioned as a potential White House chief of staff should Trump decide to choose a new one Above all Barrack has remained unfailingly loyal to Trump whom he sees as a shrewd politicianBut even as he remained a close friend and frequent confidant Barrack has also been disappointed by aspects of Trumps performanceBarrack in interviews with The Washington Post said he has been shocked and stunned by some of the presidents rhetoric and inflammatory tweets He disagrees with some of Trumps proposals including his efforts to ban immigrants from certain Muslim countries and his push for a border wall with Mexico He wonders why his longtime friend spends so much of his time appealing to the fringes of American politicsHe thinks he has to be loyal to his base Barrack said I keep on saying But who is your base You dont have a natural base Your base now is the world and America so you have all these constituencies show them who you really are In my opinion hes better than thisI tell him all the time I dont like the rhetoric Barrack who runs a large real estate investment company said at his Manhattan office Trumps relationship with Barrack is one of the most important if little understood of the presidents life offering a case study of what it takes to remain close to him in a time of such turmoilThe men have struck a mutually beneficial deal Trump solicits Barracks advice regularly asking how his actions are playing with the public Barrack listens deferentially advises Trump to change course without fear of retribution and retains a bond that has outlasted Trumps many personal and financial crisesBarrack said he has often thought about how he has remained a close friend for 30 yearswith a man whose reputation is selfish and egotistical Heres what I think the answer is Ive never needed anything from him  I was always subservient to himBarrack said that his life intersected with Trump at soft moments such as discussions about their divorces and children He was at Trumps side during the funeral of Trumps father Fred and they talked for a half-hour about the weight of a hard dad and the baton passing As a result Barrack said he has seen within Trump a kind of compassion at a very lonely levelOut of that has developed a most unusual bond which in turn has enabled Barrack to talk to Trump straight up telling him when he disagrees That has been surprisingly oftenIt is not always fun and no he doesnt come back and say By the way your idea was right or brilliant  Barrack saidBut Barrack cant be fired even if his advice doesnt pan out as has happenedIt was Barrack who persuaded Trump to hire political operative Paul Manafort  whom Barrack first met in Beirut 40 years ago  for the presidential campaign Trump never publicly criticized Barrack for the advice even as Manafort came under investigation by special counsel Robert S Mueller III in a probe examining whether the campaign colluded with RussiaThe 70-year-old Barrack who travels the world by private jet and yachtspeaks in a measured cadence with a diplomatic tone He says he always couches his advice to Trump in an understanding way Others said that Barrack has mastered the art of stroking Trumps ego Either way the two usually talk at least once a weekBarrack believes that Trump suffers by having too many yes men around him The conclusion is surprising given Trumps penchant for attacking anyone who disagrees with himNo he is very good at being told he is wrong Barrack insisted when pressed on this point People dont have the courage to do it He pushes back hard but the people he respects the most are the people who have the most refined and not wimpy point of viewAs Barracks bluntness and closeness to the president have become better known he is sought as a conduit to Trump for sensitive conversations Ive talked to him about things that Ive thought he would be a good person to talk to the president about said Sen Roy Blunt (R-Mo) who got to know Barrack through their work on the 2017 Presidential Inaugural Committee Tom Barrack has a capacity to disagree that others might not have For example Blunt said he thought Barrack was the best person to explain to the president that the challenges he is facing arent uniqueBarrack said Trump listens to his and other views curates them and sometimes tells him I love you but if I listened to you Id still be on The Apprentice Trump was born into wealth but Barracks upbringing hardly presaged that he would become a fellow billionaire His paternal grandfather was a Christian migr from a city called Zahleh that at the time was part of Syria and today is within the borders of Lebanon Barracks father ran a small grocery store in Culver City Calif and the family was raised in a modest home in the shadow of MGM StudiosBarrack became a lawyer and his ability to speak Arabic led to an assignment in 1972 to go to Saudi Arabia to work on a gas deal Barrack played squash with a local Saudi Soon the Saudi brought his brothers It turned out they were all sons of the king of Saudi Arabia Barrack spent many hours listening to the Arabs discuss their world which he said gave him great respect for the society and communityThe princes in turn hired him and he became as he put it the American representative of the boysA roommate at Barracks Beirut apartment introduced him to Manafort who represented a firm doing business with a Saudi construction company They became close friends and four decades later Barrack persuaded Trump to hire Manafort for his presidential campaignBarracks success representing the Saudi princes enabled him to buy a California ranch in 1979 just down a hill from Ronald Reagans Rancho del Cielo estate in California The Secret Service later boarded horses at Barracks ranch and he occasionally went on trail rides and sat around campfires with Reagan I loved him Barrack said of ReaganBarrack first came to national attention in 1982 as a deputy undersecretary to Interior Secretary James Watt a controversial Cabinet member in the Reagan administration who later announced his resignation while at Barracks ranch Later Barrack became entangled in controversy after he gave $70000 to a person who bought the house of Reagan counselor Edwin Meese and then forgave the loan Barrack was called before Congress to answer questions about whether his Interior appointment was a quid pro quo An independent counsel found that there was no evidence Meese was aware of Barracks helpThe experience convinced Barrack that he never wanted to serve in public office They kill their own in Washington Barrack said Hired by the wealthy Bass family of Texas in 1987 Barrack received a phone call to come to Trump Tower to meet a rising star in New York real estateDonald Trump wanted to buy a 20 percent share of the Alexanders department store chain owned by the Bass brothers and take over some of the companys real estate He quickly reached a deal with Barrack to buy the sharesA year later Trump set his sights on the Bass family-owned Plaza Hotel which Trump could see from his office windowYou have the Plaza Trump said according to Barrack I want itBarrack told Trump that the family wanted $410 million for the propertyand Trump surprised him by agreeing to the price in cash Trump later acknowledged that he could never justify the price but said he wanted the trophy property which he later had to give up as a result of a bankruptcy agreementThe sale sealed Barracks reputation as a dealmakerWe then created a great personal friendship Barrack said Our lives went along the same cadence We both got divorced we both had kids the same age we both got remarried and we did different deals togetherWilliam Rogers a Barrack business partner said Barrack could tell Trump that he was wrong in a way few others could accomplish Donald can be a hard man in his opinions Rogers said Tom had the ability to tell Donald things that he didnt want to hear from other people in a way that Donald would say Thank you youre my friend and can say it to me and not offend me In 1991 Barrack created his own company Colony Capital which became Colony NorthStar of which he is executive chairman Barrack realized 50 percent profits for the next two years by investing in distressed properties including some bought from the Resolution Trust the quasi-governmental entity that sold off property held by failing financial institutions Trump was struggling with financial problems in 1994 when Barrack was brought in to help A banker with Chase Manhattan Bank called Barrack and told him that Trumps portfolio including a $100 million loan with Chase for a Manhattan development was in trouble Chase called us in Los Angeles and says to Tom Youre the only person who has ever been able to deal with Donald 100 percent and deal with him reasonably  Rogers said Would you help us with this Because if he doesnt work with us it is going to be really really bad for himBarrack wanted to help his friend and thought he might invest in the dealHe went on a worldwide search for a backer and got a commitment from several members of the Saudi royal familyTrump ultimately decided to go with investors from Hong Kong Still Barracks intervention had been crucial persuading Chase not to foreclose and giving Trump time to line up financingThe two remained close Barrack hired Trump to oversee renovation of a Park Avenue property While there are many stories of Trump stiffing or underpaying partners Barrack said he never had such problemsBy 2005 Fortune magazine profiled Barrack as arguably the best real estate investor on the planet today Barrack told Fortune Im getting out of real estate deals because the market was ready for a crash Trump was quoted saying Tom has an amazing vision of the future an ability to see whats going to happen that no one else can matchBarracks prediction proved true As the 2007 financial crisis pummeled many real estate investors Barrack bought up discounted property or debt He wound up holding part of the debt on a project controlled by Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner who had purchased a 41-story Fifth Avenue office tower at the height of the market and was having trouble making the loan payments When Kushner tried to restructure his debt  meaning some investors would receive less than expected  he flew to California to get Barracks support After Barrack talked with Trump about the matter he went along with Kushners requestAround the same time Barrack helped Manafort loaning Trumps future campaign manager $15 million to refinance a home in the Hamptons Barrack said the loan was repaid in 14 months and was the only financial transaction between the two  Trump and Barrack began talking about the presidency as early as 1987 and the talk grew more serious in 1999 I used to tell him  people dont understand issues and themes they understand candidates and they look to see what is in the heart and character of the candidate and you are great at that Barrack saidWhen Trump announced his candidacy on June 16 2015 Barrack was shocked by what he saidTrump said Mexico was sending rapists and other criminals to the United States and that he would build a great wall that Mexico would pay forBarrack thought to himself Oh my God where are we going with this What did he just say Which I continue to say by the way It is shocking to me that he would talk that way because he is not that way Barrack said Mexico and the rest of Latin America needs kisses and hugs from the president not divisive attacks He suggests that Trump change his motto from Make America Great Again to a more continental theme of Make the Americas Great Again Another stunning moment for Barrack came when Trump  in December 2015 for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until authorities can figure out what the hell is going onBarrack said Trump was trying to pressure Muslim-dominant countries to root out terrorists within their midst Still he said that Trumps ban is one of the things that hit me the hardest because it is the most complexBarracks ancestry fueled his concern He had often visited Zahleh the mountain city that his grandfather emigrated from in 1900 The area now houses strings of settlements of Syrian refugees many of whom barely subsist More than 1 million Syrians have taken shelter in the country of 6 million peopleBarrack visited Zahleh in May 2016 as Trumps proposed Muslim ban continued to dominate campaign coverageLuciano Calestini who at the time was deputy representative of UNICEF-Lebanon took Barrack on a tour of several refugee settlements He had a chance to walk around talk to refugees and think what it would have been like to grow up there Calestini said in a telephone interview He reflected on how easily that could have been him if his grandfather hadnt moved  with no job and destined for a life of just scraping byBarrack speaking about the visit said he thought about how his grandparents had fled the same area amid sectarian and political strife and how little had changed for those unlucky enough to be refugeesBarrack said he frequently talked to Trump about the proposed Muslim ban seeking to explain why the Muslim ban could go over badly in the regionThe president always viewed me as one of the few Arab American friends that he has Barrack said Im telling him Look Islam is the fastest-growing religion in the world You got 2billion Muslims If young Muslims cant find jobs they may turn to terrorism he told Trump  Barrack supported Trumps campaign and shortly after Trump lost the Iowa caucuses he reconnected with his old friend Manafort a longtime Republican consultantI really need to get to Trump Manafort said according to Barrack He told Barrack he wanted to work as Trumps convention manager helping him navigate what they expected would be a contentious affairBarrack who had long been friendly with Kushner as well as Trumps daughter Ivanka said he wrote them an emailurging Trump to hire ManafortManafort soon became part of the campaigns inner circle rising to become chairman He joined Kushner and Donald Trump Jr in a meeting with a Russian lawyer who was said to have damaging information about Hillary Clinton The meeting is now a focus of Muellers investigation into whether Russia colluded with the Trump campaign which all involved in the meeting have deniedManafort resigned in August after reports of his ties to Ukraines former president He belatedly  under the Foreign Agents Registration Act saying his company had been paid $17 million Manaforts complicated financial affairs brought him under intense scrutiny including an early morning FBI raid at his home in Virginia Muellers office and Manafort declined to commentBarrack said he has not been contacted by the Office of Special Counsel or congressional investigatorsBarrack meanwhile stood by Manafort He invited Manafort to accompany him off the coast of Greece on his yacht He got fired and I felt terrible Barrack said When Manafort called he was depressed I said I have got five guys on a boat and Join us He came over and he spent four or five days figuring out what he would do nextThat loyalty has continued Barrack hired Manaforts business partner Rick Gates as deputy chairman of the Presidential Inaugural Committee and then as director of the Washington office of Colony NorthStar Gates declined to comment  Days after Barrack returned from visiting the refugee settlements in Lebanon he turned his attention to giving Trumps campaign financial help Trump had first promised to finance his own campaign But that vow was dropped and Barrack brought in $7million at a fundraising dinner at his palatial home in Santa Monica Then in June 2016 Barrack helped found a political action committee Rebuilding America Now which raised $23million After the election Barrack served as chairman of Trumps inaugural committee raising more than $100 million nearly twice as much as President Barack Obamas record 2009 haul of $53millionBarrack sees it as logical that raising a lot of money could translate into a job offer and that is what happenedYeah I raised the most money for him Barrack said The inauguration in itself was over $100million that we had to raise from scratch So of course he said Would you like Treasury What would you like to do Barrack said he told the president he would prefer to be an outsider Privately he would be the low-profile Trump whisperer and publicly the Trump explainerIn my communities the financial community the media community the entertainment community they really dont like him in a visceral way Barrack said So to the extent that I can try to bridge a tolerance I think I can help him the most Barrack insisted that Americans are starting to witness Trump change He is learning to govern deal with the Democrats building constituenciesAs Trump began his presidency Barrack saw an opportunity to help reshape Middle East policy which was one of Kushners many assignments Barrack reached out to his friends in the Persian Gulf some of whom had been put off by Trumps campaign rhetoric about Muslims and tried to assure them that they could work with the presidentI tell them I know him personally at a very intimate level and the truth is his passion and his compassion and his empathy for them is true and is deep Barrack said even as he acknowledged that drawing these hard lines from 6000 miles away may seem harsh  Barracks Arab dealmaking has for years fueled his business focused on three countries Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates and Qatar Hes done significant business with all of them raising the question of whether that could influence his advice to Trump on Persian Gulf issuesHe worked with Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal the chief executive of a Saudi investment company to buy the Fairmont Hotel chain Royal family members in the United Arab Emirates partnered with him in the Kerzner International hotel company which operates a luxurious hotel called Atlantis The Palm in DubaiSome of Barracks most recent and significant investments have been with funds connected to Qatars royal family In 2010 he worked with partners including the Qatar Investment Authority to buy the Miramax film studio for $660million and was named chairman The purchase brought Barrack full circle from his modest upbringing in the shadow of MGM Studios He became one of the first studio heads to license content to Netflix a strategy that he said enabled him to sell Miramax to Qatari investors for four times what he paid for itIn 2012 a company affiliated with Barracks firm sold property on Italys Sardinian coast to Qatars sovereign wealth fund which is controlled by the emir and the royal family Italian officials later launched an investigation into whether the transaction had been arranged to avoid paying $190 million in taxes  Barrack who has not been charged with wrongdoing has denied avoiding taxes A Luxembourg entity that handled the transaction for Barracks company has paid a settlement of 22million euros Barrack tried to use his Qatar connection to help Kushner who was for the redevelopment of 666 Fifth Avenue the troubled 41-story office tower Barrack had once invested in Barrack said he told the former prime minister of Qatar to consider investing in the Kushner Cos property but the deal never happenedAt the same time the Arab nations have poured their sovereign wealth into the investment funds run by Barracks company Barrack declined to provide specifics Barracks relationships have been complicated by tensions among the Persian Gulf nations Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have led the effort to break relations with Qatar and impose an embargo for its alleged terrorism ties Qatar which hosts a US military base with 10000 American military personnel says it is a staunch US allyBarrack stressed he is not picking one friend over the other It should be clear that I am friends and have been partners with all three of these Middle East countries at issue Barrack said Barracks most public effort to influence policy came in a pre-election Fortune  in which he called for the United States to back a Marshall Plan that would aid the poor and said there must be a radical shift in  [US] outreach toward the Arab world Barrack introduced Kushner to Yousef al-Otaiba the influential UAE ambassador to the United States and the two have spoken regularly Otaiba declined to commentBarrack said he sees no conflict raised by his business dealings and his advice to Trump saying he is just trying to be an honest individual that has a lot of experience in the region and that he would not risk his reputation by trying to use his ties to Trump for financial gain My objective is to just try and create a tapestry in which all three of them weave a solution Barrack saidDana Shell Smith the US ambassador to Qatar from 2014 to June of this year said Tom Barrack is perhaps one of the only people in the world who understands the parties well enough and knows all of them well enough including our administration to help bring an end to the crisisNotwithstanding the success of Barrack and his administration allies in modulating Trumps view Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates continue to impose their blockade of Qatar and the crisis continues Alice Crites contributed to this reportLeaders of a historic  in Alexandria have decided to remove a pair of plaques from its sanctuary that memorialize two of their most prominent parishioners George Washington and Robert E Lee In a letter sent Thursday to members of the Christ Church congregation church leaders explained that the decision came after much deliberation This was not a discussion we entered into lightly but rather a sincere attempt to have a family conversation about our worship space our larger history and our future they wrote The fate of the two plaques which have hung on either side of the altar at the historic church since 1870 had been talked about for years according to the Rev Noelle York-Simmons the churchs rector But the matter took on added urgency following events in Charlottesville One person was killed and several injured  Aug 12 after a rally by white nationalists protesting the planned removal of a statue of Lee While recognizing the important roles both Washington and Lee played in the nations history church leaders wrote that the decision was made that it would be best to remove them because they create a distraction in our worship space and may create an obstacle to our identity as a welcoming church and an impediment to our growth and to full community with our neighborsNews of the churchs decision was first reported by the  website York-Simmons and other church leaders spent much of September discussing the matter with members of the 1800-person congregation   York-Simmons characterized the meetings and listening sessions as hearteningPeople responded beautifully and faithfully listening in a lot of ways that showed our church at its best she saidYork-Simmons would not discuss whether there were parishioners who advocated for keeping the plaques Im not going to speak for my parishioners We have been through an intense process of listening to our communitys thoughts on all sides of the complicated issue she saidThe nations first president and the commander of the Confederate army both played significant roles in the early history of Christ Church Washington was a regular worshiper Lee and his family were also parishioners Mary Custis Lee Robert E Lees wife gifted the church $10000 to help begin its endowmentEven though much of the recent national debate has centered around Civil War memorials church leaders said they thought that it was important for the plaques to be considered together They noted that both were placed at the same time and visually balance each other in a way that maintains the symmetry of the churchs sanctuary We understand that both Washington and Lee lived in times much different than our own and that each man in addition to his public persona was a complicated human being and like all of us a child of God church leaders wroteChrist Church founded in 1773 is not the only congregation to struggle with how to balance their legacy with shifting views about historical figures After two years of tense debate an Episcopal parish in Lexington Va named for Lee who was once a prominent member  its name York-Simmons said the plaques will remain in place until a new location for them is identified some time next year A committee will be formed to deliberate on a new place of respectful prominence  While some may criticize the churchs decision York-Simmons emphasized that this is not about changing the past but about finding a way to place the churchs history in the proper context We are deeply committed to our history but even more we are deeply committed to the worship of Jesus Christ she said The question is how can we reflect bothThe House on Thursday passed a bill introduced by Rep Barbara Comstock (R-Va) that would expand the authority of the federal government to deport or detain non-citizen immigrants who are gang members or suspected of gang activityThe legislation offered as a response to an increase in killings perpetuated by the resurgent MS-13 gang in the Washington region and nationally would allow officials to take action against suspected gang members regardless of whether theyve been convicted of a crimeThe bill was slammed by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the American Civil Liberties Union which argued it would promote racial profiling erode due process and unintentionally affect others such as clergy who try to help gang membersThe  was approved 233 to 175 It drew opposition from the four Democrats who serve alongside Comstock in the Virginia delegation Rep Don Beyer (D-Va) whose district borders Comstocks spoke against it on the House floor Six of the seven Republicans in the delegation voted in support Rep Thomas Garrett did not cast a ballotAlthough the bill is unlikely to pass the Senate in its current form that President Trumps advisers would recommend he sign it as isThe bill is in keeping with a strategy used by Comstock who is seeking reelection in 2018 to a third term to focus on local issues important to her suburban Northern Virginia district such as crime and transportationThe approach helped her keep her seat last year while sharing a ballot with President Trump who lost her district by 10 pointsDemocrats and Republicans say Comstocks district could be among the most competitive in the 2018 midterm elections which are expected to be a referendum on TrumpThe presidents unpopularity in the district which stretches from the Washington suburbs to rural counties along the West Virginia border and is anchored by Loudoun County motivated eight Democrats to seek the party nomination to challenge the congresswomanComstock has said she wants to continue work done by her predecessor longtime congressman Frank Wolf to combat gang violenceIn a speech on the House floor Thursday she said the bill will ensure that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can act immediately when they identify a known MS-13 gang memberWe dont have to wait until these brutal killers wield their machete or leave a body on a childrens playground she said referring to the November 2015 murder of a man whose  He died of stab wounds to the head and neckSince November 2016 Comstock said authorities have tied at least eight murders in Northern Virginia to MS-13 and the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force believes as many as 4000 gang members live in the Washington region  Comstocks bill was sponsored by Rep Bob Goodlatte (R-Va) chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Rep Peter T King (R-NY) and Rep Ral R Labrador (R-Idaho) who spoke in favor of itGoodlatte said whether immigrants are here illegally or have visas or permanent resident status it is time to send the message that this behavior simply will not be toleratedKing said MS-13 had turned his district into killing fields where 17 young people have been murdered by gang members in the past year and a half The New York City Police Department and the Sergeants Benevolent Association endorsed the bill he saidWe cannot allow gang members to be taking advantage of loopholes in our immigration laws King saidDemocrats speaking against the bill said they agreed there must be a way to curtail MS-13 but Comstocks bill would have unintended consequences and face legal challenges We all agree MS-13 is a problem and I think shed be better served by working in a bipartisan manner to find a responsible solution rather than doing something on her own thats probably dead on arrival in the Senate Beyer said after the voteImmigrant advocates objected to the bill saying it would give law enforcement wide latitude in designating groups of people as gangs and seeking to deport detain or block their asylum before a crime has been committedThis feels just like yet another barely thinly veiled attempt to criminalize and demonize immigrants in order to justify what this administration has consistently promoted as their commitment to a massive deportation regime said Avideh Moussavian a senior policy attorney at the National Immigration Law CenterShe called it a shameful slapping of labels on immigrants to justify infractions of due process and human rightsLawmakers debated the bill on Capitol Hillof a Wednesday night dinner over which they discussed a deal to potentially protect dreamers undocumented immigrants brought to this country as children Rep Luis V Gutirrez (D-Ill) said congressional Democrats should not accept amnesty for the dreamers in exchange for new

animated GIF featuring Pope Francis giving a skeptical lookThese are just some of the reasons as far as anyonecan tell that President Trumphas blocked people on TwitterAmid  for the president of the United States to bar exchanges with certain constituents on his preferred platform of communication a group of people has stepped into the spotlight those who have been #BlockedByTrumpThe latest targets may be a veterans group and the author Stephen King who has already attracted celebrity sympathyTrump has blocked me from reading his tweets I may have to kill myself Stephen King (@StephenKing) In the 24 hours before his alleged blocking the writerhad tweeted about  and the Trump Cabinets for their president Kinghad previously mocked Trumps baseless wiretapping allegations as only a couldFor many getting singled out on Twitter by the leader of the free world is so bizarre that when it happens there tends to be a sense of awe mixed with indignation and disbelief For others it has become a strange new badge of honor with newly blocked users  by previously blocked onesWelcome to the blocked club  I brought cake  Holly OReilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) The club may now also include VoteVetsorg a liberal veterans group whichshared what it claims is a screenshot of its block notificationThe Commander in Chief can block  the voice of 500k military veterans and families but we will NOT be silenced  VoteVets (@votevets) The group posted to Facebook the tweets itposted in reply to the presidents recent tweets which criticized Trumps travel restrictions the Russia controversy and moreThe Commander in Chief can block VoteVetsorg on Twitter the voice of 500000 military veterans and families but we will NOT be silencedPosted by  onThe alleged blocking has provoked a response from criticsSad that our draft deferring Commander in Chief is unwilling to hear the voice for over 500000 veterans   Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) Has someone created a Tweets by Donald Trump acct that would immediately post his tweets for  & all to see  Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) Will Fischer VoteVets director of government relations told Voxcom that blocking the organization on Twitter is not just being unresponsive to veterans but about being responsive to any voice of dissent whatsoeverIts difficult to say for certain how many people Trump has blocked because a userslist of blocked accounts isnt public (This report relied on screen shots from those who said they had been blocked)But it is an experience that a growing number of people say they shareHOLY [S] HE ACTUALLY DID IT Jules Suzdaltsev a freelance journalist based in San Francisco  accompanied by screen shots of Trumps suddenly inaccessible (to him) personal Twitter account I told Trump to spend more time with his son AND HE BLOCKED MESuzdaltsev was caught off guard when what he considered a fairly harmless series of tweetsfinally spurred Trump to block him Usually acritic of the president Suzdaltsev saidhe had started out by affirming Trumps opinion that  and agreeing that her joke was tasteless and stupidHe then followed with some unsolicited advice for Trump to spend more time with his youngest son BarronAlso and I mean this sincerely you NEED to spend more time with Barron instead of golfing every single weekend Jules Suzdaltsev (@jules_su) I mean Jesus take him golfing WITH you It seriously breaks my heart what youre doing to Barron he is the only Trump I like Jules Suzdaltsev (@jules_su) And just like that Trumps Twitter feed was suddenly closed off to SuzdaltsevI was elated he told The Washington Post Maybe initially bittersweet but when I realized I could still reply I was absolutely elatedSuzdaltsev certainly wasnt trying to get himself blocked by the president but he wasnt holding back either He had been tweeting at Trump regularly since just before the inauguration often with over-the-top aggressive missives that challenged Trumps intelligence his appearance and more Often Suzdaltsev says he couldnt help himselfFirst of all hes incredibly easy to respond to Suzdaltsev said Other times hell say things that are vividly untrue Its almost like theres this compulsion to prove that Youre not fooling anyone I dont care if youre the president This is the stupidest thing Ive ever heard anyone say By then Suzdaltsev had become one of a vocal group of verified Twitter users who relished in racing to be the first to comment anytime Trump tweeted The overwhelming number of retweets and likes he got for each retort if phrased and timed just right  had become entertaining gratifying and yes a little addictiveIt did amazing things for my engagement he saidEventually it also got him blockedBut in late May word spreadthat after she tweeted at @realDonaldTrump to say that his trip to the Middle East had been embarrassingOH MY EFFING GODThe President of the United States just blocked me on Twitter because I hurt his feelings   Bess Kalb (@bessbell) I thought oh thats quite unsettling because I never expected that that would happen and Id always been a little afraid of that Suzdaltsev said of Kalb getting blocked But I sort of thought Im not going to change because thats the definition of a chilling effectFor Rob Szczerba a tech executive in Upstate New York who rarely tweeted about anything political before Trump it was the post-inauguration spat over crowd size that sucked him into the Twitter gameYoure just thinking toyourselfWhy would you get all bent out of shape about that Szczerba told The Post That just seems kind of sillyLike Suzdaltsev Szczerba got into the habit of trying to come up with rapid humorous responses to Trumps tweets He set up his notifications to alert him whenever Trump posted to Twitter And like others his replies to the president were usuallymet with hundreds if not thousands of likes and retweetsIf you promise not to release any classified information on your trip youll get an extra scoop of ice cream at dinner  Rob Szczerba (@RJSzczerba) Usually theyre fairly blunt Szczerba said of the presidents tweets I never really tweeted anything threatening or use profanity in any way I tried to use humorEven that was not enough to prevent Trump from hitting the block button on him On the night of June 1 the same day Trump announced that the United States would be withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement Szczerba fired off a criticism of the decision  in the form of a dad jokeI heard  is a new flavor from Ben & Jerrys But its mostly just nuts   Rob Szczerba (@RJSzczerba) When he checked Trumps profile shortly afterward he realized he had been blockedI was almost laughing when I got blocked Szczerba said Like seriously  what youre blocking me overSzczerba said he doesnt know whether Trump himself is doing the blocking or whether its someone on his staff Either way he thinks its counterproductive For one there are still ways through third-party apps to view and respond to a Twitter account that has blocked youWhen youre blocked it shows that someones actually reading these things and somebodys gotten under your skin Szczerba said As a politician  responding in this sort of manner doesnt seem to be in your best interestOther last tweets to Trump that reportedly triggered a presidential block include disses of Trumps approval ratings even calls for his impeachmentUNBLOCK ME YOU COWARD Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) LOLwelcome to the  club He blocked me TWO years ago because I called him a cartoon character MacKenzie L (@run_mac_run) Trump Blocked me on Twitter For Saying He Doesnt Care About Our Grandchildren     Aunt Crabby (@DearAuntCrabby) PS looking at the date this was probably the one that caused him to block me     Tara Dublin (@taradublinrocks) This was my last tweet to Trump before he BLOCKED me  Holly OReilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) Did I make death threats against him Did I use foul language or threaten his family Holly OReilly aka @AynRandPaulRyan wrote in a  of  None of the aboveI told him that the pope looked at him funny OReilly saidAt first she couldnt help but laugh at the absurdity of it all  but soon her laughter gave way to anger she wroteIts one thing if the president blocks me Im just one person and I can certainly do something else with those five minutes of my day But when he began systematically blocking dozens of people who simply didnt agree with him thats when I started to worry that this is something more than just one person blocking another one This is an elected official trying to silence an entire sector of the dissenting populace This is what dictators and fascists do This isnt what we do here in AmericaOReilly has since joined a group that is alleging that Trumps blocking of her on Twitter violates her First Amendment rights Trump is not the only elected officialwho has been blocking his or her constituents on Twitter With the writer King its unclear if he was actually blocked (Maybe its a hoax he tweeted) Kingcould not be reached immediately for comment Buthe has drawn a Thanks Maybe its a hoax Im good either way Ill always have Pence hahahaha Stephen King (@StephenKing) For many others being blocked by Trump is a less serious matter something to trumpet in Twitter bios and reminisce about with Its kind of viewed as a little bit of a badge of honor that you got blocked Szczerba saidTwitter user Tony Posnanski is just one of a few who turned his notification that Trump had blocked him into his Being blocked by Donald Trump  is the new verified life is lit rn you guys  Jules Suzdaltsev (@jules_su)The troopsthat recently recaptured Palmyra Syria from the Islamic State included Syrian Iranian and Hezbollah forces And onMonday Russian officials  there was another group that contributed to the victory Russias elite special forces also known as SpetsnazRussian troops are nothing new to the Syrian ground war Since their arrival in September the Russians have used naval infantry to secure a key port in Tartus and the perimeter of an airfield in Latakia But Russian special forces operating on the front  aside from a small number of artillery and tank units  have remained mostly out of the public eyePosted by  onWith the seizure of Palmyra though that is no longer the case Russian officialsannounced Monday that Palmyra was liberated with participation of Spetsnaz and military advisers The Islamic State took Palmyra in May and shortly afterpartially destroyed a number of the citys historic sitesRussian special forces have come to the forefront of Russias Syria narrativebecause the battle for Palmyra plays directly into the anti-Islamic State rhetoricthat Russia used as a pretense to initially intervene said Chris Kozak a research analyst at the Institute of the Study of War  Involvement of Russian special forces in Palmyra looks great Kozak said Whereas their involvement against opposition groups in Aleppo or Latakia doesnt fit the narrativeIt is unclear exactly when Russian special forces began operating in Syria though prior to Russias intervention there Russian troops hadlong helped adviseand trainSyrian forces According to Michael Kofmanan analyst at CNA who focuses on Russian military operations Russia currently operates several special forces units in Syria Zaslon KSO and detachments of reconnaissance teamsPart of the Russias Foreign Intelligence Service Zaslon is a highly secretive detachment often responsible for security in high-threatareas KSO is Russias equivalent to the USJoint Special Operations Command and was formedwithin the past fewyearsRussian special forces are doing a lot of the targeting for Russian airstrikes and a lot of advising for the Syrians Kofman said adding that they provide most of the intelligence on the ground for Russian airpower and helprun Syrian operationsUnlike the majority of US special forces that are currentlyadvising Iraqi and Syrian forces from behind the lines at the battalion and brigade levels Russian special forces appear to beparticipating in combat alongside Syrian troops at the tactical levelThe presence of Russian special forces and advisers on the front line has in turnhelpedSyrian troops and President Bashar al-Assads allies consolidate gains and take ground acrossthe country According to Kofman Russian military advisers on the grounddespite the hype surrounding the detachment of Russianaircraft in the country arethe glue that is helping the Syrians fight as a much more capable army  Its really hard to make that much of a difference with suchfew planes even though they have flown at a very high rate Kofman saidRussia has played a significant role inAssads attempts to reverse almost half a decade of losses to opposition groups Jabhat al-Nusra and the Islamic State Yet in recent months Iranian troops Hezbollah forces and a slew of militias have also significantly bolstered the fledgling Syrian army as wellBut Russias involvement in ground operations has not been without its cost Just days prior to Russias announcement that Spetsnaz forces helped liberate Palmyra the Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed Russian official who said aspecial forces soldier died heroically after calling airstrikes ontohis own position after he was surrounded by the Islamic State Following the announcement of the soldiers death the story went Much like itsintervention in Ukraine Russia has been slow  the deaths of any of troops in Syria  usually acknowledging them months after the deaths To date Russia has acknowledged the deaths of seven Russian service members in Syria According to Kofman Russia has been more open to announcing deaths in the fight for Palmyra The deaths he said reinforce the image that Russia is primarily operating in Syria to defeat the Islamic StateStill there is a limit to the opennessThe Russian government has not disclosed the total number of casualties in the fight to retake PalmyraIn recent weeks the Islamic State claimed to have killed a number of Russian special forces soldiers In one instance a news agency associated with the extremist group posted what appeared to be the gear belonging to a Russian special forces soldier In that instance the soldiers gear featureda number of items including an that could havebelonged to a special forcessoldierThe Islamic State also posted pictures supposedly from that soldiers phone showing images of the dead soldier and members of hisunit It is unclear whetherthe equipment and the photosare from the same soldier as that the soldiers from theunit pictured on the phone belongto a contracting group not Russian special forcesFirst Facebook wanted you to like things Then Facebook gave you an array of emotions wow haha love sad and angry Choose an emotion instead of just a like and your friends get a better sense of how you feel about their posts But doing so also tells Facebook something about youAnd that is one big reason Ben Grosser an artist and a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who describes his work as writing software in order to investigate the social effects of software made an extension that randomizes what you tell Facebook about how youre feeling Its called  and Ill be honest it made Facebook likes a little terrifying for me when I first installed itHeres how it works With Go Rando running each time you click like on a post from your news feed the extension intercepts that like and randomly selects one of Facebooks six reactions That reaction is what shows up on the post Click like and you might end up loving the post Click like on another post and it might show up as sadWith Go Rando running I clicked like on a post from a friend who was passing along a list of job openings at hisworkplace My reaction showed up as sad I was angry about a romantic Valentines Day post from one of my closest friends Thankfully like any like on Facebook Go Rando likes let you unlike as well And if you want to pick your reaction for say a more sensitive post from a friend the extension will let you do that in exactly the same way that you choose an emotion on Facebook without the extension getting involved  But Go Rando works closest to Grossers intentions when you interfere with it the least The idea is essentially that all those random emotionsconfuse the data you give Facebook By creating random reactions to the posts you like you stop telling Facebook how you genuinely feel With enough use youll appear more or less balanced to the site Grosser said in an interviewIt disrupts the usefulness of this emotional reaction data that Facebook is collecting he said It disconnects how we feel from the data thats getting recorded No longer will my emotions line up neatly with easy analytic pictures of my personality Over time as you use Go Rando instead of creating a picture of Oh he likes those things Oh he hates those things instead its going to look like Im neutralGrosser uses the term emotional surveillance to talk about what Go Rando is supposed to confound Emotional surveillance meansusing our activity online to ascertain how we feel and to connect how we feel with our interests our hopes our fears in order to more effectively analyze our personalities he said And that sort of personality analysis is useful for the purposes of message targeting predictive analytics and a bunch of other thingsAs of last year  in its news feed but it has also made it clear in the past that it intends to use it for this purpose some time in the future Facebook said it had no updates on its use of reactions data in the News Feed when we reached out this weekWe already know that Facebook is interested in how you feel  and that likes in general are a driving force behind the algorithms that determine what you see in your news feed The very purposeof the like button as  is to enlist its users in solving the problem of how best to filter their own news feeds without even thinking about itFor Grosser thats a phenomenon worth examining How we feel or how we report how we feel on Facebook has all kinds of implications for what we see in the future on Facebook Grosser told me By randomizing what you report to the site youre essentially telling Facebook that you feel each available emotion about the same number of times and not necessarily for the same sorts of posts One day for instance you might love a post containing a link to a news story that is critical of President Trump The next day you might be angry at a similar thingFacebooks previous interest in emotional manipulation is one reason Grosser decided to create a project examining these reactions In2014 Facebook revealed that it had run a highly controversial study on a subset of its users It manipulated what they saw on their news feeds showing some users more positive posts than normal and showing others more negative posts Then Facebook used keywords from those users status updates to determine their overall mood (The study in case you were interested found that the users who saw more positive posts had more positive status updates and that those who saw more negative posts had more negative updates You can )Grossers work is generally based on a simple concept  adding to or removing a normal part of an online experience to make you think about why its there in the first place He made another Facebook-based extension for instance that removes all the numbers from the platform Thebecame the subject of a research paper by Grosser that highlighted the worrying importance quantification plays in feeding our addiction to social media Go Rando is also in that vein The app contains an element of chaotic fun (and a bit of mild social danger) but its also designed to make you think about how you react on Facebook in the first place and who benefits from you doing it Liking has become a compulsive behavior Grosser said Go Rando makes you pause  The things you tell Facebook tell the company about you But they also tell any  advertisers political campaigns anyone who might want to target a particular demographic with a message or product  things about you too And as a reward for all that useful knowledge Facebook gives the user a feed thats designed to display things that will keep them sharing liking and loving That feed can easily become a bubble that shows you the world as youd like to see it  as opposed to the world as it isAlthough Go Rando still tells Facebook that you reacted to something at allconfusing random emotions or not my short experience using it definitely helped me pause each time to think about whyIn the final hours of the 2017 Maryland legislative session five male senators tried to hash out an agreement on a bill that would allow a woman who becomes pregnant during a rape to terminate the attackers parental rights At least 21 other states have adopted similar laws But in Annapolis the bill failed for the ninth time in as many years with key members of a conference committee panel balking at the idea of terminating rights if the alleged rapist has not been criminally convicted This time the bills defeat  and triggered an outcry from advocates The two committee chairmen who appointed the conference panel were blasted for waiting until the very end of the 90-day legislative session  and for not including any women in the groupThe criticism in some ways has overshadowed what advocates describe as victories on other bills that address the way rape is prosecuted and the options available to survivors of sexual assaultThis was an important year for rape crisis centers for rape survivors    I dont want that to be lost on the demise of this bill said Del Kathleen M Dumais (D-Montgomery) sponsor of the parent rights legislationThere is a much stronger awareness of the victims of sexual assault and a better sensitivity to the issue overall she said Its happening nationally and Im glad to see it happening in MarylandAfter two failed attempts more than a decade ago Maryland lawmakers this year passed a  bill which says no evidence of physical resistance is needed to prove sexual assault The General Assembly also approved a measure that  by including all nonconsensual sexual violations and eliminating any reference to gender And it passed bills increasing the amount of time have to sue their abusers and requiring law enforcement to preserve the evidence in rape kits for 20 yearsLisae Jordan the executive director of the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault said advocates made substantial progress for sexual assault survivors during the recent sessionDel Shelly L Hettleman (D-Baltimore County) who sponsored the bill to preserve rape kits said she pushed for a statewide standard after showed a huge disparity in how long the kits were preserved Some law enforcement agencies kept the evidence forever while others destroyed it after nine monthsHaving the preservation of this material gives some of the decision-making power back to the survivor Hettleman said by giving rape victims more time to decide whether to file charges The no means no bill was necessary advocates say because police and prosecutors were not adhering to a 2010 state Court of Appeals rulingthat a victim saying no and pushing an assailants hand away was enough to meet the states force or threat of force requirement for proving sexual assault Under the new statute that force or threat of force threshold no longer existsAdvocates say the threshold is one reason  of law enforcement officials declaring rape allegations unfounded An audit last year showed that one-third of cases closed as unfounded in the county between 2013 and 2015 were categorized that way after victims told police they had not fought their attackers There is a clear cultural shift between 2004 when the no means no bill was originally introduced and this year Jordan said This year many said that absolutely should be law There was no similar shift however among legislative leaders charged with deciding the fate of the paternity-rights legislationThe primary reason according to advocates of the bill and those are skeptical of it lies in the differences between civil andcriminal courtCivil procedure is looked at differently Dumais said Thats where there is still some misunderstanding I guess is the softer way to characterize it There is a mistrust of the civil systemUnder the bill a woman who sought to terminate a mans parental rights would have to prove through clear and convincing evidence the standard used in civil court that the man had sexually assaulted her The burden-of-proof standard is higher in criminal courtwhere charges must be proved beyond a reasonable doubtSen Robert A Zirkin (D-Baltimore County) chairman of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee said he was troubled with the idea of a man potentially losing his parental rights without being convicted of sexual assaultIts a complicated bill Zirkin said There are protections in criminal law that do not apply in civil casesBut advocates argue that the state allows parental rights to be terminated in child-abuse cases even when there is no criminal child-abuse conviction The same standard should apply they say in cases of sexual assault They also say that most rape cases go unreported and unprosecuted If the bill applied only to convicted rapists victims who chose not to file criminal charges would not be able to terminate the parental rights of their attackersAdvocates say women rarely seek to terminate an attackers parental rights even in states that have laws allowing them to do so easily Jordan said she suspects that victims who become pregnant as a result of an assault instead choose to abort or go into hiding She said if the bill had passed she would expect more women in Maryland to try to terminate the parental rights of their assailants by taking legal actionThe House unanimously passed the rights-termination bill on March 9 The Senate did not take up the measure until April 6 five days before the end of session The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee struck language from the bill that said that courts could not require publication of the name of the mother or child and added language that said the father could refuse to testify or offer evidence in courtThose changes meant that a conference committee composed of delegates and senators from the committees that had first considered the bills would have to negotiate final wording that could then be taken up again by the full House and SenateZirkin appointed himself Sen William C Smith Jr (D-Montgomery) and Sen Michael J Hough (R-Frederick) to the conference committee passing over the two female lawmakers on the judicial proceedings panelZirkin declined to say why he did not place Sen Delores G Kelly (D-Baltimore County) or Sen Susan C Lee (D-Montgomery) on the panel Instead he noted that Smith was a co-sponsor of the bill and one of the strongest advocates for it on his committeeThat doesnt mean that you shouldnt have women on a conference committee discussing rape and pregnancy Jordan said Del Joseph F Vallario Jr (D-Prince Georges) chairman of the House Judiciary Committee waited until late afternoon on the final day of the legislative session to name himself Del David Moon (D-Montgomery) and Del Brett R Wilson (R-Washington County) to the conference committee He was absent when the group finally convened at 10 pm two hours before the legislature would adjournVallario who voted for the original version of the bill when it passed the House did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this article He told the Baltimore Sun that the makeup of the committee was coincidentalMoon a strong proponent of the legislation said he thought the panel was set up for an impossible challengelacking enough time and commitment from members to resolve differences between the House and Senate bills and get the legislation back to each chamber for a vote Dumais said she doesnt think the makeup of the panel defeated the bill given the support from Moon Smith and WilsonStill she said said Zirkin and Vallario should have included women in the groupThe optics of an all-male panel are horrible in the year 2017 Moon said It was politically tone-deafThe controversy over President Trumps treatment of fallen service members escalated Monday its eighth straight day when the grieving widow of one of four US soldiers killed in Niger  and described how the presidents blunders on his condolence call left her angry and in tearsThough Trump insisted he had been very respectful the widow Myeshia Johnson said on ABCs Good Morning America that Trump told her that her husband knew what he signed up for but it hurts anyway She said the presidents comments made me cry because I was very angry at the tone of his voiceJohnson said that Trump did most of the speaking on their call which occurred last Tuesday and that he did not seem to remember the name of her husband Army Sgt La David Johnson who was killed in Niger on Oct 4 under circumstances that military officials have not fully explainedI heard him stumbling on trying to remember my husbands name Johnson told ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos And thats what hurt me the most because if my husband is out here fighting for our country and he risked his life for our country why cant you remember his name And thats what made me upset and cry even more because my husband was an awesome soldierTrump rejected Johnsons account  about an hour after the interview was broadcast I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt La David Johnson and spoke his name from beginning without hesitationTrump ignored questions about the issue shouted by reporters later in the dayThe fight pitting the commander in chiefs words against those of the pregnant widow of a fallen soldier  as well as those of Rep Frederica S Wilson (D-Fla) a friend of the Johnson family who has detailed and sharply criticized Trumps handling of the condolence call  has distracted from the administrations agendaThe episode has also threatened to stain the credibility of White House Chief of Staff John F Kelly a retired Marine Corps general who lost one of his sons in the war in Afghanistan and who had been viewed by many in Washington as a key moral authority in the administrationWere cruising toward a war with North Korea and for eight days weve watched inane behavior by the president Congresswoman Wilson and the chattering class in Washington retired four-star Army general Barry McCaffrey said It really makes me sick to be honest Im sure his phone call with the widow was absolutely disastrous He wings stuff He doesnt have any empathy But I think theres a larger issue What are we doing hereReflecting on the past eight days McCaffrey added Im starting to wonder if the countrys losing its moorings  The drama began last Monday with a falsehood by Trump A reporter asked him during a news conference why he had been silent for 12 days about  in Niger the deadliest combat incident since he took office Trump responded defensively falsely asserting that his predecessors including President Barack Obama never or rarely called family members of service members who were killed on their watch In fact they regularly didTrumps actions since then have followed a careful formula that he long ago devised for winning a skirmish and that has been described by senior White House advisers Make it a fight use controversy to elevate the message and never apologizeThe conflict bears all the hallmarks of a typical Trump rumble over-broad boasts inconsistent official accounts tweeted name-calling partisan attacks aides ensnared in controversy and a steady effort to pin the blame for the whole hullabaloo on the news mediaTrump grew up in a New York PR and media environment of Page Six beefing and gossiping so he looks at his whole life through that window said Rick Wilson a Republican strategist and a vocal Trump critic His philosophy of always fighting back is morally divorced from any other situation And to stay in Trumps good graces his aides have to play that gameTrumps treatment of the Johnson family and his mockery of Wilson have reopened wounds with African Americans many of whom see a pattern of racial prejudice by this president noting his past attacks on ESPN sportscaster  former national security adviser and other black women We are sick and tired of women being undermined being dismissed and black women in particular Rep Maxine Waters (D-Calif) a longtime member of the Congressional Black Caucus  as she defended Wilsons integrity Brittany Packnett an activist affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement  that Trumps treatment of Johnson is representative of something bigger Donald Trump doesnt respect black women  In a drama that has inflamed Americans on both sides of the political spectrum Trump and Kelly disregarded Washington conventions of civility personal reputation and fidelity to factWithout Trumps rules of engagement the bungled effort to soothe a mourning widow could easily have been resolved with a simple statement of clarification from the president But Trump chose otherwise and Kelly followed him into the breach along with White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee SandersInitially lost in the fireworks was Johnson the widow whose feelings had been channeled by Cowanda Jones-Johnson the soldiers aunt who raised him as a son and Wilson a longtime family friend Both women were in a limo with Johnson driving to meet her husbands body when Trump called and they overheard the conversation on speakerphone  Trump initially denied Wilsons account of the call as a total fabrication  even though Kelly later confirmed that he had coached Trump to say roughly what Wilson said he told Johnson  and repeatedly attacked the lawmaker as wacky He tweeted that attention on her was killing the Democrat PartyKelly labeled Wilson an empty barrel and accused her of political grandstanding by  that she had inappropriately claimed credit in a 2015 speech for securing funding for a federal building Video of the event shows that Wilson did no such thing and the congresswoman has called on Kelly to  for what she termed character assassinationEighteen women from the Congressional Black Caucus demanded an apology from Kelly on Sunday Wilsons integrity and credibility should not be challenged or undermined by such blatant lies their statement readFor her part Sanders amped up the attacks on Wilson by saying the congresswoman was all hat no cattle an apparent swipe at Wilsons habit of wearing colorful sequined cowboy hats Sanders refused to apologize for or correct Kellys false claim about Wilson and she scolded reporters for fact-checking the chief of staff Questioning a four-star general she said was In close adherence to the Trump rules the president and his aides escalated the fight welcomed the controversy and refused to apologize And it might have worked more effectively had the whole enterprise not ended with the president in a standoff with a mourning widowOn Monday Johnson for the first time spoke for herself on the issue saying Wilsons account of her call with Trump was 100 percent correctWhy would we fabricate something like that Johnson told StephanopoulosAsked if there was anything she wanted to say to Trump Johnson replied No I dont have nothing to say to him Kristine Phillips and Eugene Scott contributed to this reportDonald Trump was in his element mingling with beauty pageant contestants and business tycoons as he brought his Miss Universe pageant to Russia for a much-anticipated Moscow debut Nonetheless Trump was especially eager for the presence of another honored guest Russian President Vladimir PutinTrump tweeted Putin a personal invitation to attend the pageant and a one-on-one meeting between the New York businessman and the Russian leader was scheduled for the day before the showPutin canceled at the last minute but he sent a decorative lacquered box a traditional Russian gift and a warm note according to Aras Agalarov a Moscow billionaire who served as a liaison between Trump and the Russian leaderStill the weekend was fruitful for Trump He received a portion of the $14million paid by Agalarov and other investors to bring the pageant to Moscow Agalarov said he and Trump signed an agreement to build a Trump Tower in the heart of Moscow  at least Trumps fifth attempt at such a venture And Trump seemed energized by his interactions with Russias financial elite at the pageant and a glitzy after-party in a Moscow nightclubAlmost all of the oligarchs were in the room Trump bragged to Real Estate Weekly upon returning homeTrumps relationship with Putin and his warm views toward Russia which began in the 1980s when the country was still part of the Soviet Union have emerged as one of the more curious aspects of his presidential campaign  The overwhelming consensus among American political and national security leaders has held that Putin is a pariah who disregards human rights and has violated international norms in seeking to regain influence and territory in the former Soviet bloc In 2012 one year before Trump brought his beauty pageant to Moscow then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney called Russia the United States top geopolitical threat  an assessment that has only gained currency since thenTrump has conveyed a different view informed in part through his business ambitions Since the 1980s Trump and his family members have made numerous trips to Moscow in search of business opportunities and they have relied on Russian investors to buy their properties around the worldRussians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets Trumps son Donald Jr told a real estate conference in 2008 according to an account posted on the website of eTurboNews a trade publication We see a lot of money pouring in from RussiaThe dynamic illustrates the extent to which Trumps worldview has been formed through the lens of commerce rather than the think tanks government deliberations and international diplomatic conferences that typically shape the foreign policy positions of presidential candidatesIt also reflects Trumps willingness to see world leaders through his own personal connections In a Republican Party in which an ability to stand up to Putin has been seen as a test of toughness Trumps relationship with the Russian leader is instead one of mutual flattery Putin said in December that Trump was a colorful and talented person a compliment that Trump said at the time was an honorThe back-and-forth has continued In a mid-June rally Trump cited those comments as the reason he will not reject the Russian leader A guy calls me a genius and Im going to renounce Trump said Im not going to renounce him The next day in St Petersburg Putin again called Trump a colorful person and said he welcomed Trumps proposal for a full-scale resumption of US-Russia tiesOn the campaign trail Trump has called for a new partnership with Moscow overhauling NATO the allied military force seen as the chief protector of pro-Western nations near Russia And Trump has surrounded himself with a team of advisers who have had financial ties to Russia  This account of Trumps 30-year history of business with Russia  and that of his advisers  is based on interviews as well as a review of deposition transcripts and other court records in which Trump and his associates have discussed their overseas work Trump declined to be interviewed for this article as did top campaign aides and most members of his foreign policy team The Kremlin also declined to comment about Trumps visit to MoscowThe coming together of Trumps business and political agendas was evident during his 2013 Moscow trip in which he was seeking deals at the same time he was starting to ponder a presidential runAgalarov and his son Russian pop musician Emin Agalarov told The Washington Post that they befriended Trump after the pageant and listened as he described his views of US-Russia relationsHe kept saying Every time there is friction between United States and Russia its bad for both countries For the people to benefit this should be fixed We should be friends  Emin Agalarov recalledRussia has signaled a deep interest in the US election and in Trump in particular The Russian ambassador to the United States breaking from a tradition in which diplomats steer clear of domestic politics attended Trumps April foreign policy speech in which he called for ending this horrible cycle of hostility between the two nationsAnd in the past week The Post reported that hackers tied to the Russian government had gained access to the Democratic National Committees opposition

hottest places in the world for investment Trump said in a 2007 deposition We will be in Moscow at some point he promisedPart of the allure was what Trump and his associates saw as a huge opportunity  the chance to market American-style luxury apartments to the wealthy elite in a place that still mostly offered utilitarian Soviet-style constructionThe Russian market had natural strength especially in the high-end sector said Donald Trump Jr in his 2008 real estate conference speech Moscow held special appeal because wealthy people throughout the region wanted to own real estate in the capital city he saidTrumps 1987 trip represented his first public exploration of business prospects in Moscow He went with his then-wife Ivana to scope out sites for luxury hotels he hoped to build in a joint venture with the Kremlins hotel and tourism agency according to Trumps memoir  which was published the same yearThe project never got off the ground  an outcome that would repeat itself multiple times

questioned his net worthBut the Russia quest continued In his 2008 speech Donald Jr announced that he had traveled to Russia six times in the previous 18months But he said Russia presented enormous challengesAs much as we want to take our business over there Russia is just a different world the younger Trump said It is a question of who knows who whose brother is paying off who  It really is a scary placeThe elder Trumps business ambitions have extended throughout the former Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc He has explored deals in Kiev Yalta and Warsaw and licensed his name for the construction of a five-star hotel in Baku Azerbaijan which has been mostly built but is not yet openAs Trump looked for deals in Russia Russian consumers became a key market for his real estate projects in the United States and elsewhereTrumps partners on a Panama project traveled to Moscow in 2006 to sell condos to Russian investors according to litigation filed in Florida Trump also sold a mansion in Palm Beach in 2008 for $95million to Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev according to property records Trump had purchased the mansion at a bankruptcy auction less than four years earlier

Putin we would avoid 10 wars every year at least   Birnbaum reported from Moscow Alice Crites Sean Sullivan and Steven Mufson contributed to this reportA delivered to President Obama and President-elect Donald Trump last week included a section summarizing allegations that Russian intelligence services have compromising material and information on Trumps personal life and finances US officials saidThe officials said that US intelligence agencies have not corroborated those allegations but believed that the sources involved in the reporting were credible enough to warrant inclusion of their claims in the  on Russian interference in the presidential campaignTrump however replied Tuesday night with a tweet declaring FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT Early Wednesday  the intelligence community of taking one last shot at meIn Moscow the Kremlin called the report an  Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that its dissemination was an evident attempt to damage our bilateral relations  A senior US official with access to the document said that the allegations were presented at least in part to underscore that Russia appeared to have collected embarrassing information on both major candidates but released only material that might harm Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton  a reflection of Russian motivation that bolstered US spy agencies conclusion that Moscow sought to help Trump winThe inclusion of such unsubstantiated allegations in the election report a development first reported Tuesday by CNN adds a disturbing new dimension to existing concerns about Russias efforts to undermine American democracy And it adds another bizarre twist to an already strange election year injecting new controversy over the Trump teams relations with Russia just when the president-elect is trying to consolidate and launch his new administration   If true the information suggests that Moscow has assembled damaging information  known in espionage circles by the Russian term kompromat  that conceivably could be used to coerce the next occupant of the White House The claims were presented in a two-page summary attached to the full report an addendum that also included allegations of ongoing contact between members of Trumps inner circle and representatives of MoscowThe Russian Embassy did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday night Officials in Moscow this week dismissed the intelligence report on Russian interference in the election and the spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said its accusations have no substanceUS officials said the claims about Russian possession of compromising material were based not on information obtained through traditional intelligence channels but research done by an outside entity engaged in political consulting work and led by a former high-ranking British intelligence official The material was first mentioned in a Mother Jones report in OctoberUS officials said that while the FBI had so far not confirmed the accuracy of the claims US officials had evaluated the sources relied upon by the private firm considered them credible and determined that it was plausible that they would have firsthand knowledge of Russias alleged dossier on TrumpThe CIA the FBI and the White House declined to comment on the matterAfter CNNs report Tuesday Sen Jeff Sessions (R-Ala) Trumps nominee to be the next attorney general was asked at his confirmation hearing about the allegations in the intelligence report If its true its obviously extremely serious Sen Al Franken (D-Minn) said after reading from the CNN report And if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign what will you doSessions responded that he was not aware of any of those activities While saying he had not spoken to Trump about the reports he said allegations get made about candidates all the time and theyve been made about President-elect Trump a lot Dossiers compiled by the former British intelligence official have been circulating in Washington for months Several news organizations including The Washington Post have been attempting to confirm many of the specific allegations without successOne US official said that Trump was briefed on the allegations because they were already circulating widely and it was mostly a courtesy to let him know they were out thereCompiled initially in mid-2016 and supplemented during and after the campaign the reports include detailed allegations that the Russians hold compromising material about Trump some of it obtained while Trump visited Moscow in 2013 for the Miss Universe pageant and on a previous visit to Russia Other reports compiled by the former intelligence official allege contacts between Trump personnel and business officials and Russian officials during the campaign The former intelligence official was at one point paid to explore Trumps ties to Russia by anti-Trump Republicans and later by supporters of the Democratic PartyIf I was the Clinton campaign I would be reaching out to these people who put together the dossier and Id ask for my money back Trump Organization Executive Vice President Michael Cohen told The Washington Post last week Its wrong Theres no accuracy Theres not an ounce of validity to anything that exists in that fileLast month Sen John McCain (R-Ariz) who had been provided with the information personally delivered it to FBI Director James B Comey In a statement early Wednesday McCain said that upon examination of the contents and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy his only involvement in the issue was to hand the information over to authoritiesA source familiar with the matter said the FBI had it well before then and had interviewed the former intelligence official last fall Clintons former campaign spokesman Brian Fallon appealed for a congressional inquiry Mitch McConnell you must let a Select Committee investigate these allegations as @SenJohnMcCain has been urging for weeks Fallon wrote on TwitterKT McFarland Trumps designated national security adviser declined to respond to a question about the report I dont know about the story that youre talking about thats broken she said during participation in a panel Tuesday at the United States Institute of Peace I know in Washington people prefer to talk about something about which they know nothing but Im going to refrain Im not going to say what Donald Trump thinks about the election and what involvement the Russians had I think Id just say what [Director of National Intelligence James R Clapper Jr] said which is that nothing the Russians did had any effect on the outcome Clapper however testified that the report never attempted to assess what effect the Russian intervention had on the election resultThe two-page summary was attached to the most highly classified of three versions of the report on Russian election interference that were circulated in Washington last week including an abbreviated declassified draft that was made publicIt was unclear whether the claims in the summary were even considered by FBI CIA and DNI analysts who were responsible for the main body of the report or whether the information from the outside group had any influence on those analysts conclusionsSenior lawmakers who were briefed on the most classified version of the report declined to comment Rep Devin Nunes (R-Calif) the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the Trump transition team said that we cant comment on what goes on in classified briefings but he added that the idea that Moscow would seek to gather incendiary material on US leaders should not be a surprise to anyoneThe Russians are always looking for dirt on any politician Nunes said That wouldnt be news Asked whether he was aware of any contacts between the Trump team and Russia Nunes said No I found that hard to believe I have

Othersremain Piers MorganAttorney General Jeff Sessions repeatedly refused to answer questions from senators Tuesday about his private conversations with President Trump including whether he spoke to Trump about former FBI director James B Comeys handling of the investigation into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential raceIn a number of testy exchanges with members of the Senate Intelligence Committee Sessions said he would not answer many of their questions because of a long-standing Justice Department policy that he said protects private conversations between Cabinet secretaries and the presidentThe attorney general confirmed elements of  before the same panel last week while disputing others Sessions said he was in an Oval Office meeting in February with Comey and Trump when the president said he wanted to speak to Comey privately  and he acknowledged that Comey came to talk to him the next day about the meetingAt other times though Sessions frequently said he couldnt recall specifics particularly when asked about his meetings with Russian officials during the 2016 campaignAbove all Sessions who served as a senator from Alabama before taking the attorney general post tried to clear his name and win the sympathy of his former colleaguesHe opened his testimony with a fiery assertion that he never had any conversations with Russians about any type of interference in the 2016 presidential electionI was your colleague in this body for 20 years Sessions said The suggestion that I participated in any collusion  is an appalling and detestable lieThe attorney general seemed to understand the import of each of his words as the highest-ranking Trump administration official so far to testify publicly on the FBI investigation and Comeys firing During one line of questioning by Sen Kamala D Harris (D-Calif) he told her in a flash of anger not to rush his answers because youll accuse me of lying and said she was making him nervousSessions took particular aim at news reports about a possible meeting he had with a Russian official during an April 2016 event at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington where Trump gave a pro-Russia speech He acknowledged being at the event and said he had conversations with people there but did not remember any conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey KislyakIf any brief interaction occurred in passing with the Russian ambassador during that reception I do not remember it Sessions saidHe said that he had met twice with Kislyak  once during the Republican National Convention and once in his Senate office  and that he  during his confirmation hearing He said however that he did not remember any other meetings with Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign and did not remember any conversations with Russian officials about the Trump campaignCertainly not one thing happened that was improper in any one of those meetings Sessions saidWhen asked to explain why he wrongly claimed in his confirmation hearing that he never met with Russians Sessions said he was flustered by the question from Sen Al Franken (D-Minn) after many hours of testimonyThe attorney general has since  from the Russia investigation  a decision he sought to cast Tuesday as resulting from his role as an adviser on the Trump campaign rather than because of any inappropriate interaction with Russian officialsI recused myself from any investigation into the campaigns for president but I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations he saidBut Sessionss answers seemed to contradict each other at times particularly when it came to his recusalA March 2 email by Sessionss chief of staff said that he would not be involved in any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for the president of the United States Yet two months later he played a direct role in Trumps decision to fire Comey citing Comeys handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation during the 2016 raceThe recusal involved one case in the Department of Justice and the FBI said Sessions referring to the FBIs Russia investigation and offering a different description of the scope of his recusal Im the attorney general of the United States Its my responsibility to ensure that the department is run properly I do not believe it is a sound position that if you recuse from a single case you cant make a decision about the leadership of that agencySessions previously told senators explicitly that he would recuse himself from matters related to Clinton  though Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said Tuesday that the case was already closed and therefore not part of the recusalWhen asked about his conversation with Comey on the day the president spoke to Comey alone Sessions described the exchange differently than the former FBI chief did in his testimony last weekComey testified that after what he called a disturbing private talk with Trump he went to Sessions Without telling the attorney general that Trump had suggested the FBI drop its probe of former national security adviser Michael Flynn Comey told Sessions It cant happen that you get kicked out of the room and the president talks to me The president has denied asking Comey to drop the Flynn matterComey said that the attorney general didnt say anything but that Sessionss body language gave him the sense that he was powerless to do anythingSessions said he did respond telling Comey that the FBI and the Department of Justice needed to be careful to follow department policies regarding appropriate contact with the White HouseSen Ron Wyden (D-Ore) suggested that the attorney general was ducking critical questions in his testimonyI believe the American people have had it with stonewalling Americans dont want to hear that answers to relevant questions are privileged or off limits Wyden said We are talking about an attack on our democratic institutions and stonewalling of any kind is unacceptableSessions shot back I am not stonewalling I am following the historic policies of the Department of JusticeWyden noted that Comey had said it was problematic for Sessions to oversee the Russia probe for reasons he did not explain in a public settingSessions became angry again when Wyden pressed him to explain what facts might be problematic about his involvement in the probeWhy dont you tell me There are none Senator Wyden There are none Sessions said This is a secret innuendo being leaked out there about me and I dont appreciate itEarlier Tuesday Deputy Attorney General Rod J Rosenstein appeared before lawmakers on the Senate Appropriations Committee He responded to questions regarding comments Monday from Christopher Ruddy the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of Trump that  Mueller was recently appointed to lead the investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 electionRosenstein said that if the president ordered him to fire Mueller he would comply only if the request was lawful and appropriateRosenstein who has been on the job for six weeks said only he could fire Mueller and only if he found good cause to do so He described Mueller as operating independently from the Justice

candidate for president its even harder Thats the experience of current and former senior US officials who on Saturday expressed disbelief at   leveled without any evidence  that President Barack Obama had the candidate wiretapped at Trump Tower before the November election Senior officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because such matters are classified said that there had been no wiretap on TrumpUnder the law governing foreign-intelligence surveillance inside the United States an FBI agent would need to show a federal judge that there is probable cause that the target is an agent of a foreign power  and that requires more than just talking to say the Russian ambassadorBoth criminal and foreign intelligence wiretaps have onerous and strict processes of approval that require not only multiple levels of internal Justice Department review but also require court review and approval said Matthew Waxman an expert on national security law at Columbia UniversityThe law authorizing wiretaps in terrorism and espionage cases is known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 passed out of reforms recommended by a select Senate committee called the Church Committee in the wake of spying abuses by the FBI and the National Security AgencyThe law bars targeted electronic surveillance on US soil unless the government can show that the target was a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power and that the facility  the phone number or email address in question  is being used by the foreign power or agentThe law authorizing criminal intercepts  in cases such as murder drug dealing or racketeering  is Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 Like FISA the law requires probable cause but in this instance that the target is about to or has committed a crimeIn a national security case the FBI working with attorneys in the Justice Departments National Security Division prepare a declaration laying out their grounds for seeking a FISA order A senior intelligence official typically the FBI or CIA director must certify that the purpose is to collect foreign intelligence and that the information cannot be obtained by normal investigative meansThen the package must be approved by a senior Justice official Only three have authority to approve the order the attorney general the deputy attorney general and the head of the National Security DivisionAn NSD attorney would then present the application to  made up of 11 federal district judges appointed by the chief justice of the United States They sit in rotation one judge at a time typically for a week The courts proceedings are highly classified and generally the court hears only the governments side of the caseFollowing the revelations of widespread NSA surveillance by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowdenor public advocate whom the judge can ask to weigh in on significant interpretations of FISAFISA orders rarely are rejected in part because lawyers will withdraw or amend an order if a judge signals it will not pass muster Once approved the order is served on the phone or Internet company that handles the number or email address in questionOn average in recent years there have been about 1400 to 2300 FISA orders a year Each order can contain multiple names and numbers or email addressesIn a criminal case a federal prosecutor goes before a US district judge and presents an application for a Title III order In 2015 according to the Administrative Office of the US Courts there were 1400 wiretap orders covering one or more devices Some experts though citing phone company transparency reports say the offices number appears lowIn the old days FBI agents would attach alligator clips to phone lines Today a technician at a phone company will type into a computer system the number or email address digitally creating another line that goes to an FBI listening post The FBI has separate facilities for criminal wiretaps and national security intercepts The latter are generally recorded for transcription Criminal wiretaps are listened to in real time Under Title III if an agent hears a target talking to someone not involved in the crime  like a pizza deliverer he or she is required to hang up Under FISA any information that does not have foreign intelligence value must be minimized or masked in the transcript That includes the names of US citizens who are picked up speaking to the target unless their identities are relevant to understanding the foreign intelligence  In a typical counterintelligence investigation if an agent is trying to figure out a targets network conversations  even those that might appear innocuous at first  are more likely to be considered relevant Thus the minimization rules for national-security wiretaps are more lenient than those for criminal wiretaps because spies and terrorists generally use more sophisticated tradecraft to evade surveillanceThe communications of people who are speaking to the target are termed incidental The FBI for instance routinely wiretaps the foreign embassies of major adversaries such as China and Russia  including intercepting the cellphone conversations of senior diplomats Anyone speaking to any of these targets would have their conversations picked up as incidental collectionIt is possible some former officials said that there may be recordings of phone conversations between someone in Trump Tower and a Russian official or officials If so the most likely explanation is that the surveillance was being conducted on the Russian officials who historically have been under court-authorized FISA surveillance Those talking to the target would have had their conversations picked up as incidental collectionJustice Department ethics experts have concluded that newly appointed special counsel Robert S Mueller III can oversee the investigation into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin during the 2016 presidential election  even though his former law firm represents several people who could be caught up in the matter authorities announced TuesdayIn an email Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said ethics officials had reviewed the case and determined that Mr Muellers participation in the matters assigned to him is appropriate She said the officials had considered Muellers professional obligations and those imposed by government ethics regulations  Mueller a former FBI director had worked for the past three years in the Washington office of WilmerHale a prominent law firm whose lawyers represent President Trumps former campaign chairman Paul Manafort Trumps daughter Ivanka and the presidents son-in-law Jared Kushner Mueller resigned from the firm after  to oversee the investigation of Russian meddling in the electionBut Mueller still had possible conflicts because of his association with the firm and the Justice Department said at the time it would have to review them Under a federal ethics regulation government officials are barred from participating in matters involving their former employers for a year unless they receive a waiver to do soIn addition professional responsibility rules prohibit lawyers from representing a client and then later using information they have learned through that work against the clientBruce M Berman WilmerHales general counsel told The Washington Post last week that Mueller had no involvement in the representation of Manafort Kushner or Ivanka Trump or any client in connection with any Russia-related inquiryFlores said Mueller and his team would work out of the Patrick Henry Building on D Street NW It is unclear to what extent he will keep current investigators and prosecutors on the case or replace them with his own team WilmerHale lawyers James Quarles and Aaron Zebley also stepped down from WilmerHale last week and a firm spokesman said they were expected to join MuellerKevin Spacey on Sunday responded to accusations that he made a sexual advance on a minor saying that he didnt remember the encounter with actor Anthony Rapp but apologized if I did behave as

saidIn an interview with published Sunday night Rapp said he was in Spaceys apartment for a party in 1986 and at the end of the night Spacey picked Rapp up placed him on a bed and climbed on top of him making an advance The two had known each other for their Broadway work Rapp a child actor at the time was 14 and Spacey was 26 BuzzFeed reportedReports detailing allegations of ongoing sexual harassment and abuse by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein prompted Rapp to speak publicly about Spacey he had told close friends about the encounterthroughout the 1990s and 2000sBuzzFeed reportedI came forward with my story standing on the shoulders of the many courageous women and men who have been speaking out to shine a light and hopefully make a difference as they have done for me Rapp said in a statement Everything I wanted to say about my experience is in that article and I have no further comment about it at this time  The publication notes requests for comment from Spacey went unanswered Then hours later Spacey posted his statement on  writing Im beyond horrified to hear his storyI honestly do not remember the encounter it would have been over 30 years ago Spacey continued But if I did behave then as he describes I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these yearsKnown to be intensely private Spacey then for the first time publicly addressed years of speculation and rumors about his sexual orientationAs those closest to me know in my life I have had relationships with both men and women Spacey wrote I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life and I choose now to live as a gay man I want to deal with this honestly and openly and that starts with examining my own behaviorDemocrat Krishanti Vignarajah a former policy director for first lady Michelle Obama officially launched her campaign for governor Tuesday at the apartment complex outside Baltimore where she lived with her parents after the family fled Sri Lanka decades agoBefore anything else I was an immigrant and proud daughter of schoolteachers she told an audience of about three dozen including her husband National Wildlife Federation chief executive Collin OMara and their infant daughterShe said as governor she would push for mandatory paid family leave for new mothers and fathers and for universal prekindergarten and make education her top priorityVignarajah 37 has said she is driven to run partly by the retirement early this year of US Sen Barbara A Mikulski (D-Md) which left all statewide elected offices in Maryland filled by men for the first time in many yearsA graduate of Yale University and Yale Law School Vignarajah lives in Gaithersburg and worked for Michelle Obama for a little more than two years after a stint as a senior adviser at the State Department She previously worked at a New York-based consulting firm and a Chicago-based law firm and has taught at Georgetown UniversityVignarajah who was nine months old when her family immigrated to the United States with green cards announced last month that she would join the packed field of Democrats vying to challenge the popular incumbent Gov Larry Hogan (R) in 2018Other declared candidates include Prince Georges County Executive  former NAACP president  Baltimore County Executive  state  entrepreneur  and Baltimore lawyer and former University System of Maryland Board of Regents chair  Policy consultant  is also weighing a bidThey say no man can beat Governor Hogan she said during her announcement Well Im no manShortly after Vignarajah said she would run  to news organizations including The Washington Post about her voter registration A review of records by The Post showed she was registered in both Maryland and the District in recent years had lived in both places and voted in the District from 2010 to 2014 but in Maryland in 2016Maryland law requires gubernatorial candidates to have lived and been registered to vote in the state for five years immediately preceding the election DC law prohibits people from registering to vote when they are registered elsewhereThe Maryland State Board of Elections has asked Attorney General Brian E Frosh (D) to weigh in on whether a person who registered in the state but later voted in another jurisdiction would be considered a registered Maryland voterMary Wagner voter-registration director for the elections board said the attorney generals office is unlikely to provide an answer before Vignarajah files paperwork with the state to enter the race The filing deadline for the June primary is Feb27Wagner said the board would have canceled Vignarajahs voter registration if DC officials had notified the state that she was also registered in the DistrictVignarajah did not take questions Tuesday and declined to comment on her eligibility for officeThe Trump administrations decision to  on Monday gave the event a suddenly high profile with protesters outside media inside and angry lawmakers and academics criticizing the moveThis type of political interference or scientific censorship  whatever you want to call it  is ill-advised and does a real disservice to the American public and public health Sen Jack Reed (D) Rhode Islands senior senator said at an opening news conference for the State of Narragansett Bay and Its Watershed event in Providence We can debate the issues We can have different viewpoints But we should all be able to objectively examine the data and look at the evidenceReed was joined Monday by the rest of the states congressional delegation all of them Democrats who took turns chastising the Environmental Protection Agency for instructing twoof its scientists and one contractor not to speak at the conference MondayThe elephant in the room is its almost impossible to imagine this sequence of events Rep David N Cicilline said at Mondays event calling the scientists involved deeply respected and the report itself thoroughlyvetted The idea that we would deny the American people information  good reliable facts and evidence to develop good public policy  is not only disappointing itsdangerousRepJim Langevin echoed that sentiment We have got to get beyond this point of stifling science of muzzling good science and speak to the facts as they are he said This shouldnt be about a Democratic or Republican issue Its about protecting the planetOutside a small group of protesters gathered wearing tape over their mouths and holding handmade signs Denial is not a policy read one Un-gag science read anotherThe EPA has offered little explanation for the decision to prevent the scientists from participating other than to say in a statement that they were allowed to attend the event but not present because it is not an EPA conferenceMondays conference marked the culmination of a three-year report on the status of Narragansett Bay New Englands largest estuary and the challenges it faces Climate change features as a significant factor in the500-page report which evaluates 24 aspects of the bay and its larger watershed But organizers said the broader point of Mondays official release of the report was to highlight the improved water quality of the bay in recent decades  a success story they say is due in large part to the states partnership with the EPA and its scientistsFor about six years the EPA has provided about $600000 annually for each of more than two dozen national estuaries including the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program the conferences hostThe programs director Tom Borden saidthat the head of the EPAs National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory Atlantic Ecology Division informed him Friday that the keynote speaker division research ecologist Autumn Oczkowski and another colleague in the lab Rose Martin would not be able to make presentations at the eventI was not given a clear reason why Borden said in an interview Sunday adding that his team had worked closely with several of the agencys scientists on protecting and restoring the bay Its a terrific partnership to have EPA working with usAn EPA contractor who had contributed to two chapters of the report Emily Shumchenia also was told not to speak at the event She and Martin were slated to take part in a panel titled The Present and Future Biological Implications of Climate ChangeThe estuary report which was subject to extensive peer review and public comment charts how Narragansett Bay is becoming cleaner but also faces such challenges as nutrient runoff and climate changeThe public complaints Monday came not only from lawmakers but also from those involved in the report and from veterans of the work of improving the quality of Narragansett BayThe irony is an effort to squelch the participation from EPA I think just highlights the importance of science as the basis for our work and commits us even more vigorously to promoting science said Janet Coit director of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental ManagementJohn King a University of Rhode Island oceanography professor who chairs the science advisory committee of the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program said the EPAs decision had unwisely politicized the science underlying Mondays report and that it would have been completely irresponsible not to examine the potential effects that climate change will have on the bayWhat Id say to [EPA] Administrator [Scott] Pruitt is our job is to inform policy Hopefully it becomes good policy King told the assembled crowd Let us do our job without fear of losing our jobs I hope in thatspirit we can move forward from what has occurredLess than two weeks before Donald Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination his campaign chairman offered to provide briefings on the race to a Russian billionaire closely aligned with the Kremlin according to people familiar with the discussionsPaul Manafort made the offer in an email to an overseas intermediary asking that a message be sent to Oleg Deripaska an aluminum magnate with whom Manafort had done business in the past these people saidIf he needs private briefings we can accommodate Manafort wrote in the July 7 2016 email portions of which were read to The Washington Post along with other Manafort correspondence from that timeThe emails are among tens of thousands of documents that have been turned over to congressional investigators and special counsel Robert S Mueller IIIs team as they probe whether Trump associates coordinated with Russia as part of Moscows efforts to interfere in the 2016 US electionThere is no evidence in the documents showing that Deripaska received Manaforts offer or that any briefings took place And a spokeswoman for Deripaska dismissed the email exchanges as scheming by consultants in the notorious beltway bandit industryNonetheless investigators believe that the exchanges which reflect Manaforts willingness to profit from his prominent role alongside Trump created a potential opening for Russian interests at the highest level of a US presidential campaign according to people familiar with the probe Those people like others interviewed for this story spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss matters under investigationSeveral of the exchanges which took place between Manafort and a Kiev-based employee of his international political consulting practice focused on money that Manafort believed he was owed by Eastern European clientsThe notes appear to be written in deliberately vague terms with Manafort and his longtime employee Konstantin Kilimnik never explicitly mentioning Deripaska by name But investigators believe that key passages refer to Deripaska who is referenced in some places by his initials OVD according to people familiar with the emails One email uses black caviar a Russian delicacy in what investigators believe is a veiled reference to payments Manafort hoped to receive from former clientsIn one April exchange days after Trump named Manafort as a campaign strategist Manafort referred to his positive press and growing reputation and asked How do we use to get whole Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni said Wednesday that the email exchanges reflected an innocuous effort to collect past debtsIts no secret Mr Manafort was owed money by past clients Maloni saidMaloni said that no briefings with Deripaska ever took place but that in his email Manafort was offering what would have been a routine briefing on the state of the campaignVera Kurochkina a spokeswoman for Rusal the company led by Deripaska on Wednesday derided inquiries from The Post that she said veer into manufactured questions so grossly false and insinuating that I am concerned even responding to these fake connotations provides them the patina of realityCollectively the thousands of emails present a complex picture For example an email exchange from May shows Manafort rejecting a proposal from an unpaid campaign adviser that Trump travel abroad to meet with top Russian leaders We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips Manafort wrote according to an email read to The PostThe email exchanges with Kilimnik add to an already perilous legal situation for Manafort whose real estate dealings and overseas bank accounts are of intense interest for Mueller and congressional investigators as part of their examination of Russias 2016 efforts People close to Manafort believe Muellers goal is to force the former campaign chairman to flip on his former Trump associates and provide informationIn August Muellers office executed a search warrant during an early-morning raid of Manaforts Alexandria Va condominium an unusually aggressive step in a white-collar criminal matterMueller has also summoned Maloni the Manafort spokesman and Manaforts former lawyer to answer questions in front of a grand jury Last month Muellers team told Manafort and his attorneys that they believed they could pursue criminal charges against him and urged him to cooperate in the probe by providing information about other members of the campaign The New York Times reported this week that prosecutors had threatened Manafort with indictmentThe emails now under review by investigators and described to The Post could provide prosecutors with additional leverage Kilimnik did not respond to requests for comment A spokesman for Mueller declined to commentDeripaska one of Russias richest men is widely seen as an important ally of President Vladimir Putin A US diplomatic cable from 2006 published by WikiLeaks referred to Deripaska as among the 2-3 oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basisThe billionaire has struggled to get visas to travel to the United States because of concerns he might have ties to organized crime in Russia according to the Wall Street Journal He has vigorously denied any criminal tiesRussian officials have frequently raised the visa matter over the years with US diplomats according to former US officials familiar with the appealsIn 2008 one of Manaforts business partners Rick Davis arranged for Deripaska to meet then-presidential candidate John McCain at an international economic conference in SwitzerlandAt the time Davis was on leave from Manaforts firm and was serving as McCains campaign manager The meeting caused a stir given McCains longtime criticism of Putins leadershipThe Post reported in 2008 that Deripaska jointly emailed Davis and Manafort after the meeting to thank them for setting it up Davis did not respond Wednesday to a request for commentAt the time of the McCain meeting Manafort was working in Ukraine advising a Russia-friendly political party He ultimately helped to elect Viktor Yanukovych as president in 2010 In 2014 Yanukovych was ousted from office during street protests and fled to MoscowManafort and Deripaska have both confirmed that they had a business relationship in which Manafort was paid as an investment consultant In 2014 Deripaska accused Manafort in a Cayman Islands court of taking nearly $19million intended for investments and then failing to account for the funds return them or respond to numerous inquiries about exactly how the money was used There are no signs in court documents that the case has been closed The emails under review by investigators also show that Manafort waved off questions within the campaign about his international dealings according to people familiar with the correspondenceManafort wrote in an April 2016 email to Trump press aide Hope Hicks that she should disregard a list of questions from The Post about his relationships with Deripaska and a Ukrainian businessman according to people familiar with the emailWhen another news organization asked questions in June Manafort wrote Hicks that he never had any ties to the Russian government according to people familiar with the emailHicks now the White House communications director declined to commentFormer campaign officials said that Manafort frequently told his campaign colleagues that assertions made about him by the press were specious They also privately shared concerns about whether Manafort was always putting the candidates interests firstThe emails turned over to investigators show that Manafort remained in regular contact with Kilimnik his longtime employee in Kiev throughout his five-month tenure at the Trump campaignKilimnik a Soviet army veteran had worked for Manafort in his Kiev political consulting operation since 2005 Kilimnik began as an office manager and translator and attained a larger role with Manafort working as a liaison to Deripaska and others people familiar with his work have saidPeople close to Manafort told The Post that he and Kilimnik used coded language as a precaution because they were transmitting sensitive information internationally In late July eight days after Trump delivered his GOP nomination acceptance speech in Cleveland Kilimnik wrote Manafort with an update according to people familiar with the email exchangeKilimnik wrote in the July 29 email that he had met that day with the person who gave you the biggest black caviar jar several years ago according to the people familiar with the exchange Kilimnik said it would take some time to discuss the long caviar story and the two agreed to meet in New YorkInvestigators believe that the reference to the pricey Russian luxury item may have been a reference to Manaforts past lucrative relationship with Deripaska according to people familiar with the probe Others familiar with the exchange say it may be a reference to Ukrainian business titans with whom Manafort had done business Kilimnik and Manafort have previously confirmed that they were in contact during the campaign including meeting twice in person  once in May 2016 as Manaforts role in Trumps campaign was expanding and again in August about two weeks before Manafort resigned amid questions about his work in UkraineThe August meeting is the one the two men arranged during the emails now under examination by investigatorsThat encounter took place at the Grand Havana Club an upscale cigar bar in Manhattan Kilimnik has said the two discussed unpaid bills and current news But he said the sessions were private visits that were in no way related to politics or the presidential campaign in the USMOSCOW An aluminum magnate whosurvivedthe gangster capitalismof the 1990s and the financial crisis of 2008 Oleg Deripaska is ashrewd self-made billionairewho hasmanaged to stay on the right side ofpower whether by marrying into the family ofRussias first president Boris Yeltsin or by making himself indispensable toits current one Vladimir PutinAs my Washington-based colleagues reported this week former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort allegedly offered to provide Deripaska 49 with  about the 2016 presidentialelection lessthan two weeks before Trump accepted the Republican nomination The emailed offer said to have been sent to a Russian colleague of Manaforts is among tens of thousands of documents that have been turned over to investigators  possible collusion between Trump associates and Russia as part of an effort by the Kremlin to interfere in the 2016 US election  It is unclear whether such an offer reached Deripaska and a spokesman for the businessman denied that it did But Manaforts apparent readiness to share information with an oligarch known to be part of a trusted circleof businessmen near Putin is one of the most concrete revelations to emerge from the probe into Trumps Russia linksDeripaskas relationship with Manafort began in the mid-2000s when Manafort was a consultant for a Ukraine-based oligarch Rinat Akhmetov an associate of oustedpresident Viktor Yanukovych The Associated Press in March that Manafort signed a $10 million annual contract with Deripaska in 2005 a report that Deripaska denied and later  against the AP In 2008 Rick Gates a partner of Manaforts wrote in a memo that Deripaska was considering partnering with the two men to buy the Drake Hotel in Manhattan By 2014 Deripaska had filed a petition in a Cayman Islands court accusing Manafort and Gates of taking $19 million intended for investment then failing to account for the funds or return themDeripaska nowabout $65 billion according to Forbes has always stayed close to power He married the daughter of Yeltsins chief of staff part of the family the coterie of influential advisers around Yeltsin Under Putin he survived near-bankruptcy to later invest more than $1 billionin Putins pet project the 2014 Sochi Olympics A Russian state bank helped Deripaska with billions in loans Russias foreign minister has lobbied to help him get a US visa and a 2006 US diplomatic cable disclosed by WikiLeakssaid he wasamong the 2-3 oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis and a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putins trips abroadAfter graduating from Moscow State University with a degree in nuclear physics Deripaska began his career as a metals trader in the mid-1990s before buying a stake in a Siberian aluminum smelter which eventually grew into the Sibirsky Aluminium Group The group now called Basic Element owns a 47 percent stake in Rusal one of the largest aluminum-producing companies in the world along with the hydroelectric power producer EuroSibEnergo the GAZ automotive group infrastructure construction companies and the Russian insurance company IngosstrakhThe metals business in 1990s Russia The two settled out of court in 2012 Deripaska alleged that Cherney was in league with another manAnton Malevsky who died mysteriouslyin a parachuting accident in South AfricaThe business also made Deripaska fantasticallywealthy In 2008 Forbes listed him as the richest man in Russia and the ninth-richest man in the world with a net worth of $28 billion By this timeDeripaska was meeting with a string of high-profile Western politicians  Deripaska helped sparka scandal in British politics in 2008 when it was revealed that he had hosted the Conservative Partys chief spokesman on finance George Osborne on his $150 million yacht in the Mediterraneanthat Deripaskas connections to Putin or at least the Russian government have been sufficiently closethat as recently as 2016 Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had lobbied on behalf of Deripaska for the United States to admit himDeripaskas business was blindsided by the financial crisis and collapse in commodity prices of 2008 and he was forced to refinance loans according to with support from the Kremlin In a $50 billion bailout thestate-run Vnesheconombank or VEB gave Deripaska one of the largest loans $45 billion to pay off foreign banks and avoid surrendering stakes in companies he had put up as collateral When a Financial Times reporter asked him in 2010 how close he had come to going out of business he replied Very closeThat also brought political trouble In 2009 workers in the town of Pikalevo (population 22000) began protesting after Deripaskas alumina refinery there halted production triggering layoffs and pay cutsThe protests attracted the attention of Putin who flew out personally to show that he was engaged in solving an economic crisis that was repeating itself across the country In a dressing-down of the factory owners later broadcastnationwidePutin berated Deripaska and forced him to sign a contract restarting the plant As Deripaska walked away Putin saidAnd give me back my penYet Deripaska rebounded surviving the financial crisis in large part thanks to generous government loans  By 2014 he was investing more than $1 billion in the Sochi Olympics includingbuilding theOlympic Village a 26-mile road around the Olympic venues and an expansion of the citys airport According to Russias Vedomosti newspaper Deripaska received an award from Putin for his investments in the OlympicsTwo of the Republican Partys highest-profile Latinos are stumping for Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie at a time when the Republican is fending off criticism from Latino and immigrant groups who blast his ads about MS-13 gang violence as US Sen Marco Rubio (R-Fla) will campaign for Gillespie in northern Virginia next Monday headlining a get-out-the-vote rally in Sterling a DC exurban town in swing Loudoun County The event is free and open to the public It will come days after New Mexico Gov Susana Martinez (R) the nations first elected Latina governor is scheduled Thursday to appear with Gillespie at business roundtables and a luncheon in northern VirginiaSenator Rubio and Governor Martinez are strong conservative leaders and I am thrilled to welcome each of them back to the Commonwealth in the closing weeks of this critically important election Gillespie said through a spokesman   Their appearances on the campaign trail come as Gillespie tries to lock-up support from Republicans moderates and independents in vote-rich northern Virginia where Democrats have sought to drive up margins of victory in order to win statewide Gillespie faces Democrat Ralph Northam on Nov 7 On Tuesday Latino groups announced they would air Spanish language radio ads in Virginia urging voters to support the Democratic ticket It is important for the Latino community to understand the major differences between the candidates said Julio Lainez state director for Americas Voice Virginia The hateful campaign being run by Gillespie and the Virginia Republican Party aims to divide VirginiansRubio carried northern Virginia counties in the 2016 Republican presidential primary though he narrowly lost the state to Donald Trump He has continued to be critical of the president  a divide that Democrats played up Gotta sting that Ed would rather campaign with Lil Marco than you @realDonaldTrump tweeted Northam press secretary Ofirah Yheskel referring to Trumps nickname for his former rival during the primary Trump of Gillespie but has not indicated any for him and Gillespie has been demurred when asked if he wants the president to stump for him in a state where his approval ratings are below 40 percent Vice President Pence a longtime friend of Gillespies joined the candidate for a  an area that voted overwhelmingly for Trump in November Northam meanwhile had former president  and former vice president  campaign with him in the last week US Sen Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nevada) the nations first Latina senator met with a small group of Latino students at George Mason University on Monday to plug Northams candidacySergey Kislyak Russias long-serving ambassador to the United States has a habit noticed by many US officials who have known the envoyKislyak shows up everywhere and tries to talk to everyoneHe doesnt get as much credit as he should in my view for being savvy about developing relationships with people all over the city said Michael McFaul who knew the diplomat well while serving in the Obama administration as senior adviser on Russia and then as US ambassador to RussiaMoscows man in Washington is an unlikely man of the political moment however He is quiet careful rumpled and portly He is a fierce defender of Russias international prestige who rarely gives interviews and even more rarely makes news on his own He is not considered especially close to Russian President Vladimir PutinFor Kislyak to have sought contacts with former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Attorney General Jeff Sessions in 2016 when the latter was a US senator should come as no surprise current and former US officials said  Flynn a retired Army lieutenant general and former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency was a top national security adviser and frequent warm-up act for Trump during the campaign He was forced out as national security adviser at the White House over concerns he had misled Vice President Pence and others about his contacts with Kislyak before Trump took officeSessions then a US senator from Alabama was among Trumps early supporters in Congress and went on television to promote the candidate He has  for two meetings with Kislyak last yearThe Russian diplomat who speaks excellent English seems to know American officials past and present across the political and ideological spectrum Several Americans who know him say he prides himself on proximity  he always seems to have just had dinner with someone influential or just happens to be seated up front at newsworthy foreign policy eventsJohn McLaughlin a former deputy CIA director and acting CIA director under Obama said that it does strain credibility that Sessions would have simply forgotten about his meetings with Kislyak when he asserted during his confirmation hearing to become attorney general that he had not met with Russian officialsI know Ambassador Kislyak Hes a veteran of Russian diplomacy and hes a hard guy to forget if youve met with him McLaughlin said during an interview Thursday with MSNBC host Andrea MitchellSessions said  that he was taken aback by a question  which referred to a breaking news story about contacts between Trump campaign surrogates and Russians In retrospect I should have slowed down and said I did meet one Russian official a couple times That would be the ambassador he saidKislyak arrived as ambassador in 2008 a few months before the start of the Obama administration and is expected to leave this spring His replacement has not been announcedThe Russian Embassy did not respond to a request for an interview with KislyakMost of the ambassadors outreach efforts focus on the executive branch as is the custom for Russian diplomats whose political system back home is top-downLawmakers are often reluctant to meet with senior Russian officials independently because diplomacy and intelligence gathering tend to blur for Moscows representatives in the United StatesStill the Sessions contacts on their own are of a piece with what foreign ambassadors and especially Kislyak see as a part of their job current and former US officials and Russia experts saidIt seems entirely routine for the ambassador of a foreign government to want to meet with senators for example and especially one who is a member of the Armed Services Committee said Paul Saunders a Russia specialist at the Center for the National Interest and a former official in the George W Bush administrationMost members of the Armed Services Committee however told The Post that they had not met with Kislyak last yearSaunderss group hosted then-candidate Donald Trump for a foreign policy speech in April last yearKislyak was in the audience as one of four invited foreign ambassadors as Trump proclaimed America-first will be the major and overriding theme of my administrationKislyak is known to collect scores of business cards as he moves around Washington and to follow up sometimes relentlessly with requests for one-on-one meetings Sessions said Thursday that Kislyak had also invited him to lunch an invitation he never took upHe was constantly doing that when I was in the government McFaul said of Kislyaks ability to speak to US officials at the Pentagon and elsewhere sometimes without the White House knowing about it first At times it would be frustrating to usKislyak a physicist and arms-control expert by training has succeeded as a diplomat by voicing the official Russian line on all issues in genial terms and within the hierarchy of Russian diplomacy by always having fresh news gossip and political analysis to feed back homeIt is not clear how much Kislyak knew about what US intelligence officials have said was a concerted Russian government effort to influence the US presidential election although it is likely that he was at least aware of it said Steven Hall former head of Russia operations at the CIAIn the case of Sessions who was considered a top prospect for a Cabinet job when Kislyak visited him in his Senate office in September Kislyak would have wanted to know How reasonable is he from a Russia perspective Hall saidKislyak denied that Russia was meddling in the election during an address to the Detroit Economic Club less than two weeks before the Nov8 electionWe have become kind of collateral damage in the fight between the two parties he said adding that Russia is ready to work with any president that is going to be electedOpinions differ on whether Kislyak is a spy in the American sense of the wordFor them its much grayer Hall said of the Russian view of the difference between a diplomat and spy I would say [Kislyak] is most definitely both In the Russian system its simply assumed that theyre all collecting and doing whatever they can either covertly or overtly Greg Miller and Julie Tate contributed to this reportThe director of national intelligence on Wednesday said officials had seen signs of attempted cyberattacks on 2016 presidential campaignsWeve already had some indications of that James R Clapper Jr said at a cyber-event at the Bipartisan Policy Center in WashingtonHe did not indicate whether the attempted intrusions were successful or whether they were by foreign or domestic hackers Nor did he specify whether the websites or campaign networks of Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders or Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump were targetedWere aware that campaigns and related organizations and individuals are targeted by actors with a variety of motivations  from philosophical differences to espionage  and capabilities  from defacements to intrusions said Brian P Hale director of public affairs for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence We defer to FBI for specific incidentsIn 2008 Chinese hackers compromised the computer networks of Sens Barack Obama (D-Ill) and John McCain (R-Ariz) In 2012 foreign and domestic hackers tried to gain access to the campaign networks of Obama and Mitt Romney (R)The US government and American businesses have become constant targets for hackers In 2013 federal agents  more than 3000 US companies that their computer systems had been hacked in the previous year The Pentagon reportedly sees millions of attempts a day Clapper said the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI are working to educate campaigns against potential cyberthreatsHe added I anticipate as the campaigns intensify well probably have more of those [attempts]A team of dinosaur specialists from the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History drove down a tree-lined road outside Toronto past a Carquest Auto Parts store and up to a gray aluminum-sided building that held a spectacle 65million years in the making Then they stepped inside and finally saw it the Nations T rex standing upright for the first time since the Cretaceous PeriodOne of them gasped Arms crossed another quietly circled the 12-foot-tall 35-foot-long skeleton A third  the one who almost always has something to say  could say nothing at allA rare moment dinosaur curator Matthew Carrano recalled that afternoon when Im not talkingIn what may be among the most dramatic fossil displays on earth the beast was posed looming over the fiberglass body of a triceratops collapsed on its side With one foot crushing into the horned herbivores ribs the s head  which is the size of a riding lawn mower  was bent down appearing as if a moment away from decapitating its preyDiscovered in Montana in 1988 the dinosaur had been exhibited in pieces until last year when the Smithsonian Institution took possession of the coveted fossil on a 50-year loan from its owner the Army Corps of Engineers   Last fall the animals bones were shipped to Ontarios Research Casting International a renowned firm of experts that has assembled dinosaurs for museums all over the worldThe Smithsonian team had imagined the ambitious presentation two years ago first through Carranos hand gestures then in pencil on sheets of paper then on computer screens then in a miniature 3-D model But none of that would matter if the real-life display didnt workFor one of the worlds most-visited museums the stakes couldnt be much higher The dinosaur has been given the grandiose title of the Nations T rex after all and it will serve as the gem of the Natural History Museums fossil hall when the  after a $48million renovationOne day the team knew this T rex may become the most viewed in historyThe blowtorch hissed as its blue flame licked a blackened section of the T rexs steel tailWith his colleague applying the heat Garth Dallman stood on a nearby ladder and stared through clear safety glasses at the glowing metal On the back of his tan T-shirt was the cartoon image of a blowtorch-wielding human skeleton riding the back of a T rex skeletonDallman and others from the casting company had worked through the weekend adding to the more than 4000 man hours they had spent on this project in preparation for Mondays big unveiling They had attached the T rexs rib-stomping foot just moments before the Smithsonian team arrived and by afternoon Dallman looked very much like a man who needed a nap His black-circled eyes were bloodshot and behind his ear was a pencil with an eraser rubbed down to the metal casingBut rest would have to wait because on Tuesday they were raising the tail five inches The museum wanted to be sure that its lowest point hung at least 10 feet off the ground to prevent visitors from reaching high enough to damage itBut no alteration could make the T rexs pose unrealistic Using a green laser pointer Carrano explained that the back tip shouldnt be raised higher than the baseGravity he saidThe casting crew arrived at 7am Tuesday to heat a section of the steel to 2100 degrees and shift it up That process caused one of the bolts that support a vertebrae to seize upAre they all stuck or just that one said Matt Fair a 25-year veteran of the company and its production managerJust that one Dallman told himWith the aid of an angle grinder and a drill a new bolt was soon installed and Dallman was on to the next challenge  The dinosaur is one of the most complete T rex skeletons ever unearthed with more than 130original pieces But that still required the casting firm to fabricate 96 others including the head because the real one is too fragile to exhibit Theyre all held together by more than 1000 feet of steel that pushes the total weight beyond 4000 poundsThe company is being paid $6million to assemble 52 Smithsonian specimens over the next four years (The T rex and other fossils will eventually be dismantled shipped back to Washington and reassembled at the Natural History Museum)At first glance the RCI crew members dont seem like the kind of people who stitch together ancient and delicate bones for the worlds most prestigious museums Voices subdued and personalities mellow they wear boots and jeans and flannel With hands coated in black they work beneath a clock that instead of numbers lists letters that spell GUINNESS TIMETheir even keels and mild senses of humor are in many ways ideal for this line of work which has no room for people who succumb to pressure handling priceless pieces of natural historyEach crew member must be part construction worker part sculptor part scientist part mechanic part anthropologist and part engineerDallman a gray-bearded master blacksmith with a background in museums designed more than 100 unique mounts (known as armatures) that attach to the frame and hold the bones in place using thin metal tentacles meant to integrate with the dinosaurs form Many are so elegant that they wouldnt look out of place on display at Washingtons National Gallery of ArtFair who also tends a farm of chickens and goats built a 23-foot gantry crane this summer with the help of his sons His yellow behemoth was used to hoist the T rexs 1200-pound hip into placeYou cant buy one that big said Fair who spent so much time prepping fossils in Washington for shipment to Canada that he still has a Giant grocery store card on his key chainPeter May the businesss owner studied sculpting in college and fell into the field after responding to a museums newspaper ad He founded the company in 1987 and has grown it into a firm of 20 employees who work with clients as far away as Germany Japan and AustraliaFor May 60 his day job stopped feeling surreal long ago but few things give him more pleasure than when a stranger asks what he does for a living He grins through his salt-and-pepper goatee and says simply I build dinosaursSteve Jabo cut a slab of cardboard with a box cutter then used duct tape to attach his tracing of what looked like a crocodile skeletonIts very low tech said Jabo a Smithsonian fossil preparator He and his colleagues had come to Canada not just to gawk

Siobhan Starrs and Pauline Dolovich a Toronto-based designer who is helping to plan the layoutWheres champsy going to go Jabo saidStarrs and Dolovich needed a minute The pair had spent much of the prior 36 hours consulting a book of designs thicker than a dictionaryThis is two volumes Dolovich said later of nineMost buildings are designed by the foot but not the fossil hall Its being designed by the  which means that 45million presentation decisions have to be made  and thats counting only the floor spaceIn the District three weeks earlier museum director Kirk Johnson stood in the empty hall and detailed its future his voice echoing through an expanse that felt far more like a tomb than it ever had when it was filled with dead animals Lights flickered yellow caution tape hung from columns and sections of walls were gashed as if an actual T rex had chomped into themLike clearing plaque from an artery the museums staffers will dismantle decades of incremental additions and clutter Many of the 2400 now-removed specimens also wont be brought back as the space  once dubbed the Hall of Extinct Monsters  returns to its 1910 design a much more open layout that will be partly lit by sunshine  Though the museums attendance is only slightly behind last years pace of 73million visitors Johnson had once hoped that the renovation wouldnt require five years He now knows that it will take every bit of it and in Canada the museums team seemed acutely aware of the time crunchThey settled on a spot for the champsosaurus and its companions They discussed how to depict the triceratops cast deciding that its frill could have puncture wounds but no claw marks because Carrano had never seen such a wound on an actual fossil They debated how high they should place the tail of what will be the T rexs neighbor an edmontosaurus that the cast companys technicians had found was covered in part by a 1903 copy of The Washington Post (BUY A HOME In Washingtons Most Popular

to his answerAnd as the afternoon waned and the museum teams flight back to DC approached Starrs sat cross-legged on the floor jotting down notes with her back to the Smithsonians most important dinosaurShe paused and looked upIt gives me goose bumps literally to think about how many children and their children and grandchildren will remember the moment she said pointing over her shoulder And the moment is in front of the T rexThen Starrs stood brushed the brown dirt off of her jeans and got back to work because 2019 isnt as far away as it soundsA Ukrainian lawmaker released new financial documents Tuesday allegedly showing that a former campaign chairman for President Trump laundered payments from the party of a disgraced ex-leader of Ukraine using offshore accounts in Belize and Kyrgyzstan The new documents if legitimate stem from business ties between the Trump aide Paul Manafort and the party of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych who enjoyed Moscows backing while he was in power He has been in hiding in Russia since being overthrown by pro-Western protesters in 2014 and is wanted in Ukraine on corruption chargesThe latest documents were released just hours after the House Intelligence Committee questioned FBI Director James B Comey about possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow The hearing that also touched on Manaforts work for Yanukovychs party in UkraineComey declined to say whether the FBI is coordinating with Ukraine on an investigation of the alleged payments to Manafort  Manafort who worked for Yanukovychs Party of Regions for nearly a decade resigned from Trumps campaign in August after his name surfaced in connection with secret payments totaling $127million by Yanukovychs party Manafort has denied receiving those listed in the partys black ledger Serhiy Leshchenko a lawmaker and journalist released a copy of an invoice on letterhead from Manaforts consulting company based in Alexandria Va dated Oct 14 2009 to a Belize-based company for $750000 for the sale of 501 computersOn the same day Manaforts name is listed next to a $750000 entry in the black ledger which was considered a party slush fund The list was found at the party headquarters in the turmoil after Ukraines 2014 revolution The ledger entries about Manafort were released by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine a government law enforcement agency last AugustLeshchenko alleges that Manafort falsified an invoice to the Belize company to legitimize the $750000 payment to himselfI have found during this investigation that [Manafort] used offshore jurisdictions and falsified invoices to get money from the corrupt Ukrainian leader Leshchenko said during a news conference in downtown Kiev where he provided a copy of the invoice to journalists  He said he received the invoices and other documents in January from the new tenants of Manaforts former offices in downtown Kiev The documents were left behind in a safe he said adding that Manaforts signature and his company seal were proof that the documents were authenticLeshchenko said he was not aware of any formal Ukrainian investigation of the documents He declined to comment on whether he had discussed the documents with US law enforcement agenciesNazar Kholodnytskyi a deputy prosecutor general of Ukraine whose department specializes in corruption cases said in an interview on Tuesday that the documents hadnt been confirmed by law enforcement or to his knowledge submitted for examination There is an ongoing investigation into the black ledgers he said but Manafort was not a target of that investigation  Manafort has previously accused Leshchenko of blackmailing him by threatening to release harmful information about his financial relationshipwith Yanukovych That correspondence between Leshchenko and Manaforts daughter was released in February as the result of a purported cyberhack Leshchenko has called the exchange a forgeryManafort was involved in crafting the political strategy that brought Yanukovych to power after a crushing defeat in the 2004 elections Yanukovychs party has been accused of ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin particularly through wealthy oligarchs from the countrys east with interests in both Russia and UkraineVirginia Democrat Ralph Northam is airing a new statewide commercial in the final days of the governors race in which he calls negative ads from his Republican opponent despicable After weeks of advertising from Republican Ed Gillespie that sought to tie Northam first to MS-13 gang violence and then to a child pornographer Northams new commercial blasts them as false attacks Since September Gillespie has been airing a controversial commercial  that appears to have been viewed by both President Trump and former president Barack Obama  that suggests Northam is responsible for an increased the threat of  Media fact-checkers have found those claims falseNorthams new ad slams it as  while highlighting his background as an Army doctor and pediatrician and touts he helped pass tougher penalties for gang members and violent sexual predators as a state senatorIm a pediatrician and for Ed Gillespie to say I would tolerate anyone hurting a child is despicable Northam says to the camera   Thats a reference to Gillespies criticizing Northam for supporting Democratic Gov Terry McAuliffes restoration of voting rights to felons who completed their sentences including a suspected child pornographer In campaign ads airing this week Gillespie highlights the case of John Bowen  who was convicted in 2001 of aggravated sexual battery and indecent liberties with a minor His voting rights were briefly restored two months after he was arrested but not convicted on suspicion of having a large trove of child pornography He lost his voting rights again in January when he pleaded guilty to the pornography charges McAuliffe who cannot seek consecutive terms defended the restoration of felon rights saying its the same system that exists in 40 other states Gillespies ads also say the restoration of voting rights made it easier for felons to get a gun Felons still needed a judges approval to legally obtain firearms  Dave Abrams a spokesman for Gillespie said Northams response ad does not dispute any specific facts He apparently cannot refute any of it said Abrams And these issues matter The war over the airwaves comes as Election Day looms on Nov 7 The race has taken a nasty turn and Democrats have sent out a mailer that who marched over the summer in Charlottesville Quentin Kidd a pollster and political scientist at Christopher Newport University said he sees Northam heeding the lessons of not letting attacks go unansweredIts largely akin to trench warfare Kidd said The Northam campaigns full-throated response is essentially a full-throated defense of the small lead that they haveMost public polls show Gillespie and Northam tied or Northam with a slight leadWhile Northams ad hits Gillespie for dubious facts in his ads about gang violence it also contained a factual error The commercials says he helped pass legislation strengthening gang penalties but the bill cited on the screen did not passA spokesman for Northam said the ad will be corrected to reflect different legislation that Northam supported and became lawThe cries began shortly before 5 am echoing down the almost empty corridors of United Medical Centers nursing home From his bed in Room 704 Warren Webbs moans cohered into words Help I cant breathe A registered nurse appeared and adjusted the height of his bed But the nurse quickly began arguing with Webbs wheelchair-bound roommate who was pleading for her to do more to help Webb rolled out of bed and landed on the floor his diaper coming looseWebb a 47-year-old AIDS patient would lie on the floor in his own waste for approximately 20 minutes while his nurse quarreled with his roommate and then conversed with a security guard When he was finally lifted back into bed his caregivers could not find a pulse Just after 6am he was pronounced deadWebbs death on Aug 25 reconstructed through a time-stamped audio recording of the incident obtained by The Washington Post and interviews with three eyewitnesses is the latest in a string of troubling incidents at the Districts only public hospital  UMC staff members do not appear to have followed what medical experts described as basic and potentially lifesaving protocols in their treatment of Webb immediately before his death In the aftermath hospital officials fired one of the nurses involved but failed to report details of Webbs case to regulators that would have triggered an outside investigation Webbs relatives say hospital staff members misled them about the events that preceded his deathA spokeswoman for the DC Health Department said that the nursing home had filed an incident report concerning Webb  who according to his death certificate died after a heart attack  but that the report did not contain any information that pointed towards injury neglect or abuseAfter learning new details about Webbs death from The Post the Health Department is launching an investigation spokeswoman Jasmine Gossett saidThe Joint Commission an accreditation body that visited UMC in September was not aware of any patient-safety concerns related to Webbs death a spokeswoman said She said the commission would now review the incidentHospital officials declined to answer detailed questions about Webbs case but issued a statement asserting that the incident was handled properlyThe matter was investigated and based on the findings appropriate actions were taken the statement reads Timely notification to the appropriate regulatory and licensing bodies was provided and they are conducting their respective investigations Due to resident/patient and employee privacy regulations as well as the other ongoing investigations we are not at liberty to discuss the matter further However we continue to cooperate fullyQuestions about Webbs death come as DC elected officials are intensifying their oversight of UMC which is struggling with deteriorating finances and growing concerns about patient safety Since last year the city has been paying a politically connected consulting firm Veritas of Washington $300000 a month to run the hospitalVincent Gray a Ward 7 Democrat and chairman of the DC Councils health committee plans to hold a hearing Monday on whether UMC needs new management  The citys largest medical facility east of the Anacostia River UMC has for decades drifted in and out of financial turmoil while serving its poor and predominantly African American patients in Southeast Washington and Prince Georges County MdOn Aug 7 regulators closed the hospitals nursery and delivery rooms after discovering dangerous medical errors in the treatment of pregnant women and newborns   The Post reported last month that the consultants managing UMC had delivered about a tenth of the $9 million in extra revenue they had promised to generate even while collecting $5 million in taxpayer dollars  Webbs treatment and the handling of his death could revive allegations that have dogged hospital officials in recent months that UMC staff is sometimes dismissive of or disrespectful toward patients and that hospital supervisors are slow to acknowledge and correct mistakesWebbs father Baye Webb a 71-year-old resident of Lanham Md said nurses did not disclose key details when they explained his sons death such as his repeated cries for help or the extended period when he was left on the floor of his roomWe totally felt like they were misleading us and the facts werent forthcoming he said Of the new information about his sons death he said simply Its agonizingWarren Webb was born in the District and  although he spent some of his teenage years in South Carolina and as an adult lived in Georgia  always considered Washington his home A cinephile who organized movie nights at his apartment complex in Southeast Washington he jokingly called his mother Mommie Dearest a reference to the 1981 film that depicts actress Joan Crawfords tortured relationship with her daughterThat sense of humor helped him weather difficult stretches in his life including his HIV infection his diagnosis with a form of bipolar disorder and a period when he used crack cocaine said his mother Tujuana Bigelow a resident of Glenarden Md In late July he was admitted to UMCs skilled nursing facility for rehabilitation after being diagnosed with a brain mass that caused strokelike symptomsBigelow a 66-year-old Prince Georges County school bus driver said she visited her son almost every day She quickly became alarmed by what she saw as his nurses inattentiveness When her son was admitted she said he could still walk to the bathroom At UMC they immediately put him in diapers She said his nurses were slow to respond to the call button in his room and would sometimes leave him in a soiled diaper for hours on endNobody helped Nobody cared It was so sad Bigelow said After being notified of their sons death on the morning of Aug 25 Webbs parents met with his caregivers at the UMC nursing home Bigelow said they gave a halting explanation of what had happened A nurse recounted that she slid him to the floor to clean him up after he had a bowel movement and then sent him to the emergency room when she noticed that he wasnt breathingWhat they were saying didnt make any sense to me Bigelow said Why would you take a patient out of the bed and put him on the floor to change himBigelow said she suspected hospital officials were withholding information You could see it the way they were stumbling every time I asked a question she said Several hours earlier Webbs 58-year-old roommate Gregory Gary rolled up in his wheelchair to the nursing station on the hospitals seventh floorAt the nursing station Gary asked Peter Offor a licensed practical nurse if he could send someone to change Webbs diaper In an Aug 31 written statement describing the incident to hospital officials Offor said he sent Webbs charge nurse to the patients room In an interview Offor identified the charge nurse as Christiana Ekwue Gary said in an interview that when he returned to the room the charge nurse was there and Webb who had become contorted on his bed was complaining that he couldnt breathe and calling for help to sit upGary said the nurse pushed a button that dropped Webbs mechanical hospital bed to its lowest setting Webb then rolled off the bed onto the floor with all the mess and stuff all over Gary said She didnt give him any assistance to try to better the situation She didnt make no attempt to help him sit up to where it would allow him to breathe betterEkwue repeatedly declined to discuss Webbs death when reached by telephone but confirmed that she is still employed at UMCIn the recording obtained by The Post Webb can be heard crying out at least 25 times during a three-minute period that begins just before the nurse enters his room Many of his cries are inchoate but he clearly gasps out his complaintI cant breathe Webb says Help me up PleaseIn the recording Gary also urges the nurse to help Webb He cant hardly breathe Gary says His pleading grows more urgent as Webb rolls out of his bed You aint helping him Gary says You aint doing s--- Mind your business Ekwue says on the tapeMary Uwemedimo a certified nursing assistant entered Webbs room shortly after Ekwue She said in an interview that when she arrived Webb was lying on the floor and that she placed some linens around him to soak up the urine and feces from his loosened diaperI was shocked to see him lying on the floor said Uwemedimo who later resigned for reasons she said were unrelated to Webbs case She said the charge nurse told her she had lowered the bed so Webb wouldnt hurt himself if he fell off A security guard arrived  it is unclear whether he was making routine rounds or responding to a call about the argument  and spoke to Gary about his alleged hostility toward the nurse He then spent several minutes at the nursing station talking with Ekwue and OfforAbout 510 am Ekwue can be heard asking for help at the nursing station to lift Webb off the floor Offor said in an interview that when he entered the room Webb did not appear to be in distress but that after they lifted him back into bed they could not find his pulseAbout 523 am Offor can be heard in the recording calling for a crash cart a mobile stand that carries emergency lifesaving equipment Offor and Uwemedimo said a night supervisor was called In the recording the supervisor  who is not identified  can be heard entering the room about 526 am asking what happened and demanding a stretcher so Webb could be moved to the hospitals emergency room A delay ensues however as Uwemedimo returns almost two minutes later and says she cannot find a stretcher Get one downstairs the supervisor orders in the recordingUwemedimo told The Post that the stretcher usually kept on the seventh floor of the hospital was not in its normal place and that she believed nurses from another floor had taken it She said she went downstairs got a stretcher and returned with it to Webbs roomWebb was pronounced dead in the emergency room at 601 am His cause of death a heart attackDeath certificates for low-income nursing home residents are notoriously imprecise said Jonathan Evans a Charlottesville specialist in geriatric medicine and past president of the American Medical Directors AssociationBut if the principal listed cause of death for Webb  myocardial infarction commonly called a heart attack  is correct leaving him on the floor for an extended period could have affected his chances of survival Evans saidIf he had a heart attack that time delay could have had a significant impact on whether he lived or not he saidTammy Slater an acute-care nurse practitioner and instructor at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing said a complaint of shortness of breath from a nursing-home patient should trigger an immediate physical assessment including measurements of heart rate respiration rate blood pressure and blood-oxygen saturationA quick fast assessment  Im talking minutes  should occur because this patient could be having a life-altering scenario Slater said Trouble breathing could be a sign of two potentially deadly conditions that require immediate treatment Slater said a heart attack or pulmonary embolism In both situations she said minutes countSlater said a patient rolling out of bed onto the floor  even if only a short distance  should also have been treated as a fall and triggered a prompt assessment for injuriesIt remains unclear what steps hospital officials took to investigate after Webbs death Uwemedimo said her supervisor asked her to provide a written statement about what happened on the morning Webb died but that nobody has interviewed herOffor was fired after Webbs death In a September letter explaining Offors termination that was obtained by The Post nursing home administrator Stephen Gbenle wrote that Warren Webb was yelling for help saying I cant breathe and that Offor did not get up from his seat to assist the resident UMC Chief Nursing Officer Maribel Torres also filed a complaint against Offor with the Districts nursing board It is unclear why Offor  who was the first person to realize the seriousness of his condition and attempt to save his life  was targeted for punishment Offor said that hospital officials refused to carry out the corporate investigation of Webbs death that should have been performed and that nobody interviewed him about what happened before he was approached by The PostGary left UMC in October to move into an apartment in Southeast Washington He said that Gbenle approached him about a week after Webbs death to discuss the incident but that he wasnt feeling well and asked him to come back later No one ever followed up he saidYou have some people who come here thats compassionate about their job Gary said of the UMC nursing home And you have a lot of them come here thats not Julie Tate and Daniel Mich contributed to this reportThe CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency rather than just to  according to officials briefed on the matterIntelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of  from the Democratic National Committee and others including Hillary Clintons campaign chairman according to US officials Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clintons chances  It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russias goal here was to favor one candidate over the other to help Trump get elected said a senior US official briefed on an intelligence presentation made to US senators Thats the consensus view  The Obama administration has been debating for months how to respond to the alleged Russian intrusions with White House officials concerned about escalating tensions with Moscow and being accused of trying to boost Clintons campaignIn September during a secret briefing for congressional leaders Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) voiced doubts about the veracity of the intelligence according to officials presentThe Trump transition team dismissed the findings in a short statement issued Friday evening These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history Its now time to move on and Make America Great Again the statement read Trump has consistently dismissed the intelligence communitys findings about Russian hackingI dont believe they interfered in the election he told Time magazine this week The hacking he said could be Russia And it could be China And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey  The CIA shared its latest assessment with key senators in a closed-door briefing on Capitol Hill last week in which agency officials cited a growing body of intelligence from multiple sources Agency briefers told the senators it was now quite clear that electing Trump was Russias goal according to the officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence mattersThe CIA presentation to senators about Russias intentions fell short of a formal US assessment produced by all 17 intelligence agencies A senior US official said there were minor disagreements among intelligence officials about the agencys assessment in part because some questions remain unansweredFor example intelligence agencies do not have specific intelligence showing officials in the Kremlin directing the identified individuals to pass the Democratic emails to WikiLeaks a second senior US official said Those actors according to the official were one step removed from the Russian government rather than government employees Moscow has in the past used middlemen to participate in sensitive intelligence operations so it has plausible deniabilityJulian Assange the founder of WikiLeaks has said  that the Russian government is not the sourceThe White House and CIA officials declined to commentOn Friday the White House said President Obama had ordered a full review of Russian hacking during the election campaign as pressure from Congress has grown for greater public understanding of exactly what Moscow did to influence the electoral processWe may have crossed into a new threshold and it is incumbent upon us to take stock of that to review to conduct some after-action to understand what has happened and to impart some lessons learned Obamas counterterrorism and homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science MonitorObama wants the report before he leaves office Jan20 Monaco said The review will be led by James Clapper the outgoing director of national intelligence officials saidDuring her remarks Monaco didnt address the latest CIA assessment which hasnt been previously disclosed  last week asked Obama to declassify details about the intrusions and why officials believe that the Kremlin was behind the operation Officials said Friday that the senators specifically were asking the White House to release portions of the CIAs presentationThis week top Democratic lawmakers in the House also  to Obama asking for briefings on Russian interference in the electionUS intelligence agencies have been cautious for months in characterizing Russias motivations reflecting the United States long-standing struggle to collect reliable intelligence on President Vladimir Putin and those closest to himIn previous assessments the CIA and other intelligence agencies told the White House and congressional leaders that they believed Moscows aim was to undermine confidence in the US electoral system The assessments stopped short of saying the goal was to help elect TrumpOn Oct7 the  of seeking to interfere in the election through the hacking of political organizations Though the statement never specified which party it was clear that officials were referring to cyber-intrusions into the and other Democratic groups and individualsSome key Republican lawmakers have continued to question the quality of evidence supporting Russian involvementIll be the first one to come out and point at Russia if theres clear evidence but there is no clear evidence  even now said Rep Devin Nunes (R-Calif) the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the Trump transition team Theres a lot of innuendo lots of circumstantial evidence thats it  Though Russia has long conducted cyberspying on US agencies companies and organizations this presidential campaign marks the first time Moscow has attempted through cyber-means to interfere in if not actively influence the outcome of an election the officials saidThe reluctance of the Obama White House to respond to the alleged Russian intrusions before Election Day upset Democrats on the Hill as well as members of the Clinton campaignWithin the administration top officials from different agencies sparred over whether and how to respond White House officials were concerned that covert retaliatory measures might risk an escalation in which Russia with sophisticated cyber-capabilities might have less to lose than the United States with its vast and vulnerable digital infrastructureThe White Houses reluctance to take that risk left Washington weighing more-limited measures including the naming and shaming approach of publicly blaming MoscowBy mid-September White House officials had decided it was time to take that step but they worried that doing so unilaterally and without bipartisan congressional backing just weeks before the election would make Obama vulnerable to charges that he was using intelligence for political purposesInstead officials devised a plan to seek bipartisan support from top lawmakers and set up a secret meeting with the Gang of 12  a group that includes House and Senate leaders as well as the chairmen and ranking members of both chambers committees on intelligence and homeland securityObama dispatched Monaco FBI Director James B Comey and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to make the pitch for a show of solidarity and bipartisan unity against Russian interference in the election according to a senior administration officialSpecifically the White House wanted congressional leaders to sign off on a bipartisan statement urging state and local officials to take federal help in protecting their voting-registration and balloting machines from Russian cyber-intrusionsThough US intelligence agencies were skeptical that hackers would be able to manipulate the election results in a systematic way the White House feared that Russia would attempt to do so sowing doubt about the fundamental mechanisms of democracy and potentially forcing a more dangerous confrontation between Washington and Moscow  In a secure room in the Capitol used for briefings involving classified information administration officials broadly laid out the evidence US spy agencies had collected showing Russias role in cyber-intrusions in at least two states and in hacking the emails of the Democratic organizations and individualsAnd they made a case for a united bipartisan front in response to what one official described as the threat posed by unprecedented meddling by a foreign power in our election processThe Democratic leaders in the room unanimously agreed on the need to take the threat seriously Republicans however were divided with at least two GOP lawmakers reluctant to accede to the White House requestsAccording to several officials McConnell raised doubts about the underlying intelligence and made clear to the administration that he would consider any effort by the White House to challenge the Russians publicly an act of partisan politicsSome of the Republicans in the briefing also seemed opposed to the idea of going public with such explosive allegations in the final stages of an election a move that they argued would only rattle public confidence and play into Moscows handsMcConnells office did not respond to a request for comment After the election Trump chose McConnells wife Elaine Chao as his nominee for transportation secretarySome Clinton supporters saw the White Houses reluctance to act without bipartisan support as further evidence of an excessive caution in facing adversariesThe lack of an administration response on the Russian hacking cannot be attributed to Congress said Rep Adam B Schiff (Calif) the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee who was at the September meeting The administration has all the tools it needs to respond They have the ability to impose sanctions They have the ability to take clandestine means The administration has decided not to utilize them in a way that would deter the Russians and I think thats a problem Philip Rucker contributed to this reportPresident Trump  to removing Confederate statues from public places saying it was sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monumentsThat appeal to history and culture echoes arguments made by neo-Confederate groups whocouch claimsabout the meaning of statues and other Confederate symbols in terms of heritage and other supposedly fundamental values that modern Americans are seen to have abandonedMost mainstream historians note on the other hand that  Most of them were erected between 1895 and World War I part of a campaign to paint the Southern cause in the Civil War as just and slavery as a benevolent institution Most monuments were created during the Jim Crow era to stand in opposition to racial equality  formerly the Atlanta Historical Society Veneration of Confederates symbolized white racial dominanceBut the president is not a historian and neither are most members of the American public A  found that by more than 2to1 Americans believe that Confederate monuments are symbols of Southern pride rather than of white supremacyWhites (66 percent) Republicans (84 percent) and Americans over age 65 (71 percent) are especially likely to say that Confederate monuments represent pride rather than supremacy Liberals (54 percent) Hillary Clinton voters (52 percent) and black Americans (47 percent) are the groups most likely to say that the monuments stand for white supremacySimilara plurality of Americans (48 percent) say they disapprove of the decision to remove the statue of Confederate general Robert E Lee from Charlottesville  the decision that sparked the violent rally by neo-Nazis and white supremacists last weekend Only 30 percent say they approve of the decision  In his remarks about the monuments the president may be making a calculatedattempt to motivate the approval of voters like the ones identified in the Economist/YouGov survey who arent sold on the idea that monuments to the Confederacy are monuments to racismThe presidents chief strategist Stephen K Bannon in an interview with the New York Times this week Just give me more Bannon saidTear down more statues Say the revolution is coming I cant get enough of itBut that calculation could backfire Trump remains a historically unpopular president with Given that unpopularity taking a strong stand in favor of Confederate monuments could simply motivate public opinion in opposition to themWeve seen Trumps  in action many times before on a variety of issues  Obamacare transgender troops the border wall the Mueller investigationIts almost as if the best way to make something popular is for President Trump to take the opposite position The Washington Posts Aaron Blake By taking a strong stand in support of Confederate monuments Trump may ironically end up ushering in their removalIn calling for an investigation into the veracity of Attorney General Jeff Sessionss comments to Congress Pelosi claimed Congress impeached former president Bill Clinton for something far less than what Sessions had doneSessions spoke twice in 2016 with Russias ambassador to the United States  but did not disclose this detail during his Senate confirmation hearing as attorney general when asked about possible contacts between the Russian government and President Trumps campaign In a separate written questionnaire Sessions denied being in contact with any part of the Russian government about the 2016 electionSo is it really the case that former president Bill Clinton was impeached for something so far less than SessionsDrew Hammill Pelosis deputy chief of staff said Clintons actions involved personal matters while Sessionss actions involve matters of state Pelosi has a point While the two cases involve statements made under oath the subject matters are vastly differentClinton gave misleading testimony in a private lawsuit filed by former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones and his perjurious statements were about his affair with Monica Lewinsky not the plaintiffSessions gave potentially misleading testimony in a public Senate hearing about Russian involvement in US presidential elections  an issue much more germane to national security than Clintons sex life But we dont know yet whether Sessions perjured himselfLets review the two cases found 11 possible grounds for Clintons impeachment all having to do with Clintons false statements under oath about his sexual activitieswith LewinskyClinton was accused of repeatedly lying under oath to a grand jury in his civil deposition and even to his own lawyer investigators found Clinton abused his constitutional authority by lying to the public and Congress throughout 1998 and tried to obstruct justice investigators foundFrom the Starr reportThere is substantial and credible information that the Presidents lies about his relationship with Ms Lewinsky were abundant and calculating according to investigators Lewinsky testified that she and Clinton engaged in sexual relations and there was a DNA sample to support her testimonyIn December 1998 the  accusing Clinton of perjury and of obstruction of justice Then in February 1999 the  of both charges Five Republicans and all 45 Democrats supported full acquittalAs a senator Sessions voted to convict Clinton on both charges  It is crucial to our system of justice that we demand the truth I fear that an acquittal of this President will weaken the legal system by providing an option for those who consider being less than truthful in courtNow heres what we know about Sessions and his statements to Congress so farSessions was not asked whether he as a campaign surrogate communicated with the Russian government Franken asked what Sessions would do if the CNN report turned out to be trueand there was any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government Sessions says in general that he is not aware of such communications Then he gives a caveat that he was called to be a surrogate and did not have communications with RussiaIn a  Sen Patrick J Leahy (D-Vt) asked Sessions Several of the President-elects nominees or senior advisers have Russian ties Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election either before or after election daySessions responded NoThe Post found however that Sessions met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on at least two occasions Once was after an event on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention in July 2016 and the other was a private meetingwith KislyakAfter the event at RNC a small group of ambassadors (including Kislyak) approached Sessions The Post reported Sessions then spoke individually to some of the ambassadors including Kislyak the official said In the informal exchanges the ambassadors expressed appreciation for his remarks and some of them invited him to events they were sponsoring said the official citing a former Sessions staffer who was at the eventSessionss spokeswoman told The Post that Sessions did not consider his conversations relevant to the senators questions He was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign  not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services CommitteeHis spokeswoman also characterized Sessionss September conversation with Kislyak as one of more than 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee Officials also said Sessions did not remember in detail what he discussed with Kislyak in the private meetingSo did Sessions intentionally mislead senators by saying he as a campaign surrogate did not communicate with Russia Or was he simply saying he was unaware of evidence to support CNNs report Why didnt Sessions disclose to Franken or Leahy that he had spoken twice to the Russian ambassador during the campaign in his capacity as a member of the Armed Services Committee It remains unclearClinton was acquitted by the Senate after a defense stating that he did not commit perjury as his statements involved inconsistencies and he couldnt be liable for perjury Sessionss statements to the Senate Judiciary Committee could not be clearer Hammill saidThe details about Sessionss interactions with Kislyak are still unfolding and his explanations about his misleading answers to Franken and Leahy are murky However in the context of Frankens question about members affiliated with the Trump campaign communicating with the Russian government it is unclear whether Sessions was intentionally making a false statementWhile the Sessions and Clinton cases both involve statements made under oath the circumstances are vastly different (Pelosi may be better off comparing Sessionss case  former acting attorney generalin 1972) If one were to weigh Pelosis claim based on whether Sessions and Clinton lied under oath its clear Clintons case is not far less than SessionssBut the content of Clintons lies (his sex life) was far less important than the content of Sessionss statements (about potential foreign influence in US elections) Pelosis staff indicated that she was making a distinction between the content of their statementsStill its too early to jump to such conclusions and make such an extremestatement Pelosi earns Two Pinocchios()How would you rate this claim (The check mark means you think the statement is true not that you agree with the rating)We

first develop a study and implementation plan as directed by the president in a memorandum released Friday Soon-to-be arriving political appointees at the Defense Department will play an important role in this effort Mattis added The plan will address both the potential for transgender people looking to serve in the military for the first time and transgender troops who already are servingOur focus must always be on what is best for the militarys combat effectiveness leading to victory on the battlefield Mattis said To that end I will establish a panel of experts serving within the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security to provide advice and recommendations on the implementation of the presidents directionMattis added that panel members will bring mature experience most notably in combat and deployed operations and seasoned judgment to this task The panel will assemble and thoroughly analyze all pertinent data quantifiable and non-quantifiableThe Pentagon chief said that afterthe panel makes its recommendations and he consults with the secretary of homeland security he will provide his advice to Trump In the meantime policy regarding transgender service members will remain in place Mattis said meaning that those serving can continue to do soOn Friday evening the White House announced that it was moving forward with Trumps transgender ban as Hurricane Harvey roared toward Texas  that he wanted the Pentagon to return to the long-standing policy and practice on military service by transgender individuals that was in place prior to June 2016 until such time as a sufficient basis exists to conclude that allowing them to service will not have negative effectsThe memorandum gave Mattis until Feb 1 to present a plan to Trump on how to implement the transgender ban and what to do with transgender service members already serving Those marked some of the first details the White House provided on how to carry out Trumps decision which initially took many Pentagon officials by surprise when the president announced it on Twitter on July 26After consultation with my Generals and military experts please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the US Military he said in three successive tweets Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail Thank youAfter consultation with my Generals and military experts please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the US Military Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail Thank you Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Gen Joseph F Dunford Jr the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff added the following day that transgender service members already serving will be treated with dignity and respect as the Pentagon sorts out its new policy but that it would carry out Trumps directive once it received guidance on how to do soMattis left the door open to some transgender service members continuing to serve during an exchange with reporters at the Pentagon this month The defense secretary asked Aug 14 if current service members would be ousted pointed to Dunfords directiveThe chairman immediately went out and said immediately Everyone stand fast until we get the direction  Mattis said I understand that this is probably more about your suspicion about what could be coming but the fact is we have received no direction that would indicate any harm to anybody right nowThe Obama administration repealed its ban on transgender service member serving in July 2016 A Rand Corp study commissioned by the Pentagon found that there were between 2500 and 7000 transgender people among the 13 million on active duty but Mattis has questioned whether the study is accurateIm not willing to sign up for the [Rand Corp] numbers you just used and Im not willing to sign up for the concern any of [the transgender service members] have considering what the chairman said Mattis said earlier this month And Im not willing to prejudge what the study will now bring outTrumps ban has prompted lawsuits that challenge its constitutionality and rebukes from Democrats in CongressThere is no place for discrimination in our Armed Forces or indeed anywhere else in American society 143 House Democrats said in a letter Tuesday Enforcing your ban could mean discharging active duty soldiers sailors Marines and members of the Air Force who are serving honorably It also would mean barring other patriotic Americans from serving in the futureA top US general said Thursday that the Pentagon has informed Russia of where US Special Operations forces are operating in Syriatold reporters that the United States has outlined to the Russians where the US forces are operating in not specific areas but firmly broad areas to ensure the troops safetyPentagon press secretary Peter Cook would not go into specifics regarding the size of thoseareas detailed by Brown Cook said the highest levels of leadership within the Pentagon have discussed the Special Operations forces locations with the Russians but refrained from saying when those discussions took place Brown however said that the Russians have been made aware of the Special Operations forces presence within Syria around the same time the Pentagon announced their deployment in December[]In October roughly a month after Russia started airstrikes in Syria the Pentagon and the Russian Ministry of Defense established a memorandum of understanding that outlined specific safety protocols for air crews to follow so that Russian and US aircraft could avoid one another in the rapidly crowding skies over SyriaAccording to Cook at the time of thememorandums announcement the document specifically did not establish zones of cooperation intelligence sharing or any sharing of target information in SyriaOn Thursday Cook explained that giving the Special Operations forces location to the Russians was the only instance in whichthe United States has gone outside the framework of the original memorandum He said it was doneto provide additional safety to US forces operating on the ground[]Though Russian airstrikes have been largely directed toward supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assads ground forces some airstrikes have hit the Islamic State in areas where US aircraft are operating It is unclear how close Russian aircraft have flown to US ground forces if they have at allThe White House authorized the deployment of approximately 50 Special Operations troops to northern Syria late last year to help assess and potentiallytrain US-backed local forces fighting the Islamic State The location of the Special Operations troops has been kept largely secret for security purposes and details of their mission have not been disclosedThe Pentagon unveiled a proposal Tuesday to boost spending on advanced weaponry and the US footprint in Europe part of a plan to refocus the defense budget to counter technological and military advances by Russia and ChinaOn Tuesday Defense Secretary Ashton B Carter previewed the Pentagon budget proposal for fiscal 2017 making a case for why Chinas rapid military buildup and Russias intervention beyond its borders pose a bigger dangerto US security and merit larger investments than does the immediate threatfrom the Islamic StateWe dont have the luxury of just one opponent or the choice between current fights and future fights Carter said in an address at the Economic Club of Washington We have to do bothThe proposal reflects Carters attempt to broaden the militarys focus to include not just the insurgent conflicts of the post-2001 era but also higher-end threats from Russia and China whose military innovation US officials acknowledge has at times out-paced the United StatesA senior defense official who like others spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the plans said the advances made by Russia and China do force a competition that has to be confronted in the next decadeAlmost half of the new investments Carter will propose are related to what officials see as a growing threat from Moscow where President Vladimir Putin has demonstrated his willingness to employ Russian military might from Ukraine to SyriaDespite repeated cease-fire agreements the conflict in Ukrainethere between Russian-backed separatists and the government in KievIf approved by Congress the budget plan would quadruple funding to bolster the American military presence in Europe under an initiative Obama introduced in the wake of Russias move into Ukraine in 2014Under the proposed expansion to the European Reassurance Initiative which would grow to $34 billion in 2017 under the new budget plan the Pentagon would increase the US troop presence in Europe expand positioning of combat vehicles and other equipment there help allies build up military infrastructure and train more allied troopsIn addition to the 62000 active duty service members stationed in 12 European nations the Pentagon has had about 10000-15000 extraforces there since the summer of 2014While Obamas 2014initiative was welcomed by allies near Russias borders it also stirred fears of a new arms race with an unpredictable power on the edge of EuropeA senior administration official said the expanded US presence was a result of more than a year of studying what European defenses require This is not really a provocation or an escalation the official said Rather it is the result of our longer term response to Russias foreign interventionsThe Obama administration also hopes the expanded American presence will prompt European countries to increase their own military spendingThe budget also seeks to chart a course for countering the military advances Russia and China have made in recent years not only in building up traditional military assets but also in areas such as cyber It is fundamental for our department is to out-innovate and to stay ahead the first official saidUnder the new spending plan the Pentagon would spend $714 billion on research and development in 2017 an increase of about $13 billion In making those investment officials appear to be favoring smaller-scale unmanned systems such as a newly developed micro-drone That tiny hand-held device is made by 3D printing and can be dropped in swarms out of a fighter jet at high speedsOther new technology investments include a high-speed projectile that can be fired from existing Navy guns to protect against incoming missiles an alternative to more expensive missile defenses such as the Patriot Officials also hope to invest tens of billions of dollars in coming years on underwater weapons and enhancing weaponry on existing vesselsThe emphasis on maritime technologies comes as the Obama administration faces mounting pressure to mount a more muscular response to While its military spending is still smaller than Washingtons China has enjoyed double-digit increases in its defense budget recent years placing a special emphasis on building itself as a as it asserts ever-wider territorial claims in disputed watersJust last week the Pentagon sent a missile destroyer  in the South China Sea in response to Chinese claims thereThe fiscal 2017 budget is likely to be the sole budget developed and presented by Carter the academic and longtime defense technocrat took office nearly a year ago and is likely to step down with President Obama in early 2017Todd Harrison a defense spending expert at the Center for International and Strategic Studies cautioned that while Carters budget proposal may help shape the debate about future defense spending it may have limited impactThe department may start down a certain path but youre going to have a new team next year and theyre likely to shift the course slightly he saidHarrison said that Carter who appears to be opting for investments in technology and innovation rather than trying to protect a larger force would have to manage friction with some military leaders over his approach to the Pentagons future Carter is already  with his Navy secretary Ray Mabus in part over his plans to shift away from a ship the Pentagons top leadership say lacks firepower Service chiefs and the heads of regional commands such as US Central Command meanwhile are grappling with a host of dangers such as an expanding network of Islamic State affiliates with limited resourcesThe services and combatant commanders they tend to be more worried about the near term because its their problem Harrison said The long term belongs to someone elseCarters budget would provide a 50 percentincrease to proposed spending against the Islamic State in 2017 to $75 billion Part of that would go to replacing spent munitions $18 billion for buying 45000 smart bombs and laser-guided rocketsand funding an expansion of The plan would also increase spending on cyber capabilities to around $7 billion an increase of nearly $1 billion That would include efforts to make the Pentagons electronic infrastructurewhich like other parts of the US government in the last yearmore secure and to boost offensive cyber capabilitiesJon W Davidsons work day began at 630 am Pacifictime on Wednesday moments after President Trumpmade the unexpected announcement onTwitter that he would  from serving in the militaryDavidson legal director of the LGBT rights group Lambda Legal was stillprocessing thepresidents out-of-the-blue tweets when the worried emails started pouring into his inbox Somecame from troops fearing discharge others from people just trying to wrap their heads around Trumps decisionAround 9 pm more than 14 hours later Davidson said he had just finished reading all the messagesWere hearing from all sorts of transgender people today asking things like Did I just getfired by tweet Davidson told The Washington Post People are scared They dont know what this really meansAcross the country attorneys and advocacy groups like Lambda are gearing up to challenge Trumps decision in court saying potential plaintiffs are already lining up to file suit Theyargue itruns afoul of the Constitutions Equal Protection and Due Process clauses discriminates against a vulnerable group and lacks the rational basis necessaryto be upheld by federal judgesThe only thing keeping them from the courthouse for now is the ambiguity of the announcement The president has issued no executive order no policy memo no guidance no rulemaking just a stringof tweets in classic Trump fashionAt the first sign of a formal policy Davidson and others areprepared to sue the government on behalf of current transgender service members and those seeking to enlist The rush of litigation if it comes could wind up resembling the flurry of lawsuits filed by immigration advocates after Trump issued his travel ban earlier this year many of them fighting detentions and deportations and challenging the legality of the executive orderWe believe that anysuch change in policy would be absolutely unconstitutional Davidson said of the transgender ban and it violates fundamental notions of fairness in the militaryThe LGBT military group OutServe-SLDN said it would join the effort in a heartbeat along with the National Center for Lesbian Rights which called the move a bizarre assault on these dedicated service members The American Civil Liberties Unionalso threatened to file suitcalling on transgender services members to get in touch with the organizationThis isan outrageous and desperate action ACLU senior staff attorney Joshua Block said in a  There is no basis for turning trans people away from our military and the ACLU is examining all of our options on how to fight thisTrumps Twitter fiat would reverse a year-old Obama administration decision to allow transgender military membersto serve openly and it could result in thousands of active-duty troops being discharged as  reported WednesdayIn his tweets the president offered two rationales for the move medical costs and disruptionPlease be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the US Military Trumpwrote Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entailPressed byreporters on how such a policy would be carried out White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said there was no implementation plan yet and did not discuss Wednesday whether current transgender troops would be allowed to continue serving Thousands of service members are transgender with as many as 11000 in the reserves and active-duty military according to a recent Pentagon-commissioned studyJohn Culhane a constitutional law professor at Delaware Law School predicted the Trump administration may soon learn that singling out a class of people for exclusion violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection under the law In a commentary for  on Wednesday Culhane noted that untold numbers of transgender soldiers came out and others enlisted as a result of the Obama administration policy that allowed them to serve openly Dischargingthem he wrote would create problems of reliance the legal principle of acting on anothers promiseIf trans people are discharged lawsuits will follow Culhane wrote Even if they arent we can expect attorneys to seek a declaration from courts that no such discharges would be legalCourts give extra deference to the military on personnel matters but that doesnt mean the military is above the law according toSarah Warbelow the Human Rights Campaigns legal director who told  that Trumps declaration amounted to discrimination on the basis of sex and identityDavidson of Lambda echoed her remarks saying that while Trump had considerable powers as commander in chief military policies arefar from unreviewable in courtDavidson also argued that Trumps reasons for enacting a ban on transgender people in the military were demonstrably false andwould beincorporated in his groups challengeTransgender people have been serving openly for a year and there have been no disruptions he said That disproves this notion that theres some threat to military readiness and unit cohesionIn the event that Trumps proposal doeswind up in federal court its not clear how the administration would defend it Sanders the White House spokeswoman offered the faintest of hints Wednesday telling reporters that the presidents decision focused solely on military readinessLook I think sometimes you have to make decisions and once he made a decision he didnt feel it was necessary to hold that decision and theyre going to work together with the Department of Defense to lawfully implement it Sanders said She added that Trump had informedDefense Secretary Jim Mattis of his move on TuesdayMattis who was on vacationdidnt comment on the issue Wednesday The Pentagon referred questions about Trumps tweets back to the White HouseIn the interest of fairness it would be helpful to include more details here elucidating Trumps decision but such insights are hard to come byFor the time being Davidson and other civil rights attorneys have stressed that nothing about existing military policy has changed yet and that the presidents tweetscarry no force of lawIts so strange to be dealing with a situation and youre not sure what to believe is true and whether hell do what he says hes going to do Davidson said Were in an

(@TonyAtamanuik)What was finally real was Edgar Welch driving from North Carolina to Washington to rescue sexually abused children he believed were hidden in mysterious tunnels beneath a neighborhood pizza jointWhat was real was Welch  a father former firefighter and sometime movie actor who was drawn to dark mysteries he found on the Internet  terrifying customers and workers with his assault-style rifle as he searched Comet Ping Pong police said He found no hidden children no secret chambers no evidence of a child sex ring run by the failed Democratic candidate for president of the United States or by her campaign chief or by the owner of the pizza placeWhat was false were the rumors he had read stories that crisscrossed the globe about a charming little pizza place that features ping-pong tables in its back roomThe story of Pizzagate is about what is fake and what is real Its a tale of a scandal that never was and of a fear that has spread through channels that did not even exist until recentlyPizzagate  the belief that code words and satanic symbols point to a sordid underground along an ordinary retail strip in the nations capital  is possible only because science has produced the most powerful tools ever invented to find and disseminate informationWhat brought Welch to the District on a crisp Sunday afternoon in early December was a choking mix of rumor political nastiness technological change and the intoxicating thrill that can come from running down a mysteryHis actions Sunday in one of Washingtons wealthiest neighborhoods reminded Americans that last months election did not quite conclude the strangest political season in the nations history Welch did not shoot anyone in the disturbance on Connecticut Avenue NW but he delivered a troubling message about the shattering of trust in a troubled time On Oct 28 FBI Director James B Comey told Congress that he was reopening the investigation of Hillary Clintons use of a private email server when she was secretary of state New emails had been found on a computer belonging to disgraced former New York congressman Anthony Weiner the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin Two days later someone tweeting under the handle @DavidGoldbergNY cited rumors that the new emails point to a pedophilia ring and @HillaryClinton is at the center The rumor was retweeted more than 6000 timesThe notion quickly moved to other social-media platforms including 4chan and Reddit mostly through anonymous or pseudonymous posts On the far-right site Infowars talk-show host Alex Jones repeatedly suggested that Clinton was involved in a child sex ring and that her campaign chairman John Podesta indulged in satanic ritualsWhen I think about all the children Hillary Clinton has personally murdered and chopped up and raped I have zero fear standing up against her Jones said in  posted on Nov 4 Yeah you heard me right Hillary Clinton has personally murdered children I just cant hold back the truth anymore Jones eventually tied his comments about Clinton to US policy in SyriaAccording to YouTube that video has been viewed more than 427000 timesOver the next couple of days the wild accusations against Clinton gradually merged with a new raft of allegations stemming from WikiLeaks release of Podestas emails Those emails showed that Podesta occasionally dined at Comet Ping PongOn Nov7 the hashtag #pizzagate first appeared on Twitter Over the next several weeks it would be tweeted and retweeted hundreds or thousands of times each day An oddly disproportionate share of the tweets about Pizzagate appear to have come from of all places the Czech Republic Cyprus and Vietnam said Jonathan Albright an assistant professor of media analytics at Elon University in North Carolina In some cases the most avid retweeters appeared to be bots programs designed to amplify certain news and informationWhat bots are doing is really getting this thing trending on Twitter Albright said These bots are providing the online crowds that are providing legitimacyOnline the more something is retweeted or otherwise shared the more prominently it appears in social media and on sites that track trending news As the bots joined ordinary Twitter users in pushing out Pizzagate-related rumors the notion spread like wildfire Who programmed the bots to focus on that topic remains unknown On the Friday before the election James Alefantis who owns two restaurants on the same block in upper Northwest Washington noticed something odd in his Instagram feed a stream of comments calling him a pedophileUpset Alefantis told some of his young employees at Comet Ping Pong about the hateful comments and they poked around online They found rapidly burgeoning discussions on Reddit 4chan and Instagram about a purported child sex ring operating out of their restaurantAlefantis who grew up in an affluent section of the District was no stranger to politics He had held a fundraiser for the Clinton campaign at Comet Hed had a relationship with David Brock the erstwhile Clinton nemesis who had a midcareer political conversion and became a pro-Clinton advocate And Alefantis had lots of customers and friends in liberal Democratic circlesWhen Alefantis opened Comet a decade ago hed had a run-in with an advisory neighborhood commissioner a local official who did not like it when Comet put ping-pong tables on the sidewalk That commissioner had warned that having game tables on the sidewalk might bring rapes and murders to the virtually crime-free neighborhoodNow a decade later a Washington Post column about that dispute was trending on Twitter Somewhere out there thousands of people were hungrily searching the Internet for anything remotely troubling about Comet Ping PongIn the final days before the election other shopkeepers on the block began to receive threatening phone calls and disturbing emails Strangers from faraway places demanded to know about symbols on their shop windows or photos on their wallsAcross from Comet at the French bistro Terasol co-owner Sabrina Ousmaal noticed a disturbing Google review of her restaurant that alleged that Terasol too was involved in a plot to abuse childrenThen more online comments appeared focusing on a photo on Terasols website that showed Ousmaal and her daughter posing with Clinton who had eaten there several years earlier The Internet sleuths also fixated on a heart logo that appeared on the restaurants site as part of a fundraiser for St Jude Childrens Research Hospital which Ousmaal a cancer survivor has supported for yearsThese maniacs thought that was a symbol of child pornography said her husband and business partner Alan Moin Its crazyThe family removed the symbol from their site but the online comments adapted to the new reality Terasol must be hiding something The anonymous calls increasedWhat can we do Ousmaal said There is no basement There is no tunnel There is nothingAlefantis and other merchants were mystified Where was this all coming from Cant anyone make it stopThe merchants approached Facebook and Twitter and asked that disparaging fictitious comments about them be removed The shopkeepers said the replies they got advised them to block individual users who were harassing themThe owner of 4chan Hiroyuki Nishimura said in an email to The Post that Pizzagate reminds me that a country indicated [there were] stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and many people and countries were deceived It is same old storyNishimura a Japanese Internet entrepreneur said the rumors about Comet could be false Some people who believe they do something good may be deceived by false information But he said their motive was good they did it for saving childrenOn Connecticut Avenue the hate calls and death threats kept mounting Surely the shopkeepers thought this will all go away after the election On Election Day Brittany Pettibone a right-wing online activist in California who writes science-fiction novels with her twin sister tweeted drawings of children under the label Sexualized children child abuse pools and bondage She wrote that the images were a look inside Hillary Clintons friend Tony Podestas house Tony Podesta a Washington lobbyist is Johns brotherPettibone attached the hashtag #PizzaGate We need to expose this she wrote in another tweetDozens of commenters responded almost immediately How do we make this VIRAL one wroteSeveral of the most frequent and prominent purveyors of the Pizzagate rumors said they first learned about the supposed conspiracy from Pettibones postingsI was one of the first Pettibone said in a brief conversation Tuesday She said she would not take part in an interview Im uninclined to speak to mainstream media because during the election cycle they made the right look like nut jobs because we suspected Hillary had a health issue and it turned out she didFor a few days after Donald Trumps victory a relative calm returned to Comet But along the block merchants were hearing from all manner of strange callers At Besta Pizza owner Abdel Hammad got an urgent message from the company that maintains his website A reviewer alleged that his shops simple pizza-shaped logo was a symbol of child pornography Hammad an Egyptian immigrant who voted for Trump was stunnedIts a slice of pizza he saidHammad removed the image from his site but could not afford more than $2000 to pay for new signs out frontWhy did you change the website anonymous callers screamed at him on the phoneWere going to put a bullet in your head one threatenedDown the block at Politics and Prose Bookstore employees noticed tweets and other online posts that included them on a list of stores linked by underground tunnels that do not existThe fact that one of the shops co-owners Lissa Muscatine had worked as Clintons speechwriter and adviser for two decades quickly became one more data point in the Pizzagate activists conspiracy theoryThe shops phone rang off the hook with profane abusive calls from across the country Employees simply hung up over and overFrustrated and frightened merchants along the block talked to the police They called the FBI which said the threats were a local matter On Nov16 Jack Posobiec a former Navy Reserve intelligence officer who had spent much of the previous year as a leader of a pro-Trump grass-roots organization decided hed had enough of just reading tweets and blog posts about the pizza place in his cityPosobiec 31 had never eaten at Comet he had never even heard of the place until he started reading about it on conservative antigovernment media sites I didnt pay much attention to it before Election Day because I was focused on the campaign he said With that going on who wants to talk about pizzaNow with Trump elected he read the posts more closely Any story that accused Clinton John Podesta and Brock of nefarious deeds deserved some investigation he thought He believed the Clinton campaign was full of secrecy and deceptionIt seemed reasonable to Posobiec that Podesta might have organized a sex ring in cahoots with Brock But the only part of the scenario that was real was that Podesta had been known to eat pizza at Comet This part is false pictures purporting to show that symbols such as butterflies and spirals in signs at Comet and other shops were statements about pedophiliaPosobiec said he was curious and confused He and a friend decided to go have some pizza They walked into Comet eight days after the election sat down and ordered Posobiec got the garlic knots His friend got a beer But they were not just hanging out Posobiec was using his phone to broadcast his evening at Comet on Periscope an app that allows users to stream video livePart of the experience of living in 2016 is live on-the-scene broadcasts he said People have lost faith with government and the mainstream media being any real authority After the Iraq War after Benghazi people are searching for other sources of information If I can do something with Periscope and show what Im seeing with my own two eyes thats helpfulPosobiec said he never made any disturbance inside Comet but the restaurants managers saw him take his camera into a back room where a childs birthday party was underway It did not seem appropriate for a childs party to be broadcast on a strangers Periscope feed The manager asked two DC police officers who happened to be across the street to assistPosobiec and his friend were gently refused service and asked to leave said a person familiar with the restaurants decisionPosobiec offered to pay for what he had ordered The manager said it was on the housePosobiec said he was not there to make a scene I didnt have any preconceived notions he said I wasnt sure I thought I could just show it was a regular pizza placeThat evening after Posobiec was ushered out of Comet Pettibone tweeted Youre my hero for doing this Jack Never let goOn Twitter the hashtag #pizzagate peaked in the hours after Posobiecs video appearedOn Nov22 Reddit closed its r/pizzagate subreddit a site forum focused on a particular topic The site said it was concerned that Pizzagate posts were revealing private information about people at Comet and nearby stores We dont want witch-hunts on our site it said The decision sparked allegations of censorship from some people who were spreading the Pizzagate rumors They moved their discussion to a similar site Voat On Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend two men carrying protest signs showed up outside CometAlefantis went outside and offered the men coffee They declined the offerOn the phone and online threats poured in with as many as 150 calls a dayThe shopkeepers approached DC police for help An officer advised them that the online rumormongering was constitutionally protected speech Ousmaal replied in an email that she respects freedom of speech but that derogatory libelous and hateful blogs and emails should not and cannot qualifyThe officer Anthony Baker responded I dont have anymore options to give unfortunatelyA DC police statement issued Tuesday said that the department became aware of the fictional allegations contained in the false news story last month however despite postings of offensive language we did not receive reports of any specific threats Officers advised the staff to immediately report to police any threats made against the establishment or individuals Earlier this fall in Salisbury NC Edgar Maddison Welch saw some friends doing drugs and he started preaching at them aggressivelyDanielle Tillman 23 was the best friend of Welchs girlfriend She said she had just taken acid when Welch got upset chanting Jesus name at herHe grabbed my hand and got in my face and was like Let the demons out of her Tillman recalled It was super weirdWelch known to friends as Maddison had struck friends as a sweet young man whod had trouble finding his way He had dabbled in acting  his father ran a small movie studio out of his house  and in writing and firefighting None of it stuck He liked to hike long stretches out West through mountain ranges over rivers into national forestsA few years ago he told his hometown newspaper that through hiking he had broken his addiction to the InternetBut Welch had another habit He was arrested several times on drug-possession charges and his name appeared on a forged prescription according to police records He was convicted of marijuana possession and public drinking and was sent to a substance-abuse programFriends say Welch 28 in recent months grew far more outwardly religious He sees himself as someone who is a protector said his friend Charles Dobson 28 He is just a thrill-seeking guyOn his Facebook page Welch has posted biblical verses and psalms some related to the end of days along with photos of his two children Only by your power can we push back our enemies one verse reads Only in your name can we trample our foesA few years ago Welch told a longtime friend and former roommate Dane Granberry about stories he had read online describing miles of secret tunnels under the Denver airport Welch who had also been fascinated by conspiracy theories about the Sept11 2001 attacks having been staged by the United States had become obsessed with the tunnels idea and spent long hours reading articles watching videos and searching for detailsHes into doing his own research Granberry said I dont think he has very much faith in the media but none of us do Granberry said her friend needed to see things for himselfOn Friday or Saturday Welch drove to the District according to court testimony He showed up at Comet on Sunday about 3 pmGareth Wade 47 and Doug Clarke 50 were sitting down for pizza and beer when a server told them that someone had walked in with a gun As Welch passed by their table he told them to vacate the building They rushed outOutside dozens of DC police officers swarmed the area evacuating businesses and blocking off streets A police helicopter circled overheadInside Comet Welch armed with a Colt AR-15 assault rifle a 38-caliber Colt revolver and a folding knife fired his gun two or three times police saidWelch dressed in jeans a T-shirt and a hooded sweatshirt remained inside for about 45 minutes searching for underground vaults or hidden rooms police said At least one gunshot broke off a lock to a door It led not to hidden sex workers but to a computer room The bullet damaged a computer towerAt some point a Comet worker who had been in the back freezer retrieving dough and had missed the earlier commotion heard the shots and emerged into the restaurant Welch swung the rifle in his direction and the worker fled out onto the avenue police saidFinally Welch responded to police calls for him to leave the building and surrender He put his AR-15 on top of a beer keg and his revolver on a table He came out with his hands up following police commands to walk backward toward themWelch was handcuffed and Sgt Benjamin Firehock asked him why he had done it Welch said according to the arrest affidavit that he had read online that the Comet restaurant was harboring child sex slaves and that he wanted to see for himself if they were there [Welch] stated that he was armed to help rescue them [Welch] surrendered peacefully when he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurantWithin hours of Welchs arrest online conspiracy theorists had already decided that he was not one of them Some suggested he was a false flag a government plant  an enemy of their cause  who had been used in an elaborate plot to conceal the truthFor years people have made similar claims about everything from the 9/11 attacks (a government conspiracy to justify war they say) to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting (a government conspiracy to justify gun control they say)Now in Welchs case the conspiracy theorists insisted that the real news about his dangerous assault was in fact fake newsComet Ping Pong reopened Tuesday night the crowd was large and supportive For some months now Stefanie MacWilliams 24 a stay-at-home mother of a 1-year-old boy in Ontario has written nearly every day usually about politics for Planet Free Will a conservative website based in the United States Her husband a mechanic is the familys main breadwinner but MacWilliams has been earning some money too writing a lot about how good Trump would be for America and a fair amount about how bad President Obama wasStarting in early November MacWilliams noticed that stories based on the Podesta emails were making waves A friend who knows Im interested in politics and shares conspiracy things with me sent MacWilliams stories about Comet Ping PongThen she happened upon Posobiecs live stream from Comet This she decided was a story She told the Pizzagate tale in a YouTube video on Twitter and on Planet Free WillIn the third paragraph of her story MacWilliams wrote that we must stress that there is as yet no concrete evidence of any wrongdoing She thought she was being quite responsible She had read Internet chatter about strange happenings and code words and she thought this needed investigation She was miffed that Posobiec had been escorted out of Comet when his video tour might have gotten to the bottom of the mysteryMacWilliamss story spread via social media She became part of what she called a worldwide citizen investigation of PizzagateWhen she saw Reddit and Twitter react to the conspiracy theory respectively shutting down a discussion forum and suspending the accounts of some users she worried that a coverup was underway As soon as you tell people they cant talk about something theyre going to talk about it a whole lot more she saidMacWilliams calls herself a journalist but she does not try to be 100 percent accurate either She believes the beauty of the Internet is that people can crowdsource the truth Eventually what is real will emerge she saidPizzagate she said is two worlds clashing People dont trust the mainstream media anymore but its true that people shouldnt take the alternative media as truth either The lack of stories about Pizzagate in the mainstream press meant that the back channels of the Internet would step into the breachBut how does this end What could constitute proof that there is no conspiracy Some Pizzagate buffs want a video tour showing that there are no secret rooms or tunnels Others say they would need moreMacWilliams remains caught up in the thrill of the chase There is a camaraderie to it she said It is like sitting around with your friends saying What really happened to JFK It is like a giant game especially nowadays when you can crowdsource thousands of emails and figure out whats going on Its like a real-life Kennedy assassination where all the stuff is at your fingertips and its happening todayWhen the New York Times mentioned her site on Nov21 as a source of fake news MacWilliams got a little angry but she also had reason to smile The traffic on Planet Free Will soared as never before The story is everywhere Some Americans especially keen on Pizzagate find themselves being accused of being Russian stooges or of working for hackers intent on disrupting the American political processIn a small city north of Tel Aviv in the small hours of the night Avrahaum Segol a New Yorker who emigrated to Israel 15 years ago makes call after call back to Washington He says he has never been to Comet Ping Pong but he is burning with a need to know He found the elderly woman whose family once owned the colorful neon sign that sits over Comets front door Alefantis bought the sign from a defunct liquor store in Adams MorganSegol called the woman and spelled out his baroque story He quoted from an HG Wells story called  and he wondered whether the symbols on the sign  crescents and stars  might reveal a message about sexual misdeeds or satanic ritualsThe woman listened to some of this then told Segol Youre an idiot She hung up on him He is undeterred He sends letters to the president of the United States and the chief justice and to newspaper editors and reporters and to TV and radio hosts He calls The Post to explain how the Supreme Courts ruling on same-sex marriage connects with the symbols on the Comet sign He calls to explain why his family left him He calls to say why the death of a former CIA chief may be connected to Pizzagate He calls to ask whether the neighborhood around Comet is known for murderers and thievesWere living in such a queer time Segol said He said his investigation of Pizzagate is a work of art I tell my kids There are no mysteries only facts unknownHe asks to be

though it could be extendedDirty air in India and China Tainted water in sub-Saharan Africa Toxic mining and smelter operations in South America Pollution around the globe now contributes toan estimated 9 million deaths annually  or roughly one in six  according to an in-depth  published Thursday in the LancetIf accurate that means pollution kills three times more people each year thanHIV/AIDS tuberculosis and malaria combined with most of those deaths in poor and developing countriesGoing into this my colleagues and I knew that pollution killed a lot of people But we certainly did not have any idea of the total magnitude of the problem said Philip Landrigan dean of global health at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and co-chair of the commission behind the report I think all of us were really surprised when we saw thisThe two-year project which relied on data from researchers in more than 130 countries documenting the causes of disease and premature deaths in recent decades found that poor air quality was the most significant pollution-related killer That includes both outdoor pollution tainted by mercury arsenic and other harmful particulates and household air dirtied by the burning of wood dung and other organic materials The result An estimated 65 million deaths in 2015 from heart disease strokes lung cancer and other respiratory problemsWater pollution which includes everything from unsafe sanitation to contaminated drinking water accounted for an additional 18 million annual deaths from gastrointestinal diseases and other infections researchers foundPollution in the workplace also took a heavy toll on some of the worlds poorest workers From bladder cancer in dye workers to the lung disease pneumoconiosis in coal miners researchers found that occupational exposure tovarious carcinogens and toxins was linked to about 800000 deaths annuallyIn 2015 the largest number of deaths attributable to pollution occurred in India and China with an estimated 25 million and 18 million deaths respectively Other severely affected countries include Pakistan Bangladesh and KenyaBeyond the massive human toll the authors of Thursdays report also focused on thefinancial toll caused by pollution-related health problemsUntil now people havent recognized what an incredible hit pollution makes on the economy of a country Landrigan said Pollution control can stimulate the economy because it reduces death and diseaseThey estimated the hit to national budgets at about 13 percent of gross domestic product in low-income countries compared toabout05 percent in developed high-income countries In addition nations facing crippling pollutiontend to spendmuch more on health care to treat diseases related to the problemWhen youre looking at developing countries you really have to address this challenge if you want to move people out of poverty and into the middle class said Gina McCarthy a former Environmental Protection Agency administrator who was not involved in the study but had studied its conclusions It is holding people backAnd the warming of the Earths climate is likely to fuel more deaths in the absence of international action she saidClimate change is going to exacerbate the very problems that are identified in this article There will be more contagious and infectious diseases There will be more lives lost more injuries if we dont identifya path that gets us out of the hole that were in McCarthy said Whatpeople dont realize is the instability that results from poverty the instability that results from migration as a result of climate changeThe startlingconclusion that pollution accounts for 16 percent of deaths worldwide is of course an estimate But the findings build on previous studies including a 2016 report from the World Health Organization detailing the extent to which pollution represents a public health crisisIf countries do not take actions to make environments where people live and work healthy millions will continue to become ill and die too young then-WHO Director-General Margaret Chan McCarthy said the Lancet study also is built on the most complete epidemiological data availableThese are the best numbers that we have available to us And even if theyre off by a factor of10 youre still talking about huge huge impacts But theyre not off by a factor of 10 she said Its very clear if you go to other countries and its clear if you go to some of our own communities that they are being held back because of the impact of pollution on their kids and their elderly And we have to stop thinking that because we cant see the pollution and its not as visible that its not thereLandrigan said there is an old wives tale that developing countries inevitably suffer through troublesome pollution and disease on their way to becoming more prosperousRather he and the studys other authors insisted that countriesmustdo muchto reduce pollution and improve the health of their citizens  and that they will reap economic benefits for doing so In addition he said developed nations can play a meaningful role in helping poorer countries slash pollution and major nonprofit foundations that have largely steered clear of the problem must be convinced that it is a global priorityIt doesnt have to [get worse] Its not an inevitable outcome Landrigan said of the annual death toll Pollution control is a winnable battleThe Fact Checker earlier produced as President Trumps national security adviser Now that story has merged with Trumps firing of FBI Director James B Comey Below is a new timeline incorporating some elements of the Flynn timeline Key aspects of the Trump and Comey interactions remain in dispute so we will keep updating this as new information emerges The Obama administration  measures against Russia in retaliation for what US officials characterized as interference in the 2016 election ordering the expulsion of Russian intelligence operatives and slapping new sanctions on state agencies and individuals suspected in the hacks of US computer systemsFlynn incoming national security adviser for Trump  with Russias ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak and discusses the sanctions and suggests the possibility of sanctions relief once Trump is president The call is monitored by US intelligence agencies Comey briefs Trump about the intelligence community assessment concerning Russias efforts to intefere with the presidential election Comey in written congressional testimony on June 8 says he was tasked to pull Trump aside and brief him on the contents of an unverified dossier that was personally sensitive to the president-elect Based on President-elect Trumps reaction to the briefing and without him directly asking the question Comey tells Trump he is not the subject of an open counter-intelligence investigation After the meeting Comey immediately wrote a memo about the conversation as sson as he returned to his car I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting and so I thought it really important to document he told lawmakers Trump takes the oath of office and becomes president Trump singles out Comey at a White House event and hugs him Oh and theres Jim Hes become more famous than meTrump was presumably referring to Comeys announcement days before the election that the FBI might have found new information in the Hillary Clinton email case Clinton  and many other Democrats  say Comeys announcement tipped a close election toward Trump) He tried hard to blend into the background and avoid any one-on-one interaction He was wearing a blue blazer and noticed that the drapes were blue So he stood in the back right in front of the drapes hoping Trump wouldnt notice him camouflaged against the wall  Comey took the long walk across the room determined he told me that there was not going to be a hug Bad enough that he was there bad enough that there would be a handshake he emphatically did not want any show of warmth Again look at the video and youll see Comey preemptively reaching out to shake hands Trump grabs his hand and attempts an embrace The embrace however is entirely one sided Comey was disgusted He regarded the episode as a physical attempt to show closeness and warmth in a fashion calculated to compromise him before Democrats who already mistrusted him Flynn is interviewed by the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak Acting attorney general Sally Yates accompanied by an aide goes to the White House and tells White House Counsel Donald McGahn that contrary to Flynns claims to White House officials sanctions had been discussed in the calls based on the monitoring of the conversations by intelligence agencies She also warns that Flynn is vulnerable to blackmail by Moscow McGahn asks Yates to come to the White House again to discuss the matter further Yates testified that he did not indicate whether he had discussed the Flynn situation with anyone else at the White House but White House press secretarySean Spicer told reporters the president was immediately informed of the situation McGahnasked why the Justice Department would be concerned whether one White House official lied to another she said Logic would tell you that you dont want the national security adviser to be in a position where the Russians have leverage over him she saidMcGahn also asks to see the underlying evidence Yates says she would work with the FBI to assemble the material and McGahns review is scheduled for Jan 30 That night Trump and Comey have dinner at the White House But they disagree over who asked for the meeting He wanted to have dinner because he wanted to stay on We had a very nice dinner at the White House  That dinner was arranged I think he asked for the dinner I was at the Hoover Building on the 27th of January for another event and spoke briefly with Director Comey He mentioned to me the invitation he had from the president for dinner and that he was my characterization uneasy with it both from a standpoint of the optic of compromising his independence and the independence of the FBIAt the dinner Trump reportedly asks Comey for his loyalty according to news reports The President began by asking me whether I wanted to stay on as FBI Director which I found strange My instincts told me that the one-on-one setting and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position meant the dinner was at least in part an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship That concerned me greatly given the FBIs traditionally independent status in the executive branchI added that I was not on anybodys side politically and could not be counted on in the traditional political sense a stance I said was in his best interest as the President A few moments later the President said I need loyalty I expect loyalty I didnt move speak or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed We simply looked at each other in silenceNear the end of our dinner the President returned to the subject of my jobHe then said I need loyalty I replied You will always get honesty from me He paused and then said Thats what I want honest loyalty I paused and then said You will get that from meComey also indicated that he again told Trump he was not under investigation He said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didnt happen Comey recounted in his written testimony I replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally which we werent and because it was very difficult to prove a negativeI didnt but I dont think it would be a bad question to ask I think loyalty to the country loyalty to the United States is important You know I mean it depends on how you define loyalty Number one Number two I dont know how that got there because I didnt ask that questionTrumps lawyer Marc Kasowitz said after Comeystestimony The president also never told Mr Comey quote I need loyalty I expect loyalty closed quote He never said it in for and he never said it in substance Trump fires Yates allegedly over an unrelated matter  her conclusion that Trumps executive order barring travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries was unlawful The executive order is later blocked by the courts The Washington Post  that the White House had known for weeks that Flynn had misled people about the nature of the Kislyak calls Flynn is forced to resign within hours after the article is posted Spicer on Feb 14 said Flynn was let go because he no longer had the trust of the president and vice president In an Oval Office meeting Trump asks Comey to end the investigation of Flynn according to Comey On February 14 I went to the Oval Office for a scheduled counterterrorism briefing of the President Comey said in his congressional testimony The President signaled the end of the briefing by thanking the group and telling them all that he wanted to speak to me aloneWhen the door by the grandfather clock closed and we were alone the President began by saying I want to talk about Mike Flynn  The President began by saying Flynn hadnt done anything wrong in speaking with the Russians but he had to let him go because he had misled the Vice President He added that he had other concerns about Flynn which he did not then specify He is a good guy and has been through a lot He repeated that Flynn hadnt done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians but had misled the Vice President He then said I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go to letting Flynn go He is a good guy I hope you can let this go I replied only that he is a good guy I did not say I would let this goUnder questioning by lawmakers Comey said that given the setting and the fact that Trump asked to see him alone he took the presidents words as a directive It rings in my ear as kind of Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest Comey said regarding Henry IIs alleged words that led to the murder of Thomas Becket the archbishop of Canterbury in 1170 He said that at time Flynn was in legal jeopardy Kasowitz said after Comeys testimony The president never in form or substance directed or suggested that Mr Comey stop investigating anyone including the president never suggested that Mr Comey quote Let Flynn go close quote Trump also  he asked Comey to ease up on the investigation In a tweet Trump claims without evidence that President Barack Obama had tapped his phones during the election campaign A day later news reports  Comey asked the Justice Department to publicly reject Trumps claim But no action is takenHow low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process This is Nixon/Watergate Bad (or sick) guy Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump)  In congressional testimony Comey said he has been cleared by the Justice Department to say there is no information to support Trumps claim about wiretaps He also the FBI was investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russias effortsAfter Comeys testimony  Trump separately asked two of the nations top intelligence officials  Daniel Coats director of national intelligence and Adm Michael S Rogers director of the National Security Agency  to help him push back against the FBI investigation He urgedthem to publicly deny the existence of any evidence of collusion during the 2016 election but both officials refused believing the request was inappropriate Comey says Trump called him This is a summary of his description of the call from his written congressional testimony on June 8On the morning of March 30 the President called me at the FBI He described the Russia investigation as a cloud that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country He said he had nothing to do with Russia had not been involved with hookers in Russia and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia He asked what we could do to lift the cloud I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those Congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating President Trump I reminded him I had previously told him that He repeatedly told me We need to get that fact out The President went on to say that if there were some satellite associates of his who did something wrong it would be good to find that out but that he hadnt done anything wrong Comey says his last conversation with Trump took place in a phone call From his June 8 written testimonyOn the morning of April 11 the President called me and asked what I had done about his request that I get out that he is not personally under investigation I replied that I had passed his request to the Acting Deputy Attorney General but I had not heard back He replied that the cloud was getting in the way of his ability to do his job I said the White House Counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make the request which was the traditional channel He said he would do that and added Because I have been very loyal to you very loyal we had that thing you know I did not reply or ask him what he meant by that thing I said only that the way to handle it was to have the White House Counsel call the Acting Deputy Attorney General He said that was what he would do and the call ended Trump knocks Comey on TwitterFBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds The phony Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump)  Comey  It makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election He offers a defense of his actions in the Hillary Clinton case and indicates the Russian investigation is continuing Trump tells Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod J Rosenstein that he wants to fire Comey Rosenstein crafts  that faults Comey for his handling of the Clinton case although he has refused to say whether anyone asked him to write the memo The White House originally cited the memo as justification for the firing but then later backed off that explanation after Rosenstein complained Comey is fired In his note to Comey Trump says I greatly appreciate you informing me on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation (Trump appears to be referring to the conversations recounted by Comey on Jan 6 Jan 27 and March 30) Trump meets with Russian officials including Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Kislyak I just fired the head of the FBI Trump says  He was crazy a real nut job I faced great pressure because of Russia Thats taken offTrump adds Im not under investigation Rosenstein appoints a special counsel former FBI director Robert S Mueller III to overseethe Russia probe and investigate anyrelated matters such as obstruction of justice and perjury()Russian President Vladimir Putin found a moment Thursday during a wide-ranging news conference to offer a strong endorsement of Republican front-runner Donald Trump calling the billionaire presidential candidate the absolute leader in the presidential racePutin consecrated a  between the two men as he commented on the US campaign for the White House saying that Russia would work with whomever the American voters choose but expressing special praise for TrumpTrump said in October that he would get along very well with Putin and applauded the Russian leader for his intervention against the Islamic State in Syria But until Thursday Trumps praise had gone unreciprocatedHes a very lively man talented without doubt Putin said when journalists approached him after the news conference and asked about Trump Hes saying he wants to go to another level of relations  closer deeper relations with Russia How can we not welcome that Of course we welcome thatIt was a moment of levity during a more than three-hour news conference that touched on Russias battered economy Russias intervention in Syria tense relations with Turkey over the downing of a Russian warplane and the smoldering conflict in Ukraine  During the news conference Putin denied once again that regular Russian forces were in Ukraine where pro-Moscow rebels began clashes with the Western-backed government in 2014 But Putin hinted that Russian military advisers or security forces were active in that country an involvement that he and senior Russian officials have sharply denied in the pastWe never said that we did not have people there who are dealing with certain issues Putin said of southeastern Ukraine the base for the Russian-backed separatists But there are no regular Russian troops there Feel the differencePutins statement came after a Ukrainian journalist passed on a hello from Captain Erofeyev and Sergeant Alexandrov two alleged Russian servicemen captured by Ukrainian government forces Russia has said they quit the army before going to Ukraine  The format of the yearly news conference is a spectacle in itself Nearly 1400 journalists jostle on national television for the opportunity to ask Putin a questionPutin answers in monologues that can stretch as long as 10 minutes making it difficult for reporters to follow upAsked about Russias intervention in the civil war in Syria Putin said Russian forces would remain there at least until a democratic process is launchedThere is a plan Putin said In its key aspects it coincides with the American plan working on the constitution preparing elections in Syria and the recognition of their results But for now we are going to launch strikes and support the Syrian army in its offensiveBut the United States and Russia differ sharply over Syrian President Bashar al-Assad Washington and its allies insist that Assad has no role in Syrias political future Russia and Iran however are key backers of Assad and will likely resist any outcome that lessens their influence in Syria  Russia began airstrikes to back Assad in September but recently Russian analysts and government officials have expressed frustration with the slow speed of the offensive and ineffectiveness of the Syrian troopsIn a closed-door meeting before parliament on Wednesday Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu declined to put a time limit on the intervention but said that Russia cant count on a quick conclusion to the operation the RIA Novosti state news agency reportedA day earlier Putin met with Secretary of State John F Kerry striking an agreement to hold talks Friday in New York on a political settlement that may then be formalized in a United Nations resolutionPutin largely reiterated Russias anger over the downing of one of its warplanes by Turkish jets last month   Life has shown that it is difficult for us practically impossible to come to terms with the incumbent Turkish administration Putin said Even when and where we say that we agree they stab us in the side or in the back for absolutely unclear reasonsHe said that someone in the Turkish government may have ordered the attack on the Russian plane in an effort to please the United States or as he put it to lick the Americans in a particular placePutin also addressed Russias economy which has been hit with high inflation and plunged against the dollar and euro as the price of oil has fallen drastically in recent months While the dollar was worth 35 rubles two years ago it now trades at more than 70 rublesPutin said that he was satisfied with the leadership of Russias government and the Central Bank which steeply hiked interest rates to prevent inflation despite the pain that the move has dealt to businesses and borrowers He said he wanted to lower interest rates but that this would happen only when Russia could do so in a natural way  Putin predicted that Russia would have 07 percent growth in 2016 19 percent growth in 2017 and 24 percent growth in 2018 But he made those predictions with oil trading at $50 a barrel Brent crude was trading at just over $37 a barrel on ThursdayIn a personal moment Putin was asked about the identity of his daughters after a series of investigations in the Russian press revealed that a woman named Katerina Tikhonova had attained a prominent position overseeing millions of dollars in investment at a high-tech business incubator at Moscow State UniversityThey dont engage in business and they dont engage in politics Putin said declining to say whether Tikhonova was his daughter They are never going to get

nationThe law enforcement investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign has identified a current White House official as a significant person of interest showing that the probe is reaching into the highest levels of government according to people familiar with the matterThe senior White House adviser under scrutiny by investigators is someone close to the president according to these people who would not further identify the official  The revelation comes as the investigation appears to be entering a more overtly active phase with investigators shifting from work that has remained largely hidden from the public to conducting interviews and using a grand jury to issue subpoenas The intensity of the probe is expected to accelerate in the coming weeks the people saidThe sources emphasized that investigators remain keenly interested in people who previously wielded influence in the Trump campaign and administration but are no longer part of it including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign chairman Paul ManafortFlynn resigned in February after disclosures that he had lied to administration officials about his contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak Current administration officials who have acknowledged contacts with Russian officials include President Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  People familiar with the investigation said the intensifying effort does not mean criminal charges are near or that any such charges will result Earlier this week Deputy Attorney General Rod J Rosenstein appointed former FBI director Robert S Mueller III to serve as special counsel and lead the investigation into Russian meddling It is unclear exactly how Muellers leadership will affect the direction of the probe and he is already bringing in new people to work on the team Those familiar with the case said its significance had increased before Muellers appointment Although the case began quietly last July as an effort to determine whether any Trump associates coordinated with Russian operatives to meddle in the presidential election campaign the investigative work now being done by the FBI also includes determining whether any financial crimes were committed by people close to the president The people familiar with the matter said the probe has sharpened into something more fraught for the White House the FBI and the Justice Department  particularly because of the public steps investigators know they now need to take the people saidWhen subpoenas are issued or interviews are requested it is possible the people being asked to talk or provide documents will reveal publicly what they were asked about A small group of lawmakers known as the Gang of Eight was notified of the change in tempo and focus in the investigation at a classified briefing Wednesday evening the people familiar with the matter said Then-FBI Director James B Comey  in March Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said I cant confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of investigations or targets of investigations An FBI spokesman declined to comment White House spokesman Sean Spicer said As the president has stated before a thorough investigation will confirm that there was no collusion between the campaign and any foreign entityWhile there has been a loud public debate in recent days over  in his private dealings with Comey whom Trump fired last week people familiar with the matter said investigators on the case are more focused on Russian influence operations and possible financial crimesThe FBIs investigation seeks to determine whether and to what extent Trump associates were  what business dealings they might have had in Russia and whether they in any way facilitated the hacking and publishing of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clintons campaign chairman John Podesta during the presidential campaign Several congressional committees are also investigating though their probes could not produce criminal charges   A grand jury in Alexandria Va recently issued a subpoena for records related to Flynns business the Flynn Intel Group which was paid more than $500000 by a company owned by a Turkish American businessman close to top Turkish officials according to people familiar with the matterThe Flynn Intel Group was paid for research on Fethullah Gulen a cleric who Turkeys current president believes was responsible for a coup attempt last summer Flynn retroactively registered with the Justice Department in March as a paid foreign agent for Turkish interests Separately from the probe now run by Mueller Flynn is being investigated by the Pentagons top watchdog for his foreign payments Flynn also received $45000 to appear in 2015 with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a dinner for RT a Kremlin-controlled media organization Flynn discussed US sanctions against Russia with Russias ambassador to the United States during the month before Trump took office and he withheld that fact from the vice president That prompted then-acting attorney general Sally Yates to  Flynn  after The Washington Post reported on the contents of the call The president has nonetheless seemed to defend his former adviser A memo by Comey alleged that Trump asked that the probe into Flynn be shut down   The White House also has acknowledged that Kushner met with Kislyak the Russian ambassador to the United States in late November Kushner also has acknowledged that he met with the head of a Russian development bank Vnesheconombank which has been under US sanctions since July 2014 The presidents son-in-law  though his lawyer has said publicly he submitted the form prematurely and informed the FBI soon after that he would provide an update Vnesheconombank handles development for the state and in early 2015 a man purporting to be one of its New York-based employees was arrested and accused of being an unregistered spyThat man  Evgeny Buryakov  ultimately pleaded guilty and was eventually deported He had been in contact with former Trump adviser Carter Page though Page has said he shared only basic immaterial information and publicly available research documents with the Russian Page was the subject of a secret warrant last year issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court based on suspicions he might have been acting as an agent of the Russian government according to people familiar with the matter Page has denied any wrongdoing and accused the government of violating his civil rights Ellen Nakashima and Ashley Parker contributed to this reportThe facts as laid out in the newly unsealed plea agreement between special counsel Robert S Mueller III and  a former foreign policy adviser to President Trumps campaign do not provide a slam-dunk case that the Trump team was colluding with the Russian government But to a former CIA officer like me everything Papadopoulos admitted in the plea deal looks consistent with the modus operandi of the Russian intelligence services engaged in an active measures covert operation So what might the Russians have been up to with PapadopoulosSince late last year when the US intelligence community issued a  on Russian involvement in the campaign it is clear that the Russian government was intent on influencing the outcome of the election on Trumps behalf Trump had already stated policy positions that were much more favorable to Russia than Hillary Clinton or the Obama administrations stances  he had questioned NATOs relevance played down Russias annexation of Crimea contemplated reviewing Western sanctions on Russia and so forth So helping Trump would be a reasonable Russian covert action goal Over the past months several elements of this wide-ranging operation have emerged such as the extensive use of propaganda from Russian-sponsored news media (for example RT and Sputnik) and the  such as Facebook Google and Twitter in an attempt to influence US voters The Russian   and the subsequent release of thousands of stolen emails  has raised the specter of even more involved Russian cyber operations and it is still not entirely clear how far the Russians may have gotten into actual voting machines and voter registrations databases at the state levelAnd with Mondays news we now have greater clarity on yet another part of the Russian operation how a Trump foreign policy aide was lured into contact with Moscow The Papadopoulos indictment tells a story containing several elements consistent with how Russian intelligence (and in this case most likely the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service the SVR) operates According to the indictment Papadopoulos was living in London when an as-yet-unidentified professor there became interested in Papadopoulos after learning that he had a foreign policy role in Trumps campaign Papadopoulos in turn became interested in the professors claimed Moscow contacts and the two apparently communicated substantially in pursuit of this mutual interest  The use of a professor  not a Russian government official that would come later  as first a spotter and later an intermediary to Moscow makes operational sense from the perspective of Russian intelligence Clearly Papadopoulos in his role as a foreign policy adviser had access to information of interest to the Russians making an approach to him worthwhile As an added advantage he was outside the United States further away from the prying eyes of the FBI Using a professor as a cutout to gain access to Papadopoulos would have increased the aides comfort level and minimized the chance of scaring him away from contact As it turned out though the cutout wasnt necessary to gain the targets trust Papadopoulos wasnt worried at all about the prospect of meeting with Russian operativesNext the professor offered Papadopoulos concrete contacts in Moscow specifically with the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) as well as with an unidentified woman with senior contacts in the Kremlin This is consistent with the incremental approach to a relationship like this that Russian intelligence typically favors Having made Papadopoulos comfortable with a cutout in an overseas environment the Russians then tried to lay the groundwork for contact with actual members of the Russian government Russian intelligence often uses the MFA as cover for its work which underscores the importance of the meeting Papadopoulos was offered with the ministry The official story for such a meeting would have plausible deniability another earmark of a good Russian operation The topic of any meetings between the Trump campaign and the MFA could simply be how to get a head-start on planning for improvement of the US-Russia relationship after the electionThe proposal of contact with the unidentified Russian woman  who Papadopoulos later told investigators he initially thought was a niece of Putins  was a further escalation of the operation The MFA is an official entity but this unidentified woman with nebulous but important contacts inside Moscow power structures is a bit more shadowy and covert in nature Meeting with an official Russian diplomatic entity has at least the patina of normalcy candidates and aides do sometimes meet with foreign officials during campaigns Contrast that to meeting with a woman whose identity and position are not clear but who is promised to be of consequence in Moscow The scenario now starts to become sketchier But the Russians may have already assessed by then that Papadopoulos would be intrigued rather than spooked Perhaps intelligence officials believed or hoped Papadopoulos was moving up in the Trump campaign given that he contacted more senior members of the campaign several times offering to arrange the meetingsUp until early April 2016 the ostensible purpose of the contacts proposed by Papadopoulos was simply to establish an initial relationship with Russian officials to improve relations between the countries But by late April the Russians took the next step in the operation by offering dirt on Clinton  dirt in the form of stolen emails even though news of the DNC hack wouldnt become public for several more months If Russian intelligence officers were worried that taking this step brought increased risk  which any intelligence professional would be trained to consider  they neednt have been concerned Again Papadopoulos continued to advocate for Trump campaign officials to meet with the Russians well after hearing the offer of derogatory information on Clinton Indeed in June Papadopoulos indicated he would be happy to make an off the record trip to meet the Russians himself According to his plea agreement Papadopouloss still-unidentified supervisor in the campaign replied I would encourage you (to)  make the trip if it is feasible  All that may not add up to legal proof But from a counterintelligence standpoint a sound case can be made that the identification and slow courting of Papadopoulos by the Russians initially using a professor with Russian government contacts to arrange foreign policy meetings then later morphing into a mechanism to share damaging information on Clinton was part of Russias larger 2016 operation However like most good Russian operations this one built a strong element of deniability into the construct The Russian government can easily say that it did have contact with some members of candidate Trumps foreign policy team but only in support of future foreign policy planning if their past statements are any guide they will label any other analysis as American Russophobia or Cold War-era thinking They will simply deny any claim that Russia was trying to pass Clinton dirt to the Trump campaignRussians will of course denounce all of this new information as conspiracy theories The Russian government knows that Americans believe strongly in such Western values as hearing out all sides of an argument trying to be fair to all sides and telling the truth Russia takes great advantage of this and will inevitably try to sow doubt and cast aspersions We never interfere with the internal affairs of other countries least of all the United States Russian officials will say More fabrication on the part of the US press unfairly targeting Russia state-owned media will crow Great umbrage and offense will be taken by Russian officials who will continue to demand the respect that a great power deserves Americans should remember that all of that is also part of the Russians active measures operation against us and that there is probably more to comeMOSCOW When Russia faces uncomfortable accusations from abroad the Kremlin normally lashes back with official declarations andscornful comments on state televisionBut when the Democratic National Committee and cybersecurity experts told The Washington Post that Russian government hackers had  of opposition research on presumptive GOPpresidential nomineeDonald Trumpofficials here met the accusations with little more than a simple denial and a shrugUsually these kinds of leaks take place not because hackers broke in but as any professional will tell you because someone simply forgot the password or set the simple

in a curt statement  Western officials have accused Russia of conducting a campaign of high-profilehacking attacks that have included cyberattacks in 2007 against Estonia a 2014 assault on Ukraines power grid and a breach of the White Houses unclassified email server last year The latest revelations risked plunging the Kremlin into the midst of a heated USelectioncycle that has captured the attention of aMoscow eliteeager for change in WashingtonOver the years theKremlin has grown used to brushing off these kinds of accusations Reports of hackinghave become ubiquitous  director of the Carnegie Moscow Centerand a former Russian army officer said by telephone I dont think that its something they willbe reallytalking much about or worried aboutMost state television channels through whichthe vast majority of Russians get their information did not air reports on the allegationsSome of the few official comments posted online by Russian news agencies were dismissiveRussian officials have addressed the US elections sparingly Putin has offeredguarded praise forTrumpcalling him lively and talented duringa nationally televised news conference in December But on the whole the Russian leaderhas stayed silent on the US presidential raceFyodor Lukyanov a well-connected political analyst in Moscow andthe editor of Russia in Global Affairs a foreign policy journal said that there is great interest in the US elections amongRussian elites and that many see Trump aspotentiallya betterpartner for Russia than Hillary ClintonI dont see why they would be interested in doing this which would just electrify the campaign of the Democratic candidate Lukyanov said noting that he wasnt briefed on the specifics of the hackingcase I think in the case of these reports that many people are just used to seeing the scary ghost of Mr PutinTrenin echoed that thought I would be suspicious that that would be a target of importance to foreign intelligence he said The DNC is a soft target compared withthe National Security Council he added They would likely spend their resources elsewhere Then again I dont knowEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt hinted Tuesday at plans to rid the agencys scientific advisory boards of researchers who get EPA grants arguing that the current structureraises questions about their independenceWhats most important at the agency is to have scientific advisers that are objective independent-minded providing transparent recommendations Pruitt  at the conservative Heritage Foundation If we have individuals who are on those boards sometimes receiving money from the agency  that to me causes questions on the independence and the veracity and the transparency of those recommendations that are coming our wayPruitt promised to fix that in a directive he plans to issue next week It remained unclear Tuesday what such a directive would sayThe EPA declined further commentThe administratorsremarks drew rapid criticism from scientific and environmental groups who called the move a veiled attempt to purge scientists from advisory boards in favor of more industry representativesPruitts purge has a single goal get rid of scientists who tell us the facts about threats to our environment and healthJennifer Sass a senior scientist for theNatural Resources Defense Council said in a statement Theres a reason he wont apply the same limits to scientists funded by corporate polluters Now the only scientists on Pruitts good list will be those with funding from polluters supporting Trumps agenda to make America toxic againMichael Halpern deputy director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists wrote in a blog post that if Pruitt issues the kind of directive he promised he would be willfully setting himself up to fail at the job of protecting public health and the environmentWhile experts from chemical oil and gas and other industries have traditionally served on these EPA boards industry groups have that it can be difficult for them to get adequate representationHalpern said industrymembership on the agencys Science Advisory Board is fine as long as individuals are evaluated for their scientific expertise and their ability to remain objective But he called Pruitts complaints about scientists who receive EPA grants a double standardSo lets recap According to some scientists who receive money from oil and chemical companies are perfectly qualified to provide the EPA with independent science advice while those who receive federal grants are not he wrote Its a fundamental misrepresentation of how conflicts of interest workThe EPA in recent months has solicited candidates for positions on its influential Science Advisory BoardThe panel had 47 members as of last month before terms for 15 expired Alistof 132 possible candidates for board positions published by the agency included numerous people who have questioned mainstream research about the causes and severity of climate changeOne candidate has stated that more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will confer great benefits upon future inhabitants of the globe by drivingplant growth Another has faulted the climate change debate saying scare tactics and junk science are used to secure lucrative government contracts Several others havechallengedthe EPAsown science on the warming of the planet in courtEarlier this year the EPA gavenotice to dozens ofscientists on a separate advisory panel that their positions would not be renewed for another term leading critics to charge that the administration was politicizing the agency and its scienceSen Claire McCaskill jumped on  that Attorney General Jeff Sessions in 2016 had met twice with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak including once in his Senate office whenSessions was a key adviser to Donald Trumps presidential campaignIve been on the Armed Services Com for 10 yearsNo call or meeting w/Russian ambassador Ever Ambassadors call members of Foreign Rel Com Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) But now some of her earlier tweets have undermined that claimHere are tweets that McCaskill sent out in 2013 and 2015Off to meeting w/Russian Ambassador Upset about the arbitrary/cruel decision to end all US adoptionseven those in process Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) Today calls with British Russian and German Ambassadors re Iran deal  Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) Thats certainly different fromher claims of no call or meeting with the Russian ambassador ever over the course of 10 yearsThe senators spokesman John LaBombard argued there was a differencebetween the meetings Sessions met privately with Kislyak whereas McCaskills meeting was part of a group He also said that McCaskill called Kislyak rather than the other way around She did attend a group meeting about adoptions with other senators and had a brief proactive call with the ambassador amid calls to several other parties to the Iran nuclear deal Lombardsaid()By contrast LaBombard said Attorney General Sessions met one-on-one with the Russian ambassador in the midst of a Russian cyber campaign against the US and then misled the Judiciary Committee under oath about that meeting He then tried to excuse it by saying it was part of the normal course of his Armed Services Committee workOne of Sessions interactions with the ambassador was as part of a group  in July at the Republican National Convention after Sessions gave a speech at an event for about 50 ambassadors sponsored by the Heritage Foundation Sessions then spoke individually to some of the ambassadors including KislyakThe second Sessions meeting is more sensitive but details are not clear It took place in his Senate office on Sept 8 but its unknown whether aides were present It is also not knownif Kislyak or Sessions initiated the meeting A spokeswoman for Sessions characterized it as a meeting done as part of Sessionsswork on the Senate Armed Services Committee not as a Trump campaign surrogate She said that Sessions had more than 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors in 2016In a statement issued Wednesday night Sessions said that he never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign I have no idea what this allegation is about It is falseMcCaskill went too far to suggest that she had never met or had a phone call with the Russian ambassador in the last 10years especially given that she had tweeted about such interactions in the past Certainly the circumstances of the Sessions-Kislyak meeting in September raise questions  as do his answers under oath during his confirmation hearing  but McCaskill undercuts her outrage by making such misleading statementsIf the full explanation doesnt fit in 140 characters

Post users as a group or the general populationSouth Korea has suspended the deployment of a controversial American missile defense system with the new liberal administration declaring that no further moves can take place until an environmental assessment is carried out  a process that could take a year or even twoThe decision highlights the potential for a rift between the United States under President Trump and South Korea with its who is due to visit the White House later this month for their first meetingMoons office Wednesday said it would suspend the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) system The antimissile battery is designed to protect the South against North Korea but it has elicited strong opposition particularly where it is being deployedThe US Army to South Korea ahead of Moons anticipated victory in a snap presidential election last month Moon vowed to review the previous governments decision to host the systemTwo launchers and the powerful X-band radar were already in place before his victory on May 9 but Moon expressed outrage last week when it emerged that four more launchers had been brought into the country without his knowledge  A full THAAD battery contains six launchers mounted on trucks each capable of firing eight interceptor missiles But Moons office accused an official in the Defense Ministry of deliberately failing to tell the presidents staff about the arrival of the final four launchers Moon called the omission very shocking and ordered an investigation A deputy defense minister was suspended as a resultAn official from the presidents office said Wednesday that the missile defense system would be frozen as it isWe are not saying the two launchers and other equipment that has already been deployed should be withdrawn But those that have yet to be deployed will have to wait a senior official told reporters in Seoul according to the Yonhap News AgencyGary Ross a Pentagon spokesman suggested that the deployment should be above politicsThe US trusts the [South Korean] official stance that the THAAD deployment was an Alliance decision and it will not be reversed Ross said We will continue to work closely with the [South Korean] government throughout this processThe president has ordered a full-blown environmental impact assessment of the deployment on the grounds of a former golf course in the southern area of SeongjuThe unnamed official said the assessment could take at least a year or perhaps two noting that a similar evaluation for a THAAD deployment in Guam had taken 23 months Yonhap reported  But there was no hurry to get the system up and running given that North Korea has been a threat to the South for years the official said[North Koreas] nuclear tests have been going on for a long time and so whether we must urgently install [the THAAD battery] by ignoring our legal procedures is a question he saidNorth Korea has been test-firing missiles in quick succession recently apparently part of an avowed plan to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the mainland United StatesAs if to underline the threat North Korea launched a salvo of missiles Thursday morning although they appeared to be cruise missiles rather than the ballistic missiles it has been firing recentlyNorth Korea fired multiple unidentified projectiles assumed to be surface-to-ship missiles this morning from the vicinity of Wonsan South Koreas Joint Chiefs of Staff said Thursday according to local media Most of the previous launches have been medium- or intermediate-range missiles that can reach all parts of South Korea The THAAD system was deployed to intercept those missiles but it has greatly angered Beijing which is concerned that its powerful radar will be used to spy on ChinaSpecial counsel Robert S Mueller III is investigating the finances and business dealings of Jared Kushner President Trumps son-in-law and adviser as part of the investigation into Russias interference in the 2016 presidential election according to US officials familiar with the matterFBI agents and federal prosecutors have also been examining the financial dealings of other Trump associates including former national security adviser Michael Flynn former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Carter Page who was listed as a foreign-policy adviser for the campaignThe Washington Post previously reported that investigators were scrutinizing meetings that Kushner held with Russians in December  first with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak and then with Sergey Gorkov the head of a state-owned Russian development bank At the time of that report it was not clear that the FBI was investigating Kushners business dealingsThe officials who described the financial focus of the investigation spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publiclyAt the December meeting with Kislyak  between Trump officials and the Kremlin at a Russian diplomatic facility according to US officials who reviewed intelligence reports describing Kislyaks accountThe White House has said that the subsequent meeting with the banker was a pre-inauguration diplomatic encounter unrelated to business matters The Russian bank  which has been the subject of US sanctions following Russias annexation of Crimea has said the session was held for business reasons because of Kushners role as head of his familys real estate company The meeting occurred as Kushners company was seeking financing for its troubled $18billion purchase of an office building on Fifth Avenue in New York and it could raise questions about whether Kushners personal financial interests were colliding with his impending role as a public officialMuellers investigation is in a relatively early phase and it is unclear whether criminal charges will be brought when it is completeWe do not know what this report refers to Jamie Gorelick an attorney for Kushner said in an email It would be standard practice for the Special Counsel to examine financial records to look for anything related to Russia Mr Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about Russia-related matters He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiryKushner has agreed to discuss his Russian contacts with the Senate Intelligence Committee which is conducting one of several investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 electionKushner rarely speaks publicly about his role in the White House but he has become a major figure in the administration with a sprawling list of policy responsibilities that includes Canada and Mexico China and peace in the Middle EastPeter Carr a spokesman for Mueller declined to comment for this article but said that the Special Counsels Office has undertaken stringent controls to prohibit unauthorized disclosures and will deal severely with any member who engages in this conduct  Mueller who was appointed as special counsel by Deputy Attorney General Rod J Rosenstein on May 17 is investigating possible coordination between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election and related matters The inquiry has expanded to include an examination of whether Trump attempted to obstruct justice The Post reported WednesdayTrump on Thursday tweeted that the investigation was the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history  led by some very bad and conflicted peopleTrump compared his position with the investigation of Hillary Clintons use of a private email server in another tweetCrooked H destroyed phones w/ hammer bleached emails & had husband meet w/AG days before she was cleared  & they talk about obstruction he wroteAfter Trump fired FBI Director James B Comey Trump said that Comey had told him three times that he was not under investigation Comey confirmed that in his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee last week Thefirst time he told Trump was in his first meeting with the then-president-elect before the inauguration on Jan 6Before he met with Trump Comey gathered his leadership team at the FBI to discuss whether he should be prepared to assure the president-elect that the FBI was not investigating him personallyComey testified that not everyone on his team agreed he should Comey did not name the dissenter but The Post has learned it was FBI general counsel James A Baker Comey testified that the member of his leadership team said that although it was true at the moment that Trump was not under investigation it was possible that could changeHis concern was because were looking at the potential  again thats the subject of the investigation  coordination between the campaign and Russia because it was President Trump  President-elect Trumps campaign this persons view was inevitably his behavior his conduct will fall within the scope of that work Comey saidAnd so he was reluctant to make the statement that I made Comey saidBakers views did not change even as Comey told Trump a second and third time that he was not being investigatedHis view was still that it  could be misleading because the nature of the investigation was such that it might well touch  obviously it would touch the campaign and the person at the head of the campaign would be the candidate And so that was his view throughout Comey saidBaker declined to commentIn the days following Trumps firing of Comey on May 9 and before Muellers appointment the obstruction-of-justice investigation of the president began according to people familiar with the matterDiscussing the firing of Comey Trump said in an interview with NBC In fact when I decided to just do it I said to myself I said You know this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story Its an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have wonComey took notes after each of his nine meetings or phone calls with Trump including one alone with the president in the Oval Office on Feb 14 the day after Flynn was forced to resign Comey testified that Trump said to him I hope you can let this go The president has denied that he told Comey to drop the Flynn investigationComey told lawmakers he gave his notes to MuellerTwo senior intelligence officials Daniel Coats the director of national intelligence and Mike Rogers the head of the National Security Agency agreed to be interviewed by Mueller as early as this weekTrump spoke to Coats and Rogers about the Russia investigation according to officials Coats told associates that Trump asked him whether he could intervene with Comey to get the FBI to back off its focus on Flynn the officials said Coats later told lawmakers he did not feel pressured to intervene  Trump later telephoned Coats and Rogers to separately ask them to issue public statements denying that there was evidence of coordination between Trumps campaign and Russian officials Coats and Rogers refused to comply with the presidents requests officials said Ellen Nakashima contributed to this reportThe material in the  that emerged this week has been  and the president-elect himself derided the report as fake news However at least some inthe US intelligence community believed that the source of the report was credible and with the recent unmasking of that sources identity has come a basis for that credibilityThe man behind the dossier is a former British spy Christopher Steele who is now a corporate intelligence consultant In 2010 Steele helped deliver information about FIFA to the FBI that eventually led to indictments of many current and former officials of the soccer governing body as well as the ouster of longtime FIFA president Sepp Blatter  Reuters reported Thursday that it had viewed emails showing that Steele met with members of the FBIsEurasian Organized Crime squad The ex-spys London-based consulting firm  had

trip to Latin America and needed a big planeFor Frank Giustra who had never met the former president this was an opportunity The Canadian mining magnate and onetime Hollywood studio owner stepped up to let the former president borrow his luxurious passenger jet There was just one condition Giustra would come along for the rideThat 2005 trip was the start of an intense mutually beneficial friendship  one that has helped propel the Clinton Foundation into a global giant and established Giustras reputation as an international philanthropist while helping him build connections in countries where his business was expandingGiustra has since committed more than $100 million to the work of the Clinton Foundation becoming one of the largest individual donors to the familys charitiesClinton has also gained regular transportation borrowing Giustras plane 26 times for foundation business since 2005 including 13 trips in which the two men traveled together The numbers on Clintons use of the plane never previously reported were provided by a spokeswoman for GiustraThe relationship has gained attention as Hillary Rodham Clinton has launched her presidential campaign amid questions about whether the Clinton Foundation has served as an avenue for wealthy interests to gain entree to a powerful familyGiustra 57 a Vancouver BC-based mogul whose eclectic business interests include founding Lionsgate Entertainment and investing in gold mines and an olive oil company has come to symbolize a relatively new but substantial category of Clinton backers foreign donors who are not legally eligible to contribute to US political candidates but grew close to the Clintons through the charity  In a rare interview Giustra told The Washington Post recently that his friendship with Bill Clinton has grown entirely out of their shared interest in philanthropy  not businessI have one very specific reason I have a relationship with Bill Clinton I admire what he does and I want to be part of it Giustra said But Ive never asked him for a damn thingBut Giustras donations and others from his friends in the international mining business are becoming a factor in Hillary Clintons campaignLast week the Clinton Foundation acknowledged that an affiliated Canadian charity founded in 2007 by Giustra kept its donors secret despite a 2008 ethics agreement with the Obama administration promising to reveal the New York-based foundations donorsThe foundation said the arrangement conformed with Canadian law But it also opened a way for anonymous donors including foreign executives with business pending before the Hillary Clinton-led State Department to direct money to the Clinton Foundation  For Giustra the partnership with Bill Clinton provided an introduction to the world of international philanthropy at the highest levels  a feel-good reputation-enhancing effort that he said he finds more personally satisfying than amassing wealthAt the same time Giustra continued to expand his business empire closing some of the biggest deals of his career in the same countries where he traveled with ClintonIn one case he finalized a massive transaction to buy uranium mines in Kazakhstan days after dining with that nations president along with Clinton and about 50 other guests In another a Colombian oil operation he helped form received valuable drilling rights in deals involving a state-owned oil company that went through a few years after he met the Colombian president through the Clinton Foundation Giustra said government approval was not required in either case  Giustra and Bill Clinton first met on June 5 2005 after Giustras plane touched down at the White Plains NY airport  the closest airfield to the Clinton home in Chappaqua  to pick up the former president and ferry him to Arkansas and then on to Mexico Colombia and BrazilThe airplane quickly became a core element of the new friendship between business mogul and political iconThe MD-87 aircraft is a full-size passenger jetliner with comfortable seating areas and a private bedroom The doors have gold-colored fixtures and an art collection hangs on the wallsMembers of Bill Clintons inner circle are constantly on the lookout for private aircraft to carry the ex-president and his team with the security and efficiency required by someone of his stature according to several people familiar with the process  Giustra said he and Clinton got along immediatelyClinton spotted the biography of Julius Caesar that Giustra was carrying He began talking about the book quoting whole passages of it from memory Giustra recalledThat kind of broke the ice Giustra said Then he asked me about my background He asked me how I grew up So I started telling him my life storyGiustra said the two related to each other because of their similarly humble beginningsNo money he said referring to his childhood I think we both worked very hard to achieve what we wanted to achieve I think he kind of respected that and we hit it off right awayFrom that first four-day trip to a nine-day visit to Africa in 2006 to a three-day trip to Colombia last summer the two men came to know each other wellAll the while Giustra kept an eye on businessHe finalized the Kazakhstan deal in September 2005 after joining Clinton in Almaty the former capital for the launch of a foundation health initiative endorsed by the countrys iron-fisted president Nursultan NazarbayevThe $500 million purchase of Kazakh uranium mines among the most productive in the world followed months of negotiations Giustra said insisting that it was finalized without any help from the Clintons  Giustra had flown there days before Bill Clintons arrival and the transaction received preliminary approval days after Clinton left  provoking questions about whether Clinton had assisted The connection was  in 2008 by the New York TimesGiustra said Clinton had zero to do with the deal saying it was about to close anyway when the two men met in AlmatyClinton has said that he was aware of Giustras pending purchase while in Kazakhstan but did not discuss it or do anything to help its progressThat account is supported by a longtime Clinton aide Amed Khan who said that he was at Clintons side during every meeting with Kazakh officials and that a discussion of Giustras business never happenedGiustra said it was beyond ludicrous to suggest that Clinton engaged on the deal in part because the former president has very little interest in businessYou have to understand something about Bill Clinton He doesnt care about that stuff Giustra said His eyes would glaze overFollowing the deal Giustras new company UrAsia was considered one of Canadas hottest new mining ventures The next year Giustra made a $327million donation to the Clinton FoundationIn 2007 Giustra sold UrAsia to a company called Uranium One chaired by an old friend Ian Telfer Giustra who had retained stock in the company sold nearly all of his interests shortly after that Still Giustra and Telfer are a focus of the soon-to-be-released book  because of their role in the firm which several years later was sold to a Russian state-owned companyThe sale gave the Russians control of uranium deposits around the world including several mines in the United States That sale was reviewed by the State Department and other agencies at the time Hillary Clinton was secretary of state Some Republicans have charged that this was a conflict of interest though aides to Clinton have said she did not personally intervene in the approval process and showed no favoritism toward foundation donorsA few weeks after returning from Kazakhstan in 2005 Giustra attended his first meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative in New YorkThere he was introduced to the leader of another country where he had business interests lvaro Uribe of ColombiaGiustras interests in Colombia included gold mines port construction timber and more recently oil production Some of the companies he joined or formed have drawn protests from environmental human rights and labor groups Giustra said he was not aware of complaints against the companies

Uribe Clinton and Giustra  have been in multiple meetings together in New York Bogota and the Clinton family home in ChappaquaIn 2007 Giustra played a key role in forming a fast-growing oil company operating in Colombia Pacific Rubiales Energy It burst onto the scene that year by purchasing control of an oil production firm that worked closely with the Colombian state oil company which Uribe had recently privatized It also signed a pipeline deal with that firm and then won the right to explore for oil in environmentally sensitive areas along the Colombian coastAspects of Giustras ties to Colombia are discussed in Clinton Cash the book by conservative author Peter Schweizer due out this week and were  by the International Business Times Some information from those accounts and additional details of Giustras activities were confirmed through independent reporting by The PostThe Colombia connections of the Clintons and their patron Giustra were evident in June 2010Bill Clinton and Giustra had flown in together on the businessmans jet while Hillary Clinton had arrived for an official visit as secretary of state The three dined together in Bogota The next morning Bill Clinton met privately with Uribe at the presidential houseA few hours later Hillary Clinton held her own meeting with the Colombian leader In a subsequent televised interview she announced that she was inclined to support a much-sought-after free-trade deal with Colombia  a reversal in position since her 2008 presidential campaignHillary Clinton was adhering to Obama administration policy Her campaign press secretary Brian Fallon pointed out that then-Secretary Clintons statements in support of the deal reflected the Presidents positionNevertheless top Colombian leaders and their business allies were thrilled with the news that day from BogotaGiustra said the free-trade deal did not come up during his dinner with the Clintons He said his relationship with Hillary Clinton is cordial but not especially close We talk about my kids We talk about how lovely Vancouver is he saidOfficials with the Giustra partnership say it has funded thousands of cataract surgeries in Peru and provided meals for low-income children Recently Giustra said the effort has focused on helping people in Colombia and other developing countries find markets for goods they can make or grow at home resulting in permanent jobs for people in povertyBack home in Vancouver people who have worked with Giustra on charitable efforts describe him in near-saintly terms saying he is sincere when he says he became involved in the Clinton Foundation to alleviate poverty around the worldAmong the local efforts he funds is an organization that provides mentoring for at-risk teenage boys in British Columbia It once helped put a former gang member through college on the condition that the boy meet with Giustra every few weeks to provide updates on his progress said Jim Crescenzo a Vancouver teacher who helped found the programWhile Giustra had been involved in Canadian charitable efforts since the 1990s in his own telling it was meeting Bill Clinton in 2005 that caused his interest to explodeHeres a guy

international practice Russia has reasons to respond in kind Putin says Although we have the right to retaliate we will not resort to irresponsible kitchen diplomacy but will plan our further steps to restore Russian-US relations based on the policies of the Trump Administration Putins announcement is made in the afternoon of Dec 30 or morning in the United StatesPresident-elect Trump tweets approvingly and pins the tweet at the top of his Twitter page The White House insists that Trump had no prior knowledge of Flynns conversations about sanctions with KislyakGreat move on delay (by V Putin)  I always knew he was very smart Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) The Washington Posts David Ignatius  that Flynn and Kislyak spoke around the time of sanctions announcement According to a senior US government official Flynn phoned Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak several times on Dec 29 the day the Obama administration announced the expulsion of 35 Russian officials as well as other measures in retaliation for the hacking What did Flynn say and did it undercut the US sanctionsIncoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer in a conference call with reporters denies that sanctions were discussed The conversation between Flynn and Kislyak had centered on the logistics of a post-inauguration call between Trump and Putin That was it plain and simple Spicer saysVice President-elect Mike Pence and Flynn have a conversation in which Pence says Flynn assured him that the conversations that took place at that time were not in any way related to the new US sanctions against Russia or the expulsion of diplomats according to an account Pence later gave Fox News SundayPence during an appearance on CBSs Face the Nation denies that sanctions were discussed Saying he had spoken about the issue with Flynn Pence says the incoming national security adviser and Kislyak did not discuss anything having to do with the United States decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against RussiaPence adds General Flynn has been in touch with diplomatic leaders security leaders in some 30 countries Thats exactly what the incoming national security adviser should do But what I can confirm having spoken to him about it is that those conversations that happened to occur around the time that the United States took action to expel diplomats had nothing whatsoever to do with those sanctionsMeanwhile incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus on NBCs Meet the Press says I have talked to General Flynn None of that came up and the subject matter of sanctions or the actions taken by the Obama administration did not come up in the conversationTrump takes the oath of office and becomes presidentSpicer in his first official newsbriefing again is asked about Flynns communications with Kislyak Spicer says that he had talked to Flynn about the issue again last night There was just one call Spicer says adding that it covered four subjects a plane crash that claimed the lives of a Russian military choir Christmas greetings Russian-led talks over the Syrian civil war and the logistics of setting up a call between Putin and Trump Spicer insists that was the extent of the conversationFlynn is interviewed by the FBI about his conversations with KislyakActing Attorney General Sally Yates accompanied by an aide goes to the White House and tells White House counsel Don McGahn that contrary to Flynns claims to White House officials sanctions had been discussed in the calls based on the monitoring of the conversations by intelligence agencies She also warns that Flynn is vulnerable to blackmailWe also told the White House counsel that General Flynn had been interviewed by the FBI on February [] 24 Yates said in congressional testimony on May 8 Mr McGahn asked me how he did and I declined to give him an answer to that And we then walked through with Mr McGahn essentially why we were telling them about this and the first thing we did was to explain to Mr McGahn that the underlying conduct that General Flynn had engaged in was problematic in and of itself Secondly we told him we felt like the vice president and others were entitled to know that the information that they were conveying to the American people wasnt trueThe president was immediately informed of the situation Spicer told reporters on Feb 14 after Flynns departure The White House counsel determined that Flynn would have broken no laws in his discussions Spicer adds The White House has not disclosedthe length or depth of the counsels inquiry into that question except to say it was extensive and took daysMcGahn asks Yates to come to the White House again to discuss the matter further Yates testified that he did not indicate whether he had discussed the Flynn situation with anyone else at the White House He asked why the Justice Department would be concerned whether one White House official lied to another she said Logic would tell you that you dont want the national security adviser to be in a position where the Russians have leverage over him she saidMcGahn also asks to see the underlying evidence Yates says she would work with the FBI to assemble the material and McGahns review is scheduled for Jan 30Trump fires Yates allegedly over an unrelated matter  her conclusion that Trumps executive order barring travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries is unlawful The executive order is later blocked by the courtsThe Washington Post citing nine sources  that Flynn had discussed sanctions in the phone calls Flynn initially denied he had discussed sanctions in an interview with The Post but then amendedhis comment He indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions he couldnt be certain that the topic never came up not until The Posts report appeared did the vice president learn that Flynn had given him false information about his contacts with Kislyak So according to the White Houses account Trump had known of the Flynns false statements for two weeks but had not informed Pence Trump asked about the media reports about Flynn suggests it is news to him I dont know about that I havent seen it What report is that I havent seen that Ill look into that Spicer later says Trump was saying he had not seen the specific report in The Post not that he was unaware that Flynn had spoken toKislyak about sanctions The Post  that the White House had known for weeks that Flynn had misled about the nature of the calls Flynn is forced to resign within hours after the article is posted Spicer on Feb 14 said Flynn was let go because he no longer had the trust of the president and vice president()FORT BRAGGNC  The military judge who will determine whether Bowe Bergdahl goes to prison heard testimony Thursday from current troops and veterans who said the Army sergeants 2009 disappearance in Afghanistan led to severe injuries among those requiredto search for him lasting fallout that could become a factor in any sentence he receivesWitnesses described a missionduring the early morning of July 9 days after Bergdahl disappeared It called for US and Afghanpersonnel to fan out across remote villages in Paktikaprovinceto gather intelligence from local leaders about Bergdahlscaptors or possible locationThe team of six US troops and nearly 50 Afghans were attacked by machine gun and rocket propelled grenade fire leaving several seriously wounded including one soldier who was shot in the headIn the weeks that followed the massive search effort would involve thousands of troopsThese injuries are central to the prosecutions argument that by abandoning his post Bergdahl now 31 created greater danger for US troops deployed toeastern Afghanistan He was captured by the Taliban a short time later and ultimately spent five years in captivity enduring brutal treatment that has left him permanently injured as wellThe Obama White House secured his release in a controversial prisoner exchange in 2014Bergdahl pleaded guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy with the latter charge carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonmentThe judge Army Col Jeffery R Nance also is expected to rule on a motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that President Trump who has referred to Bergdahl as a dirty rotten traitorto impartial proceedings  Former infantrymanJonathan Marita told Nance that during their search for Bergdahl an unexploded rocket propelled grenade warhead struck his rifle nearlysevering his right thumb Pieces of the weapon were found several feet awayI thought I was

skull-and-crossbones belt buckle departedthe stand and shot an angry glance to the defenseMaritasleft hand  his good hand  was balled and tightenedBergdahls attorneys have pointed to phrases long uttered by US troops The enemy gets a vote and their own decisions affect what happens in combat And commanders whoexecutedmissions that were hastily planned or improperly resourced should shoulder

Berghdals actions allowing their testimony to be used in Berghdals sentencingStaff Sgt Justin Walters a National Guardsman on the mission testified he saw the moment Allen was hitI watched just as a cloud of his blood came out the side of his head Walters said pausing as emotion overcame him on the stand while recallinghis efforts to treat AllenI was telling him to hang on  The defense questioned Walters and others about training and lack of detailed preparation for troops on the mission underscoring the potential factors that could have played a role in the outcome Air Force Lt Col John Marx led the mission as an intelligence officer He was not trained in infantry tactics he testifiedThe prosecution played a video Marx took on the mission before the attack to highlight the relevance of Bergdahl to the mission But it also revealed the simmering resentment many troops felt about the exhaustive search to find himAll for a dude who decided to walk off Marx narrated in a short clip of the Afghan skyline Good timesJared Kushner  as the senior White House adviser who is under investigation in the Russia probe  which is news that comes as little surprise Indeed when The Washington Post reported last week that  many quickly assumed it was KushnerBut while those assumptions were based on his knowncontacts with Russians and his status as one of few senior White House aides theres another reason his naming fits the puzzleHes related to TrumpKushners ability to even work in the White House has been the  because he is Trumps son-in-law (Kushner has made concessions to try and avoid violating a federal anti-nepotism law including forgoing a paycheck) And a big reason anti-nepotism laws exist is to avoid the corruption that all too often comes with installing your relatives in positions of power As any expert on corrupt authoritarian regimes throughout history will tell you those regimes wrongdoing will often run through family members with official titlesIt isnt clear whatpossible crimes might be under investigation and its important to emphasize that Kushner hasnt been charged with anything We dont know where this will lead if anywhereBut heres a key part of In addition to possible coordination between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election investigators are also looking broadly into possible financial crimes  but the people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly did not specify who or what was being examinedIn other words this isnt just about whether Kushner or anyone else facilitated collusion with Russia during the 2016 campaign indeed the two meetings he had with Russians that have been spotlighted actually came in December  Trump was elected Federal investigators appear to be cluing on some other potential crimes that may or may not be related to thatKushner met with Russian Ambassdor Sergey Kislyak and then with Sergey Gorkov the head ofVnesheconombankwhich faced US sanctions after Russias annexation of Crimea Beyond that there arent many detailsIf it does lead down a path to corruption allegations though there will be plenty of I-told-you-sosYouve seen it in countries all over the world where theyve appointed family members whether its their son daughter in-laws  it provides for tremendous opportunities for corruption Shruti Shah an international corruption expert at Coalition for Integrity People who want to curry favor find their way to provide favors to family members as a way to get closer to the person in powerAdded Gerald Feierstein a former top State Department official and ambassador to Yemen in the Obama administrationFor many countries and governments certainly in the Gulf in the Middle East they would recognize this pattern immediately  I think that they would find it completely normal that leaders mix personal business interests with government affairs and would use family members in various official responsibilitiesKushner has already come under scrutiny for his family possibly benefiting personallyfrom his proximity to his leader-of-the-free-world father-in-law His sister earlier this month mentioned Kushners advisory role in the White House Former Obama administration ethics counsel Norman L Eisen was among those  And heres what Eisen said when Kushners potential role in the Trump White House first made newsThe problem with it is it sends a message that if you want to have influence in the administration do it through the kids And theres a tradition This is not the first time this has happened Im just shocked its happened in the United StatesIts possible that Kushners familial relationship with Trump is part of the reason hes been subjected to more scrutiny than any other White House adviser in this probe And as emphasized above we have no idea what will come of thisBut if scrutiny of Kushner becomes more intense and there appears to be some validity to it it will reinforce a central reason whyethics experts say these kinds of arrangements are to be avoided in the first placeOn the face of it the Panama Papers dont look good for Russia Reporters investigating thehuge leak of financial datafrom a Panamanian legal firm havesuggested that up to $2 billionin offshore bank accounts could be linked to a circle of friends closely associated with President Vladimir Putin For many this information seems to corroborate what has long been rumored that Putin is corrupt on a huge scale After a few days of silence the Russian presidenthimself has takenaim at the allegationssuggesting they were part of a broader US plot to  But another very different theory is making the rounds in the Russia-watching world In short the theory says that Moscow isnt avictim of aPanama Papers plotInstead perhapsit is the Russians who are behind the leakOkay it sounds far-fetched but this particular ideais especially noteworthy because of who has advanced it Clifford Gaddy aneconomist who works withthe Brookings Institution Gaddy is one of the foremost Western experts on Russias economy and a former adviser to the Russian Finance Ministry in the 1990s Along with Fiona Hill of Brookings he is one of the co-authors of awell-regarded book on the personality of theRussian leader In a blog post published Thursday  Gaddy outlined his thoughts on the matter You should read it all for yourself but Ill break down his idea into fourquick pointsIts a bold claim Gaddy admitted in an email Friday and one that heisnt totally sure of himself Its certainly not a theory hardly even a hypothesis Gaddy wrote adding that it wasmore a suggestion of something that ought to be seriously investigatedEven so this suggestion has caused a bit of a stir in the Russia-watching world Karen Dawisha an academic who also studies Russian corruption closely tweeted Friday that despite her respect for Gaddy his latest idea has failed to convince herIm convinced of everything else Gaddy writes but not this Americans arent n  because US hasDelaware  Karen Dawisha (@Dawisha) Others offered carefully worded praise Russian American journalist Masha Gessen called it excellent conspirology on Facebook while Brian Whitmore of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that Gaddy was trolling the KremlinThere are certainly  of the idea that make a lot of sense For one it seems clear that the $2 billion stuff hasnt really hit Putin hard while some other worldleaders who have fraught relations with Russia -- for exampleand -- are being seriously rocked by their own links to the scandalWhy isnt Putin facing a domestic scandal Well part of it is simply thatPutin is an enormously popular figure in Russia and it would take a seriously enormous financialscandal to really knock him down Additionally many critics arealready surePutin is corrupt  allegations of the Russian presidents wealth go as  which would easily make him the richest man on earth  and itshard to see how therelatively loose links between Putin andthe $2 billion moved through Panama couldreally shift anyones thinking on the matterOf course there are other parts of the idea that dont fit together For one thing whilethe lack of US citizens has been widely noted there are in fact a few American links to the Panama Papers (See this article from ) Its also possible that more names could come out as more scrutiny is given to the vast amounts of data in the leak Or perhaps its justthat Americans prefer tax havens other than Panama (as  US citizens are thought to favormore securehavens such as the Isle of Man the Cayman Islands and Switzerland)Gaddy himself acknowledges all of this However he also says that even if more and more information is found in the leaks hes still always going to wonder what might have been left outHow can we ever know if they are complete So far everyone seems only to be asking what secrets are in the Panama Papers he wrote We should also ask are there secrets [in Mossack Fonsecas original files] that are NOT in the Panama PapersPerhapsafter years of studying Russias information wars its only reasonable to be alittle conspiratorial Gaddy said hesseenhow Putin has used financial secrets to destroy or to control people within RussiaAnd now when he sees financial secrets creating huge problems for world leaders he has to wonder if Putin is back to his old tricks again)Looks like former president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama are putting down deeper roots in Washington After renting  for their post-White House stint the couple have purchased the eight-bedroom nine-and-a-half-bath home for $81 million according to property recordsThe Obamas have said they plan to remain in DC while their younger daughter Sasha finishes high school at Sidwell Friends After leaving the executive mansion in January the family settled into a rental home owned by Bill Clinton press secretary Joe Lockhart and his wife Giovanna Gray Lockhart an8200-square-foot home that was built in 1921 and renovated in 2011The Obamas still own a Georgian-style home in the Hyde Park neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago the city that will house the Obama presidential librarySpokesman Kevin Lewis in a statement said the purchase just made sense for the family Given that President and Mrs Obama will be in Washington for at least another two and a half years it made sense for them to buy a home rather than continuing to rent propertyDC records show that Lockhart sold the home for $81 million to Homefront Holdings LLC which is controlled by the Obamas The deed transfer was recorded on Wednesday Lockhart bought the home in 2014 for $5295 million records showThe $81 million purchase price makes the Obamas new home the second-most expensive in the Kalorama neighborhood behind the $23 million that Jeffrey P Bezos the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post paid for the former Textile MuseumThe Obamas have called the swanky Washington neighborhood (where neighbors include Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner) their home but its really functioned more like a home base for the globe-trotting family The former first couple  for an extended vacation after leaving the White House and alsoWriting for the New Republic in 2009 in a slightly different context Lawrence Lessig  a problem for American politics that has metastasized over the past 12 monthsHis subject was transparency the sharing of information about what the government was doing at a massive scale We are not thinking critically enough about where and when transparency works and where and when it may lead to confusion or to worse he wrote And I fear that the inevitable success of this movement--if pursued alone without any sensitivity to the full complexity of the idea of perfect openness--will inspire not reform but disgust The naked transparency movement as I will call it here is not going to inspire change It will simply push any faith in our political system over the cliffWhat Lessig worried might happen if huge amounts of information were made public was that people would either intentionally or unintentionally cherry-pick information to suit their political rhetoric He used the example of people mis- or over-interpreting campaign contributions A $2700 contribution from an individual to a member of Congress is a drop in a very large bucket but rarely implies any real sense in which the politician is beholden to that person Nonetheless every election cycle sees a raft of critiques based on that relationship That was why faith in the system would be undercut he figured since public information could be cobbled together to make nearly any political pointLessig was writing only within the context of information produced by and about the government but its easy to see how the same concern ripples outward into the vast ocean of information that now exists online Its easy too to guess what prompts our revisiting Lessigs essay The release by BuzzFeed of a document full of unverified sensational allegations against president-elect Donald TrumpFor weeks (or perhaps months) news outlets have been working to report on the claims made in the file (apparently compiled by a former intelligence officer) and to determine what the ramifications have been within the American intelligence community BuzzFeed arguing that Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the president-elect dropped the file without context or clarification about what might or could be true (At least one of the more explosive allegations about a Trump lawyer meeting with Russians in Prague appears to have been )The document is full of a very particular type of information Wired  who described it as human-based intelligence that is useful in raw form but requires a lot of sifting and validation How trustworthy is the source Has the source provided good information in the past Is this someone with real information or just someone who reads the news and wants to pass along fabricated storiesIn this case a former British intelligence officer told Wired the doc gives no indication that the company has done work to rigorously separate the twoand consequently its really hard to tell whether any of the info is actually true or just a very exciting and expensively produced fan-fiction novelThere are clearly communities for whom that distinction is understood and not a reason to withhold the document from public view The president of ProPublica  its publication in part because releasing it would accelerate discovery of what in [the] dossier is true and what [is] not -- as with that Prague meeting A member of Congress  our Robert Costa that he was frustrated he only learned about the allegations after the BuzzFeed releaseBut both of those parties -- the media and elected officials -- have some desire and ability to parse whats true and untrue to apply the necessary caveats and evaluate what should and shouldnt be considered factual Looping back to Lessigs point not everyone doesThe Atlantics David Graham  that dumping the document without validation is an abdication of what BuzzFeed as a media outlet is supposed to do Members of the press are provided with any number of rumors and allegations which they are then tasked with validating or debunking its rare when a rumor is published without that process having taken place In the rush to compete in a splintered media environment that process has often been curtailed which is probably part of the reason why public confidence in the media has dipped Report one-too-many incorrect or unverifiable rumors and trust in the rest of your reporting will declineThat doesnt mean that individuals considering the details of the BuzzFeed documents are better equipped to evaluate them BuzzFeeds claim that Americans should make up their own minds about the rumors is patently ridiculous (as our ) simply because theres no realistic way for Americans to do so If CNN couldnt verify whether or not these events took place how could a random person on the street Even assuming they wanted to the most salacious story from the document is currently trending on Twitter simply because its embarrassing to Trump not because anyone has any particular reason to believe itThe broader problem for the media though is that many Americans feel as though they  evaluate information as ably as those whove spent decades immersed in the fieldYouve probably heard of the Dunning-Kruger effect Its the idea that you must have a certain amount of knowledge of a subject in order to know how little you know about it In other words the more incompetent you are at something the less likely you are to be aware of that incompetence Weve seen a rash of amateur investigations of late often motivated by political reasoning that have had unwelcome results with Pizzagate at the top of the listPizzagate -- the nonsensical idea that Hillary Clinton staffers were involved in a pedophilia ring operating in or near a DC pizza joint -- rose to national attention when a man entered the restaurant with a rifle to free children that the internet had convinced him were being enslaved there They werent and his investigation of the rumors demonstrated that to be the case The intel on this wasnt 100 percent the man later told a reporter which is actually totally wrong The intel  100 percent it just made clear that the thing he believed and hoped to be true -- that the conspiracy existed and that he could help curtail it -- wasnt accurate His self-investigation of the rumors gave him unwarranted confidence in his ability to evaluate the information presented though that information was the worst sort of cherry-picking bizarre assumptions made on emails weird assertions about iconography at restaurants and so on So much information was available about the pizza place and the Clintons that amateur sleuths could draw a line from there to child slavery if they wanted toThink of the shed in A Beautiful Mind where Russell Crowes John Nash picks out individual letters from news articles and connects them with thread in elaborate patterns Now imagine if he could post his results on the internet and build off of the threaded walls of thousands of other peopleWriting about that Pizzagate self-investigation Jonathan Mahler of the New York Times that the distribution of information that defines the internet and allows it to get around roadblocks works for good and bad[S]omewhere along the way the democratization of the flow of information became the democratization of the flow of disinformation The distinction between fact and fiction was erased creating a sprawling universe of competing claims The internet cant route around censorship when the people who use it remain in their own closed information loops which is nothing more than self-imposed censorshipThats what happened here The media has long served as an imperfect gateway blocking bad information but thanks to the splintered media environment and social media those walls have washed away The press was working to suss out what was and wasnt worth reporting from that dossier of claims but the internet routed around that holdup in the form of BuzzFeed There are some benefits to that That doesnt mean it was good to doAt some point we need to figure out how to solve this problem how to better teach people to fairly evaluate information thats presented to them and to set aside as necessary their partisan inclination to believe the worst about their opponents Were still new at this everyone can access everything and draw their own conclusions thing clearly and for all of his frustrations today it has largely served to Trumps benefit

Putin it is disadvantageous to be seen that way now16 Lets loop back to Trumps tweet about how he has ZERO investments in Russia He  with for the record17 There are  records that could prove his point as Chris Cillizza  on Tuesday his tax records18 Trump has continually refused to release his tax records saying that its because some of them are being audited A former IRS commissioner we spoke with  that this 1) wasnt prohibitive and that Trump could release the returns that are under audit if he wanted to and 2) he could easily release the older ones that  under audit (Trump says he wont)19 Trump has used the lure of someday releasing his tax records as a way of deferring other questions In May he  ABCs George Stephanopoulos that he would reveal how much he paid in taxes only when he released his returns20 When Mitt Romney was under pressure to release his taxes in 2012 well note Trump  about how he wouldnt hesitate to turn his own over I actually think that its a great thing when you can show that youve been successful and that youve made a lot of money that youve employed a lot of people he said I actually think that its a positive21 On CBS on Wednesday Manafort seemed to largely  on the records ever being released Mr Trump has said that his taxes are under audit and he will not be releasing them Manafort said22 The burden of proof is on those like Will who claim that Trump may have financial links to interests in Russia a burden that would be very hard to meet without the release of Trumps tax records or other documents detailing the income that Trump has reported23 From a political standpoint that works to Trumps disadvantage allowing his opponents to raise questions about something that can only be answered concretely by releasing documents hed like to keep private24 But Trump is pretty familiar with that political tacticAn extremely credible source has called my office and told me that s birth certificate is a fraud Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump)White House press secretary Sean Spicer made a point Monday to suggest that atop adviser to Donald Trumps presidential campaign wasnt really a top adviser at all Paul Manafort who was the campaign chairman for months was reduced to having But Manafort is hardly the only player the Trump team has downgraded retroactively  and often in the face of strong evidence to the contrary This is part of a pattern and it stretches back to the campaignIn the same briefing Monday Spicer seemed to dismiss longtime informal Trump adviser Roger Stone and former foreign policy adviserCarter Page as hangers-on Some of those names the greatest amount of interaction that theyve had is have cease-and-desist letters sent to them Spicer said Former national security adviser Michael T Flynn meanwhile was only a volunteer of the campaign Spicer saidThe common link between all four men of course is that they are now liabilities  under scrutiny for their interactions related to an investigation of Russian meddling in the campaign But Spicers efforts to suggest that their roles didnt amount to much truly strain credulityThe Trump campaign did part ways with Stone in August 2015 and the two certainly have had an odd relationship But that relationship  and Stone is widely still considered a Trump associate He  on Monday that he still advises Trump in factI prefer to communicate with the president through short pithy memos as I have for 39 years he saidStone is now  about his contacts with the hacker Guccifer 20 who has claimed responsibility for the hack at the Democratic National CommitteePage was  in March 2016 and as recently as August was described by Trump spokesman Hope Hicks as an informal adviser But after it was reported that his contacts with Russia were being investigated Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller insisted that Page and Kellyanne Conway said he was  Spicer said in January that Page was an individual who the president-elect does not know and was put on notice months ago by the campaign Trump said in February that Page In an interview with CNNs Anderson Cooper earlier this month Page declined to detail his work with the campaign but did confirm that he wrote policy papers for it And his experience on the campaign does span several months according to the Trump teams own words  suggesting another liberal usage of a short period of timeFlynns role has been even clearer than Stones and Pages Although it could be claimed that they werent a major influence on the campaign even as its clear they  involved  Flynn was there in public with Trump at campaign rallies and was a top surrogate And then he later becameTrumps national security adviser albeit briefly So calling him a volunteer for the campaign  undersells thingsBut hes not even the only member of his family whose role has been strangely played down when he became a liability His son Michael Flynn Jr became persona non grata after spreading the dubious conspiracy theory known as Pizzagate about Hillary Clinton At the time Vice President-elect Mike Pence said the younger Flynn has no involvement in the transition Miller would later clarify that Flynn Jr  The younger Michael Flynn was helping his father with some administration and scheduling duties early in the transition process and he is no longer involved with transition effortsA similar thing happened with former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski After his run-in with a reporter and some missteps during the primaries aides assured reporters in April that he was basically reduced to the role ofYet the next month he was reportedly tasked with  By June he was firedSo if you take at face value Spicers comments about Manaforts very limited role and the campaigns comments back then about Lewandowskis diminished role essentially nobody was running the campaign between April and June (In fact its widely believed that Manafort was the de facto campaign manager during that time)And judging by how things are going right nowthe number of people who were truly involved in getting Trump elected may continue to trend toward zeroIn the June 1969 issue of Civil War History  Volume 5 Number 2 pages 116-132  a renowned Southern historian attacked the legacy of Confederate Gen Robert E LeeNo single war figure stands in greater need of reevaluation than Lee wrote Thomas L Connelly the late University of South Carolina professor One ponders whether the South may not have fared better had it possessed no Robert E LeeConnellys  was among the first academic musket shotsfiredon Lees standing as an outmatched but not outwitted military genius presiding over a Lost Cause  a reputation celebrated in fawning biographies and monuments like the ones removed earlier this year in New Orleans Baltimore and other cities across the country Even the d the capital of the Confederacy is mulling what to do about its huge statue of Lee and other Confederate heroes on its iconic Monument Avenue  But no where has the fight over Lees image been more contentious than Charlottesville where an August Unite the Right rally by white supremacists neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members ended in  The city is trying to remove its Robert E Lee statueOn Monday nightWhite House Chief of Staff John F Kelly waded into the debate over Lees legacy by calling him an honorable man and telling Fox News host Laura Ingraham that the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War  Kelly argued that Lee and other historical figures should not be judged by modern standardsI think we make a mistake though and as a society and certainly as as individuals when we take what is today accepted as right and wrong and go back 100 200 300 years or more and say what those you know what Christopher Columbus did was wrong he said You know 500 years later its inconceivable to me that you would take what we think now and apply it back thenBut history is not set in bronze It evolves And though Lee remains an important powerful symbol in the South his reputation among scholars has evolved to the point that many either question or outright ridicule his stature as a battlefield savantTo Edward Bonekemper III the author of How Robert E Lee Lost the Civil War and several other books on the war Lee is not the humble proudbattlefield loser presented by documentarian Ken Burns and other popular works of history but a bumbling strategist and the central character in the most successful propaganda campaign in American historyHes talking about the Lost Cause  or as he titled a recent book The tenets of the Lost Cause are that slavery was already dying before the war that states rights were really the issue anyway that the South did the best it could against a powerful killing machine (an early version of a participation trophy) and that Lees subordinates (especially James Longstreet) bungled the war most notably the Battle of GettysburgA big part of this myth is the adulation of Robert E Lee Bonekemper said in an interview He has gotten a lot of really good pressThat began Bonekemper and other historians have written shortly after the war endedThe narratives of war are usually shaped by the winning side but after Lee surrendered the North got on with life and rebuilding the economy Meanwhile prominent Southerners set out on a spin offensive forming the Southern Historical Society which published hundreds of papers telling its side of the war and shaping its historyLee was elevated to the highest status possible  Southern SaviorThe white light that falls directly upon him one booster wrote was from the smile of an approving and sustaining God One of his former officers wrote The Divinity in [Lees] bosom shone translucent through the man and his spirit rose up to the GodlikeOne cant do much better than that bosom and allIt would take decades of academic hand-to-hand combat to unravel the mythConnellys 1969 essay which among things criticized Lees obsession with defending his home state of Virginia at all costs was met almost immediately with scorn In the next issue of Civil War History historian Albert Castel wrote that Connelly set out to do a job on Bobby LeeBut Connelly was not alone in his critique Other historians began piling onLee they wrote mishandled overall strategy of the war Outmanned Lee should have taken a more defensive posture drawing the North into difficult Southern terrain Instead he was constantly on the offensive which resulted in heavy casualties and broken spiritsAll the Confederacy needed was a stalemate which would confirm its existence as a separate country Bonekemper wrote The burden was on the North to defeat the Confederacy and compel the return of the eleven wayward states to the UnionHistorian James McPherson put it this way The South could win the war by not losing However the North could win only by winning  The noted military scholar Russell Weigley compared Lee  unfavorably  to Napoleon in his landmark 1973 book Like Napoleon himself with his passion for the strategy of annihilation and the climactic decisive battle as its expression he destroyed in the end not the enemy armies but his own Weigley wroteLees ineptitude was most damaging at GettysburgOn the third day of battle in what became known as Picketts Charge Lee ordered his troops across an open field subjecting them to heavy fire Lee did this against the advice of his subordinates The rebels suffered more than 6000 casualtiesLee apologists blamed Longstreets execution of the attack which many historians and military strategists now find laughableIn a 2006  the Center for Technology and National Security Policy  a Department of Defense research center  called Lees effort at Gettysburg a blunder that doomed the hopes of the Confederate States of AmericaThe attack was poorly planned Lee continued even as the battlefield scene suggested he shouldnt  information he either didnt seek out or ignoredRapid adaptive decision-making might have saved Lees army the briefing paper arguedThe ultimate lesson for the US military is that it is not enough to have battle-wise decision-makers they must be more battle-wise than their enemiesBonekemper has been speaking across the country  including in the South  about Lees faults and the Lost Cause myth for more than 20 yearsEarly on he faced a lot of resistance to his conclusionsNow people dont get nearly as emotional as they used to he said They are more open to hearing that there is another side to the storyMonuments fall So do their legendskidnaps hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls to be used as sex slaves Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb guns down dozens of victims at  Still other terrorists attack the  just one week after the Islamic State attacked Paris Africa has been suffering from still more terrorist shootings bombings and suicide attacks regularly  How should the United States respond to these increasing Islamist attacks in Africa The US command there has figured out a clever way to make a significant difference without overstepping its orders But as the problem of Islamist insurgencies continues the United States will have to watch out for mission creepCurrently US military policy tilts back and forth between counterinsurgency and counterterror operations (or COIN and CT in military parlance)Counterterror operations aggressively target people who are violently attacking (or planning to attack) the United States or its allies The goal Destroy our enemies or at least make it much harder for them to attack our friends The United States now has counterterrorism operations  teams of Special Forces troops and armed drones  underway in  and The other major approach is  Counterinsurgency tries to strengthen local social structures to  so that local people stop supporting armed combatants Counterinsurgency does include limited direct combat or police actions against terrorists or insurgents to protect efforts to build a functioning local community But its real goal is to build a social and stable state thats less likely to deteriorate into terrorism usually through developing representative  like constitutions and voting and local investment and building  that will improve citizens lives  However as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Middle East Policy and insurgency expert Andrew Exum  these two approaches are really a continuum rather than opposing ideas Those working to defeat non-state violent actors can shift efforts across the spectrum  building up a working government and functioning state or destroying terrorists and insurgents  to find the proper balance on the way to the goal peace and stabilityStriking that balance is particularly difficult in Africa The United States Africa Command known as AFRICOM controls all US military activity on the continent Most of the other regional combatant commands such as Pacific Command are almost purely military While it  when it was founded in 2008 AFRICOM commanders also oversee efforts for the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in addition to running its skeletal military headquarters staffAFRICOM was conceived with a commitment to being Its mission is to coordinate diplomacy development and defense policies while keeping a small presence on the continent and avoiding direct combat missions These constraints are intended to reassure  even though the United States had also remained cautious in Africa since its  in 1993  As a result defense operations have been deemphasized in favor of diplomacy and civic development The military operations pursued have been largely focused on  US allies militaries so that they could safeguard ongoing development effortsHeres the problem Since Muammar Qaddafi fell leaving Libya in violent turmoil and without a clear government violent Islamists have surged across the Sahara Desert into the weak states along the Saharas southern border a region called the Sahel Despite AFRICOMs multiyear efforts to build up partner militaries in Sahelian states such as Mali Niger Burkina Faso and Nigeria the militaries have been   in fighting off this new wave of violent extremists  And so AFRICOMs military-minded officers have started counterterror operations in West Africa The idea is that theUnited States could shift more efforts to bring down local threats like Boko Haram while continuing to help partner states like Mali and Nigeria strengthen their police and military efforts through training and armament programsBut while other combatant commands run counterterror operations by sending in  with local governments AFRICOM cannot  because it has neither the personnel nor the mandateThe solution Send in unarmed drones to help with surveillance while continuing to train and equip local allies like a and to  The unarmed drones strike the right balance By sending them AFRICOM refrains from military adventuring as per its mission while helping its partners tremendously The militaries of Cameroon Chad Mali and Niger have found it challenging just to locate the violent extremist organizations threatening them The  solve that problem enabling US allies to target their military forays effectively Not only do the surveillance drones help tremendously while staying within the mandates for a small footprint and for avoiding combat but Americans stay in control of the drones  avoiding the   (like a US-trained military officer launching a coup) that have been far too common Its a creative low-cost low-risk extension of the US militarys mission in AfricaOf course there are flaws Popular local figures have worried that even the smaller numbers of noncombatant US military personnel can  And the effort shifts resources away from AFRICOMs primary goal building a functioning civil society across the continentThe most significant danger however is that these proliferating counterterror operations are increasingly undermining AFRICOMs basic principles which guide its overall strategyBecause the United States has been reacting quickly bringing its counterterror operations where needed AFRICOMs counterterror efforts are expanding rapidly and with little outside notice or popular outcry This should be watched with extreme caution lest it become a major military commitmentBritish historians John Gallagher and Ronald Robinson assert  and that its  came from continuously reacting to local threats to its local interests and alliesSince this British experience is central to the first Scramble for Africa US mission creep may be a greater danger than anyone now recognizesImagine youre a college student Youre just minding your own business relaxing after a brutalweek of midtermswhen all of a sudden your friends startmessaging you Is this you one friend asks The message links to a viral tweetThis professor graded tests next to me the whole flight If theres a Taiwan Jones at Howard boy you failed thef out ya midterm Your name is Taiwan Jones You go to Howard CrapThis is the scenario that hundreds of thousands of people on Twitter wanted to believe was real on Thursday night as the original tweet about the grading professor  and a worried reply from one Taiwan Jones went viralBut we regret to inform you that this delightful anecdote about the power of social media is not what it seems Many key parts of the tale do not add upPlease keep reading as we slowly and meticulously destroy the joy this story may have first brought to you when you thought it was totally real Its what we doA Howard University spokeswoman confirmed to The Washington Post that the historically black college which is  did not have a student enrolled named Taiwan JonesThere are other colleges with Howard in their names so we are checking with them too Howard College a two-year school in Texas said it did not have an enrolled student named Taiwan Jones nor did Howard Community College in MarylandIts the one with nearly 150000 retweets seen aboveAfter digging around on the history of this account we can say with a great deal of certainty that until very recentlythis account tweeted underat least one completely different handle @SaucyIV_ That handle now shows up as inactive on TwitterThereare a couple of reasons we believe this is true but heres an easy way to see the link between the two handles If you look at some of the older still-live tweets from @JonesTaiwan_ they match thosewe found in a Google cache archive of @SaucyIV_s account from a few weeks agoHeres an old tweet from SaucyIV_ from a Google cache ofthe accountAnd one from @JonesTaiwan_In other words the Taiwan Jones account that went super viral was very likely changed from a previous Twitter handle to match that of the student described in themidterm tweet Its a well known relatively easy trick that shows up again and again in dubious viral Twitter moments It also works pretty well as the hundreds of thousands of retweets on the Taiwan Jones reply showWere not entirely sure but there are some clues Before SaucyIV_ became Taiwan Jones SaucyIV_ s Twitter bio indicated thatthe tweeter was an aspiring Twitch streamer or someone who wants to make a living by streaming themselves playing video games online SaucyIV_ s Twitchbio is also named SaucyIV and on that page SaucyIV is described as a 16-year-old kid named Trent who lives in CanadaWe reached out toTrent via a Twitch message and a business email found on the YouTube channel linked to the Twitch bio but did not immediately get a responseWhile were here lets addressa second Taiwan Jones account on Twitter @TaiwanJones_  to the original tweet has more than 13000 retweets Its also fake sorryIt appears to be the alternate account of another Twitter usersergi esteban troll journalist account until he changed it to try to go viral as Jones@Robinxvl also posted an image of a press request sent by BuzzFeed to the Taiwan Jones account Friday morning which he bragged about turning down because of his hate for BuzzFeed When a Washington Post journalist replied to those tweets asking if they amounted to confirmation thatthey were behind the Taiwan Jones account @Robinxvl deleted themAt this point we reached out to Roy Handy the Atlanta-based photographer who sent the original tweet in which he claimed he had observed a professor grading student midterms on a planeHandy at first declined to chat about his tweet When we said we were having trouble verifying that a Taiwan Jones existed at Howard University and that other parts of the story didnt add up Handy repliedI cannot verify what school the student attends which is why I said if in context of the tweetHecontinued I wasnt aware of how much power this relatable topic could have across the HBCU community as a whole so Id rather leave the tweet to live in speculation of what could be or could not be fact or fiction Therefore again I cannot verify any information on this for a story to be made but I hope you enjoyed itSpecial counsel Robert S Mueller III and his staff are investigating the potential role that then-candidate Donald Trumps presidential campaign had in the Russian interference in the 2016 US election The scope of Muellers probe continues to widen and it now involves potential obstruction of justice by Trump and business dealings involving Trump and his childrenTrump consistently calls allegations about Russian interference a hoax witch hunt and fake news made up by his opponents His White House continues to play down the allegations now deflecting to efforts by a Ukrainian American operativeto expose former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manaforts ties to the Russian government In response to questions about the Trump campaigns contacts with Russia the White House says the real story of coordination is between the Clinton campaign and UkraineIndeed just hoursafter this column was published the president tweeted about the issue and urged a criminal investigationUkrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign  quietly working to boost Clinton So where is the investigation AG  Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) While there are broad similarities between the two there also are key distinctions that make this a facile comparisonLets briefly refresh our memory on what we know about Russian interference in the US election (For more check out Fact Checkers  of events)In summer 2016 Democratic National Committee officials and independent security experts announced that Russian government hackers breached the DNCs computer network Hacked emails from DNC and other top Democratic operatives were released on WikiLeaks throughout the campaignLater US intelligence agencies confirmed that the Russian government directed the breach of US political organizations to help Trump win and hurt Hillary Clinton The intelligence community concluded that it was a top-down effort ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin to undermine faith in the US democratic processNow we also know that during the campaign Trumps son son-in-law and Manafort met with a Russian lawyer who hadties to the Kremlin with the expectation that the lawyer would provide incriminating information on Clinton as a part of the Russian governments efforts to help Trump and hurt Clinton (We have a  on that too)Heres what we know about the Ukraine storyIn January  that Ukrainian officials helped research connections between Manafort and Russia  particularly Manaforts role in the rise of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych A Ukrainian American Democratic operative named Alexandra Chalupa began looking into Manaforts ties to Yanukovych as a part of her volunteer work in 2014Politico reportedChalupa was hired as a consultant to the DNC during the 2016 campaign to help mobilize ethnic communities including Ukrainian Americans She left the DNC in July 2016 the DNC said She continued her research into Manafort on her own and she said she sometimes shared her findings with officials at the DNC and Clintons campaign Politico reported Former Clinton campaign officials  information from ChalupaThe exact role of embassy officials is unclear Chalupa told Politico that officials at the Ukrainian Embassy were helpful in providing guidance to her questions and that the embassy also worked with reporters researching Trump Manafort and Russia A top embassy official denied working with reporters or with Chalupa on issues related to Trump or Manafort but a former embassy officer said he was instructed to help Chalupa on her researchDNC officials denied that they coordinated with Chalupa on opposition research Chalupa was not a researcher for the DNC and the DNC did not incorporate her findings about Manafort Politico reported DNC officials told Politico that the Democratic Party had been looking into Trump and his ties to Russia long before Chalupa alerted themChalupa disputed the framing of the Politico story in  During the 2016 US election I was a part time consultant for the DNC running an ethnic engagement program Chalupa said  I was not an opposition researcher for the DNC and the DNC never asked me to go to the Ukrainian Embassy to collect informationWhat actually ended up hurting the Trump campaign was information released through an anti-corruption investigation by a Ukrainian government agency which released ledgers  $127 million in cash payments from Yanukovychs party that were earmarked for ManafortSerhiy Leshchenko a Ukrainian lawmaker and former investigative journalist publicized these ledgers and criticized Manafort Ultimately reports about these payments led to Manafort stepping down from his position as Trump campaign chairmanIn a broad sense the stories appear similar Russia wanted to help Trump and at least some Ukrainian officials were willing to assist in research that might have helped Clinton (The Ukrainian government insists it was neutral in the election)But when you dig into the details the comparison falls apart Of course one fundamental difference is that Ukraine is considered a US ally and Russia is considered an adversaryA key distinction is that in the Russia case US intelligence officials found a top-down effort initiated by Putin to illegally hack and release information in a deliberate attempt to meddle in the US election and undermine the democratic system There is no such evidence of a top-down effort in the Ukrainian case Chalupa may have worked with some embassy officials but theres no evidence that the DNC used information gathered by Chalupa or that the Ukrainians coordinated opposition research with the DNCFurther the manner in which the damaging information was obtained is different US intelligence agencies found that Putin ordered the Russian hackers who breached US political organizations In contrast Chalupa researched Manfort on her own and without the direction of the DNC The ledgers were public documents that were released as a part of an anti-corruption investigation by the Ukrainian government  not illegally obtainedSekulow says the Clinton campaign and Ukrainians shared information butthis is unsupported Clintons former campaign manager Robby Mookthat foreign agents did not reach out to the campaign about opposition research There is no evidence that the Clinton campaign had contacts with the Ukrainian government Meanwhile we have documented evidence that Trumps son son-in-law and former campaign chairman met with a Russian lawyer in an attempt to receive opposition research that they were told was from the Russian governmentThe White House has been pushing this narrative to distract from the Trump campaigns willingness to work with a hostile foreign government to interfere in our election No one is buying it said DNC spokeswoman Adrienne WatsonThe White House did notprovide an explanation of this comparison in response to our requestThe Trump camps role in the Russian interference in the US election is still under investigation We dont have all the details about Ukrainian ties to Chalupa or the DNC either What we do know so far is that there are key differences in the two situations and its clearly a facile comparison so far We will not rate this comparison for now because there are too many missing details but we will update this fact check if new information emerges()In an  Newt Gingrich urged President Trump not to fireAttorney General Jeff Sessions But having met with Trump personally the day before Gingrich provided a real window into Trumps justification for doing so Its all about the deep state and theyre paid killersGingrichs case boils down to the Justice Department being an inherently corrupt left-leaning organization that left to its own devices will unfairly try to take Trump down Sessions was the guy who could have prevented that but he recused himselfThe presidents deeply troubled and I think that hes legitimately troubled Gingrich said adding I think that hes deeply troubled by the entire way that both [former FBI director James] Comey and [special counsel Robert] Mueller have operated and the degree to which the attorney general has not exercised any authority over thatWhen the interviewer NPRs Rachel Martin noted that its not the attorney generals job to protect the president Gingrich  tellingly  quibbled with the premiseNo thats not true It is the attorney generals job to enforce the law Gingrich noted He added that there was not yet any evidence of a crime So what is Mueller investigating he said Muellers engaged in a fishing expeditionGingrich pointed repeatedly to a study showing  and reports that basically all of the donations from Muellers law firmhave gone to Democrats He mentioned  a former federal prosecutor about alleged corruption in the departmentIf you believe the Justice Department doesnt have a deep cultural bias and you believe that the average conversation at the Justice Department is not anti-Trump youre living in a fantasyland Gingrich said And thats the presidents frustrationHe added In terms of the people Muellers hiring these are paid killersIf this is truly a reflection of what Trump believes  that the special counsel investigation is inherently out to crucify himand thatits mere existence assures that outcome  then that explains why he would do just about anything to stop itThe alternate explanation of course is that Trump actually has something to hide and hell do whatever it takes to prevent Mueller from uncovering it  up to and including trying to get rid of his own attorney general as a means to also getting rid of Mueller Why be afraid of something if you didnt do anything wrong Martin asked Gingrich about thatYou look at that record you would assume automatically Muellers going to get somebody he said And theres no question in my mind Muellers bought in killers those killers are gonna go out and find somebodyWhether this is political cover for Trump or how Trump actually feels its a striking argument to make Its the very definition of a deep-state conspiracy theory in fact And its apparently at the root of whatever decision Trump will make next when it comes to SessionsLONDON  The former British intelligence officer who had a key role in drafting the  that alleged Russia holds compromising material and information on President-elect Donald Trump has gone into hiding according to British reportsChristopher Steele a former MI6 officer and the director of a private-sector security firm in London was named as the author of the 35-page packet making the explosive  and unsubstantiated  claims  According to British media reports Steele 52 fled his home in Runfold a village about 40 miles southwest of London on Wednesday morning before he was identified later in the day in a Wall Street Journal reportBefore leaving his residence Steele called his next-door neighbor Mike Hopper and asked if he could look after his three cats Steele moved in about 18 months ago with his wife and four kids his neighbor saidHe has asked me to do that sort of thing before so I didnt take it as anything different I was just about ready to go to work and he called me and asked me to come in gave me the key to the house  He said that the family would be away for a while would I mind looking after the animals Hopper said in an interview with The Washington PostSteele didnt say where he was going or when he would be back Hopper said that Steele a Cambridge University graduate was one of the more eminent Russia specialists for the Secret Intelligence Service better known as MI6 and had spent two years in Moscow in the 1990s The newspaper said he was a contemporary and friend of Alex Younger who now heads MI6 and at one point Steele was in charge of the services Russia deskDirector of National Intelligence James R Clapper said Wednesday night that US spy agencies had not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable But US officials speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters have said that Steeles source network was viewed as credibleA summary of the document was attached to a classified report on Russian interference in the presidential election that was given to President Obama and Trump FBI Director James B Comey pulled Trump aside at the briefing with intelligence chiefs in New York and told him about the attached summary according to a US official CNN first reported the exchange  The president-elect described the allegations as all fake news  phony stuff and said it was a disgrace that that information would be let outSteeles London-based firm Orbis Business

siteNeither Steele nor his fellow director Chris Burrows could be reached for commentWhile Steeles name was first published in the United States the British media  not usually known for restraint  held off for several hoursIn Britain there is a long-standing tacit agreement between the government and media whereby the media receives a notice  known officially as a Defense and Security Media Advisory Notice  and agrees not to publish certain information relating to national security The system has been in place for decades and is purely voluntaryThe British media received such a notice Wednesday night just after 630 pm local timeIn view of media stories alleging that a former SIS officer was the source of the information which allegedly compromises President-elect Donald Trump would you and your journalists please seek my advice before making public that name wrote Air Vice-Marshal Andrew Vallance secretary of the Defense and Security Media Advisory Committee the body that issued the media noticeIrrespective of whether or not the stories are true the public disclosure of that name would put the personal security of that individual directly at risk he wroteBut after Steeles name started appearing in the US media it then became increasingly difficult to hold that line Vallance said in an interviewHe said his committee sent around another notice advising the British media

to be from women a few tweeted in support of male victims of rape and sexual assault as wellnot only is victim shaming of women #notokay but treating male victims of sexual assault as if theyre weak is also repulsing one person Hundreds of others used the #NotOkay hashtag to offer general support to victims of sexual assault and urge others to change the cultureEssential reading for anyone

half since 1993 an American is sexually assaulted every two minutes according to statistics from theRape Abuse Incest National Network a nonprofit that advocates for survivors of sex crimesAbout one of every six women in the US  and about one in 33 men  has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime the group saidRecovering from sexual assault or abuse is a process and that process looks different for everyone a statement on the RAINN website reads It may take weeks months or years theres no timetable for healingIn his spinoff series Game of Drones he simply recaps the entirety of the HBO hit show The plot of a recent episode is much more straightforward The episode starts with a trip to Trader Joes Then we make two Super Bowl sandwiches[]The presidents son son-in-law and former campaign manager are expectedto testify July 26 before the Senate Judiciary Committee about foreign influence on the US election  in particular about their meeting with a Russian attorney with ties to the Kremlin who they believed would provide dirt on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaignAlthough the president now praises his son for being transparent about the meeting Donald Trump Jrs statements about the ordeal shifted as more information was reported publicly And what we know so far contradicts his earlier statements denying setting up a meeting with a Russian national for campaign purposes (Moreover the White House and Trumps team having contacts with Russian nationals)We compiled a timeline of what the public found out when about the meeting and what Trump Jr and Trump said about the developments We will update this timeline as necessaryIn an Jake Tapper asked Trump Jrabout then-Clinton campaign manager Robby Mooks suggestion that Russians had hacked the Democratic National Committee networkto help Trump and hurt Clinton Trump Jr called the claims liesNow we know that just one month before this interview Trump Jr set up a meeting with a Russian attorneywhom he believed would offer dirt on Clinton involving very high level and sensitive information but ispart of Russia and its governments support for Mr TrumpIn an interview with the New York Times Trump Jr denied that he had participated in any meetings with Russians relating to the presidential campaignThis statement turned out to be false that in June 2016 when his father was the presumptive GOP presidential nominee Trump Jr arranged a meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin Paul Manafort then the campaign chairman and the presidents son-in-law Jared Kushner also attended the Times reportedFor years Veselnitskaya worked to overturn the Magnitsky Act a 2012 US law that blocks Russians who are suspected of human rights abuses After former president Barack Obama signed the Magnitsky Act Russian President Vladimir Putin responded by blocking adoptions of Russian children by US parentsTrump Jr confirmed that the meeting took place  which contradicts his March 2017 denial to the TimesIn his statement Trump Jr said the meeting was primarily about the adoption programTrump Jr was not forthcoming about the motivations behind this meeting which we would find out the next day that Trump Jr was in fact promised damaging information about Clintonbefore arranging the meeting with Veselnitskaya It was unclear whether the attorney actually produced damaging information about Clinton at the meeting but the expectation was that she would the Times reportedTrump Jrs response then shifted acknowledging that he had met with her for campaign information but that the meeting turned out to be about adoptionsMeanwhile President Trump tweeted two days after his meeting with Putin at the G-20 summit that Putin had denied Russian meddling in the 2016 electionsI strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election He vehemently denied it Ive already given my opinion Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) On Fox News Sunday White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus called the Trump Jr meeting a big nothing burger that was about adoptions the existence of an email exchange with Trump Jr and Rob Goldstone the intermediary who helped broker the meeting with Veselnitskaya Goldstone is a music publicist who represented Emin Agalarov whose father is a major real estate developer close to Putin and who worked with Trump in 2013 to bring the Miss Universe pageant to MoscowSources who described the emails said Trump Jr was promised potentially damaging information on Clinton via the Russian governmentTrump Jrs lawyer said in a statement that this is much ado about nothing The attorney Alan Futerfas acknowledged this meeting was set up with the expectation that Trump Jr would receive information on ClintonTrump Jr tweeted sarcastically about opposition research Again this contradicts his March 2017 claim to the Times that he had not set up any meetings with Russians about campaign-related issuesObviously Im the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent went nowhere but had to listen  Donald Trump Jr (@DonaldJTrumpJr) No inconsistency in statements meeting ended up being primarily about adoptions In response to further Qs I simply provided more details  Donald Trump Jr (@DonaldJTrumpJr) The Times obtained the email exchange Moments before the Times story posted Trump Jr released the emails on Twitter claiming he did so to be totally transparentRemember why  published the emails Because the  did not stop working to inform the public Adam Goldman (@adamgoldmanNYT)  confirmed the Timess reporting From the outset Trump Jr set up the meeting to receive confidential and potentially damaging information on Clinton provided through the Russian governmentIf its what you say I love it especially later in the summer Trump Jr wrote to Goldstone referring to when his father officially would be the GOP candidateLater that day Trump Jr told Fox Newss Sean Hannity that he left the meeting feeling annoyed because the attorney wanted to talk about adoptions rather than giving incriminating information on ClintonThe email chain contradicted several previous Trump Jr statementsOver the next several days it was revealed that there were attending the meeting including a Russian-American lobbyist and a man who  into foreign money-laundering operations using US banksTrumps lawyerrepeatedly saidthat Trump was not involved in draftingand did not sign off on his sons original statement on July 8 in response to the Times reporting This would On July 12 Trump commented publicly for the first time about his sons meetingTrump and his son continue to characterize this as an ordinary move by campaigns conducting opposition researchMy son Donald did a good job last night He was open transparent and innocent This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history Sad Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don jr attended in order to get info on an opponent Thats politics Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) But this is misleading and yet another attempt to spin the truthVeterans of previous presidential campaigns from both parties said it would be very odd and highly unusual to accept opposition research from foreign officials For example ahead of a presidential debate during the 2000 campaign then-Vice President Al Gores adviser Tom Downey  with information that was stolen from the George W Bush campaign Downey who was helping Gore with debate preparation at the time turned the material over to the FBI Heto avoid the perception of improper advantage and the campaign  about what happened along with a detailed timelineFrom the chief strategist of Mitt Romneys 2012 presidential campaignIf you can find someone in other presidential campaigns who has received oppo from foreign interests please share  stuart stevens (@stuartpstevens) Gary Maloney a longtime GOP opposition researcher  I do not fault Donald Jr for wanting to win He seeks more data more leads  nothing wrong there But where was the campaign team The managers job is to protect the candidate and family from blowback I worked in Bush 88  would [campaign manager] Lee Atwater have allowed George W at such a sitdown Inconceivable Would John Podesta

is elected presidentFor years Ed Gillespie has pushed for the Republican Party to expand its appeal to voters of color to survive in a changing countryAs head of the Republican National Committee in 2004 he oversaw a $10million initiative to reach out to Hispanics while also trying to make inroads with black and Asian voters He has championed a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants And he said the GOPs Virginia gubernatorial nominee in 2005 Jerry W Kilgore lost the election because he alienated Latino voters with an  Now Gillespie is running for governor and his commitment to a big-tent party is being tested in President Trumps AmericaIn the campaigns final stretch Gillespies paid advertising has focused heavily on the  an issue he has tried to tie to his Democratic opponent Lt Gov Ralph Northam He also has vowed to preserve the states Confederate monuments and he attacked Democrats for  and who are disproportionately blackThe victory of Trump  who campaigned on a hard-line immigration platform and repeatedly disparaged minorities  upended conventional GOP thinking about the value of a big-tent approach  A Gillespie victory in a diversifying Virginia  where a Republican hasnt won statewide since 2009  would cement the value of running hard to the right on cultural issues political observers and strategists sayI think [Gillespie has] realized that the big tent is slowly becoming a yurt said Jennifer Duffy who tracks gubernatorial races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report We are going to see a lot more of this in 2018 especially in primariesGillespie resists suggestions that his tone on issues affecting minority voters has changed He says he lives up to his for ALL Virginians campaign slogan mingling with voters at mosques ethnic food festivals and black-owned barber shops He has also tapped high-profile Latino surrogates to campaign with him SenMarco Rubio (R-Fla) and New Mexico Gov Susana Martinez (R)I take my campaign to every corner of the commonwealth he said in a recent interviewOn the trail Gillespie is more comfortable talking about tax cuts and jump-starting the economy than race And when he does approach the explosive issue he strikes a measured toneVictims of MS-13 gang violence he notes are often immigrants He says Confederate monuments should have historical context to ensure they dont And he acknowledges racial disparities in the criminal justice systemBut his campaign commercials and mailers on the same issues which experts say reach a larger audience strike a  harsher tone  His personal style is the big-tent Republican in him said Bob Holsworth a veteran observer of Virginia politics But the campaign has a strong dose of TrumpismRace took center stage in Virginias elections after white nationalists descended into Charlottesville to support a Confederate monument sparking violence that left many injured and one woman dead Gillespie repeatedly denounced the group but recent Democratic  links Gillespie to the white supremacists because he never explicitly condemned Trump for saying there were very fine people on both sides While Gillespie says his MS-13 ads are about public safety Democrats and immigration advocates blast the commercials  which include images of tattooed Latino men and the gang slogan Kill Rape Control  as stoking fears of minority criminals and  They may even have gotten Trumps attention He  that echoed the false claims in the MS-13 ads against Northam Earlier this week Trump followed up with a set of tweets that said Gillespie would protect  And they were certainly noticed by former president Barack Obama who delivered a scathing attack on the ads during a rally last week for Northam in Richmond  Virginia Del Jason S Miyares (R-Virginia Beach) dismissed fellow Latinos who are critical of the ads I dont think they give enough credit to voters of Virginia that this is about criminal gangs this isnt about Latinos he saidGillespie recently brushed off criticism when callers to a radio show challenged the ads Its others conflating MS-13 and the immigrant community not me he said Im making a very clear distinctionMike Madrid a GOP strategist says such ads are effective with some voters but also alienate Latinos the fastest-growing segment of the US electorate Most polls have shown Gillespie either tied with or narrowly trailing Northam  When you are behind you have to shoot every arrow in your quiver said Madrid an expert on the behavior of Latino voters But you are creating generational problems to win short-term election cycles and thats the California storyIn California Gov Pete Wilson a moderate Republican who once backed immigration reform campaigned for reelection in 1994 on a platform of denying state benefits to immigrants living in the state illegallyWilson handily won But it was seen as a Pyrrhic victory that electrified Latino voters and permanently tarnished the GOP brand in a state that is now solidly blueGillespie invoked Wilson in a 2006 warning to Republicans against  messaging that can be perceived as anti-LatinoAnti-immigration rhetoric is a political siren song and Republicans must resist its lure by lashing ourselves to our partys twin masts of freedom and growth  or our majority will crash on the shoals Gillespie wrote in an opinion piece for the Wall Street JournalHe credited Republican Robert F McDonnells victory in Virginias 2009 gubernatorial election to engaging Hispanic voters who make up about  of the electorate instead of indulging in the anti-immigration rhetoric of past Republican campaignsFrank Sharry executive director of the pro-immigration group Americas Voice said he was shocked to see Gillespies evolutionMr Gillespie is putting his relatively good reputation on the line in a way that will tarnish him forever Sharry said  In recent years the Republican Party has gone through a tumultuous journey on immigration issues  creating a tightrope for candidates President George W Bushs attempt at comprehensive immigration reform including a path to legal status failed in 2007  the same week Gillespie became a White House counselor Gillespie also advised 2012 presidential contender Mitt Romney whose loss resulted in an autopsy that urged the party to embrace comprehensive immigration reformBut calls for more moderate positions receded as primary voters and activists demanded a tougher stance on immigration They flexed their muscles in Virginia in 2014 when voters in the Richmond suburbs  then the House majority leader In the 2016 GOP presidential primaries past support for an overhaul became liabilities for former Florida governor Jeb Bush and RubioGillespie almost became a victim himself when he the Republican primary in June to Corey A Stewart  a Trump acolyte who made defending Virginias Confederate statues his signature cause and promised to crack down on illegal immigrantsBy September Gillespie was adopting some of the same tactics for the general electionIf Gillespie wins Republicans competing in the 2018 midterms will embrace his approach to racial issues said Tom Steyer a Democratic megadonor who has spent at least $3 million to elect Democrats in Virginia this yearMr Gillespie has descended to a very low level of division and racialization and if it works I think Republicans across the country are going to draw the conclusion that thats where they have to go Steyer saidIn New Jersey which is holding the nations only other gubernatorial contest this year the Republican candidate is airing a who allegedly raped a child and shot four young people and accuses the Democratic candidate of wanting to make the state a sanctuary for illegal immigrantsRepublicans this year have homed in on criticism of sanctuary cities  a loosely defined term that generally refers to jurisdictions that see immigration enforcement as a strictly federal responsibility and do not alert federal officials about someone who might be in the country illegally They also will not hold suspected undocumented immigrants after they have completed a jail sentence for them to be picked up by federal authorities  Gillespies ads accuse Northam of casting a deciding vote against a ban on sanctuary cities But Virginia does not have sanctuary cities and Northam did not cast a deciding vote because the bill eventually passed the legislature and was vetoed by Gov Terry McAuliffe (D)Gillespies sanctuary cities ads are not only targeted at ruby-red rural districts where he needs to turn out his base but also geared toward moderate voters in purple Washington exurbs that are crucial for statewide victoryKilgore currently finance chair of the state GOP says the immigration ads he aired in 2005 are not comparable to Gillespies advertising blitzEd has actually found a public safety issue that resonates not just with the immigrant community but with soccer moms and others in Northern Virginia Kilgore saidGillespie and his surrogates frequently highlight eight recent killings in Northern Virginia that authorities believe are related to MS-13 And the candidate often mentions that he hears concerns about the gang from voters in Northern Virginia including from an unidentified Hispanic faith leader  At a recent town hall in Leesburg  in the swing Washington exurb of Loudoun County  Gillespie ended his speech by talking about the threat of MS-13 gang violence stressing that he joined local law enforcement for a ride-along and that he would work with Rep Barbara Comstock a Republican who represents the area in Congress to increase funding for a regional gang task forceAmong the attendees was Celia Meyer a 27-year-old new mother who lives in nearby Ashburn She prefers not to discuss Trump and says Gillespies call to reduce taxes is enough to win her vote But she also said his criticism of sanctuary cities hits upon valid concernsTheres nothing wrong with trying to make our country safer especially when people arent supposed to be here in the first place Meyer saidOthers resent the idea that Gillespies criticism of sanctuary cities amounts to a hard-right immigration stanceCalling him racist at every turn is stupid and saying You dont want violent gangs means You hate immigrants is stupid said Theseus Schulze a 23-year-old law student who voted for Libertarian Gary Johnson in November Him saying no sanctuary cities is a totally moderate position that most people support but Democrats go crazy and call him racistA top executive from Donald Trumps real estate company emailed Russian President Vladimir Putins personal spokesman during the US presidential campaign last year to ask for help advancing  according to documents submitted to Congress on MondayThe request came in a mid-January 2016 email from Michael Cohen one of Trumps closest business advisers who asked longtime Putin lieutenant Dmitry Peskov for assistance in reviving a deal that Cohen suggested was languishingOver the past few months I have been working with a company based in Russia regarding the development of a Trump Tower-Moscow project in Moscow City Cohen wrote to Peskov according to a person familiar with the email Without getting into lengthy specifics the communication between our two sides has stalledAs this project is too important I am hereby requesting your assistance I respectfully request someone preferably you contact me so that I might discuss the specifics as well as arranging meetings with the appropriate individuals I thank you in advance for your assistance and look forward to hearing from you soon Cohen wroteCohens email marks the most direct outreach documented by a top Trump aide to a similarly senior member of Putins governmentCohen told congressional investigators in a statement Monday that he did not recall receiving a response from Peskov or having further contact with Russian government officials about the project The email addressed to Peskov appeared to have been sent to a general Kremlin press accountThe note adds to the list of contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials that have been a focus of multiple congressional inquiries as well as an investigation led by special counsel Robert S Mueller III exploring Russian interference in the 2016 election US intelligence agencies have concluded that the Kremlin intervened to help elect TrumpCohens email to Peskov provides an example of a Trump business official directly seeking Kremlin assistance in advancing Trumps business interestsCohen told congressional investigators that the deal was envisioned as a licensing project in which Trump would have been paid for the use of his name by a Moscow-based developer called IC Expert Investment Co Cohen said that he discussed the deal three times with Trump and that Trump signed a letter of intent with the company on Oct 28 2015 He said the Trump company began to solicit designs from architects and discuss financingHowever he said that the project was abandoned for business reasons when government permission was not secured and that the matter was not related in any way to Mr Trumps presidential campaignCohens request to Peskov came as Trump was distinguishing himself on the campaign trail with his warm rhetoric about PutinCohen said in his statement to Congress that he wrote the email at the recommendation of  who was serving as a broker on the dealIn the statement obtained by The Washington Post Cohen said Sater suggested the outreach because a massive Trump development in Moscow would require Russian government approval White House special counsel Ty Cobb said Trump knew nothing about Cohens effort to enlist Peskovs helpThe mere fact that there was no apparent response suggests this is a non-collusion story he said Cohen has been one of Trumps closest aides since 2007 serving as a business emissary lawyer and sometimes spokesman for Trump Friends said Trump has treated Cohen like a member of his family Cohen who was executive vice president of the Trump Organization did not have a formal role in Trumps campaign But he spoke with reporters as a defender of Trump and appeared on television as a surrogate for the candidate He left the company shortly before Trump was inaugurated as president and since January has served as one of Trumps personal lawyersIn a statement to The Post Cohen described the potential Moscow project as simply one of many development opportunities that the Trump Organization considered and ultimately rejectedIt should come as no surprise that over four decades the Trump Organization has received and reviewed countless real estate development opportunities both domestic and international he added Cohen said he abandoned the project because he lost confidence that the Moscow developer would be able to obtain land financing and government approvals It was a building proposal that did not succeed and nothing more he saidThe Post reported Sunday that Cohen had been in negotiations with Sater and foreign investors to build a Trump Tower in the Russian capital from September 2015 through the end of January 2016 at the same time Trump was campaigning for president Trump entered the race in June 2015 and by January 2016 he was leading in the polls for the Republican nominationCohen told congressional investigators that Sater constantly pushed him to travel to Moscow as part of the negotiations but that he declined to do soHe said that Sater who has attempted to broker Trump deals for more than a decade was prone to salesmanship and that as a result he did not routinely apprise others in the company about their interactions and never considered asking Trump to go to Moscow as Sater had requestedSater said in a statement Monday that he brought the idea of the largest tower in Russia to Cohen his longtime friend Despite Saters enthusiasm for the plan he said the Trump Organization abandoned it Michael Cohen was the only member of the Trump Organization who I communicated with on this project Sater saidOver email Sater bragged to Cohen that he could get Putin to assist with the project and that it would help Trumps presidential campaign according to correspondence submitted to congressional investigatorsOur boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it Sater wrote in a November 2015 email I will get all of Putins team to buy in on this I will manage this processThe Post on Sunday first reported on the existence of the emails copies of which were published Monday by the New York TimesIn another email published by the Times and confirmed by The Post Sater described accompanying Trumps daughter Ivanka Trump on a 2006 trip to Moscow I arranged for Ivanka to sit in Putins private chair at his desk and office in the Kremlin Sater wroteIvanka Trump said she had taken a brief tour of the Kremlin but did not recall sitting in Putins chairShe added I was not part of Michael Cohens discussions surrounding a potential Trump project that he was evaluating in 2015 in Russia with the exception of recommending architects to consider as part of the routine design process for any potential dealDonald Trump has tried to distance himself from Sater a New York developer whose office was located in Trump Tower and who helped broker licensed Trump deals Sater had served time in jail in the 1990s after a bar fight and pleaded guilty in 1998 to his role in Mafia-linked stock fraud Federal officials have said he then cooperated on various national security and criminal investigations In writing to Peskov Cohen was reaching out to a Kremlin official considered one of the main gatekeepers to PutinPeskov was appointed the head of the presidential press service in 2000 during Putins first term and has served as a spokesman for Putin in various roles since staying with Putin during his four years as prime minister Because he regularly travels with and speaks to Putin he is a target for lobbyists and petitioners trying to attract the Russian presidents attention Aside from being the Kremlins mouthpiece hes definitely someone who is viewed as a senior lieutenant an important oligarch in Putins power system said Steven L Hall who retired from the CIA in 2015 after 30 years of managing the agencys Russia operations If youre looking for someone who is close to Putin Dmitry Peskov is as good as any of them Asked for comment about the Trump Tower negotiations Amanda Miller a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization emphasized Monday that Cohen did not pursue the deal beyond its initial stages After the signing of a non-binding letter of intent  it was not significantly advanced (ie there was no site no financing and no development) she wrote in an email to The Post To be clear the Trump Organization has never had any real estate holdings or interests in RussiaStill Trump repeatedly tried for three decades to build in Russia In 2013 he signed a preliminary agreement to build a tower in partnership with Aras Agalarov a billionaire who had financed the Trump-owned Miss Universe pageant when it was held in Moscow in 2013 Agalarov told The Post last year that his companys deal with Trump was on hold because of the presidential campaignA representative of Agalarovs company attended a June 2016 meeting with top Trump aides and a Russian lawyer organized by Donald Trump Jr after he was told that the lawyer would provide damaging information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton provided by the Russian government Scott Balber an attorney for Agalarov said Agalarov and his company played no role in the 2015-16 Trump Tower proposal Andrew Roth in Moscow contributed to this reportWhen a White House is confronted with a negative news story officials face a difficult challenge if the story is largely correct A common PR technique is to deny things that are not in the story or to make sweeping declarations while ignoring the specificsThe Trump White House is playing this game in its response to several key points fromAs a guide to readers The Fact Checker will translate the comments made by national security adviser HR McMaster both on Monday evening and Tuesday morning in response to the Post reportThe key phrase is as reported With this language McMaster in theory could dispute anyelement no matter how small as false He notably did not say the story was falseThis is confirmation that the laptop discussion took placeThe Post story did not say intelligence sources or methods were discussed or that Trump discussed undisclosed military operations So this is classic deflection from the key findings of the report the PR version of three-card monteNow McMastersays the premise of the article is false In other words it made the president look bad not that it was wrongMcMaster ducks a question about whether Trump disclosed highly classified information to the Russians Thats confirmation that this detailin the article is correctA reporter asked whether Trump shared sensitive information received from a partner Again McMaster does not deny that aspect of the article So thats further confirmation that a key detail of the story is correctThis is a judgment call but what White House is going to say the president did something inappropriate The Post article merely noted some of the possible consequences from Trump sharing the information but made no judgment on whether Trump had the authority totake the action he tookMcMaster confirms another key detail in the article  that Thomas P Bossert assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism placed calls to the directors of the CIA and the NSA to inform them that the president shared the information toRussia (The Post also reported that one of Bosserts subordinates also called for the problematic portion of Trumps discussion to be stricken from internal memos) Its a bit strange that McMaster would not have discussed this with one of his key subordinates so were dubiousabout the credibility of that commentAgain this gets back to the White House trying to push back against the idea that Trump did something wrong Which White House aide is going to publicly admit that a presidents decision was inappropriate By naming three officials McMaster is trying to elevate this point but again its a judgment call that does not call into the question the keyfacts contained in the articleMcMaster confirms another detail in the article  that this was a spur of the moment decision by the president not part of the meetingplanMcMaster asked if Trump revealed the city where the intelligence was gathered again does not deny this specific element of the article Instead he says the name would be familiar to anyone reading about the Islamic State This is an interesting bit of spin because the article says White House officials had specifically asked The Washington Post not to reveal the name of the cityMcMaster actually has no way of knowing the possible consequences of Trump sharing the information The Post article noted the concerns of several US officials familiar with the intelligence and how it was gathered including that Russia could use it to help identify the US ally or intelligence capability involved especially if it involved intelligence on Russias activities in SyriaThis is deflection The president would not necessarily know sources of intelligence unless he specifically asked But intelligence is  So presumably Trump knew that before he shared it with RussiaIn the course of two media appearances McMaster essentially confirmed thatThese are the key factual elementsof the Post article The only real issue in dispute is whether Trumps actions hurt the intelligence-gathering methods of the United States and intelligence cooperation with friendly countries That will be up to the judgment of history()The Environmental Protection Agency has given notice to dozens ofscientists that they will not

second term is if your expertise was no longer needed Swackhamer saidThe EPAs Board of Scientific Counselors advises the agencys Office of Research and Development which is being targeted for extremely deep budget cuts on whether the research it does has sufficient rigor and integrity and addresses important scientific questionsPeter Meyer an economist with the EP Systems Group who had already  from theboards subcommitteeto protest the ongoingshake-up said that he and his colleagues had thought they would be staying onWe were told quite explicitly by the leadership of the sustainable and healthy communities group  that our assignment was a four-to-five-year assignment Meyer said That was what we were told at our first meeting That produces an assumption that youre going to get reappointed so that you can complete the job  Scott Openshaw a spokesman for the American Chemistry Council which represents the chemical industry said in an email that the turnover would address his groups and others concerns in the past that EPA advisory boards did not include a diversity of views and therefore frequently presented a biased perspective on issues before themAll stakeholders industry and consumers benefit by ensuring regulations are based on the best science available he added We are hopeful Administrator Pruitts actions will help to ensure regulatory decisions are based on the highest quality science enhance accountability create greater balance more transparency and fewer conflicts of interest on EPA advisory boardsMeyer however said that he fears the goal is to clear out the membership of these boards so that new members can be appointed perhaps those who are more favorable to the communities actually being regulated by the EPAElena Craft a researcher based at the advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund who serves on a subcommittee of the board focused on also said she received the notice MondayIts just yet another example of the administrations disregard for independent scientific counsel on issues that are critically important to the nation Craft said She added that her subcommittee was scheduled to meet in September but thats now offThis gives me a great deal of concern about the erosion of science in this administration said Robert Richardson an ecological economist and associate professor in Michigan State UniversitysDepartment of Community Sustainability who co-chaired one of the BOSC subcommittees and was let go earlier this spring Its hard to understand the rationale behind a decision like this I understand they might simply want to repopulate [the board] with people of their own choosing However this could also be a way of just weakening advisory boards of diminishing their role by not replacing membersRichardson said other colleagues had contacted him this week about the news that the EPA would not renew the terms of dozens of additional scientific advisers to the agencyI dont think anybody is terribly surprised he said [Trump officials] have been clear that they intend to wipe all these slates clean They want no continuity from any decisions that were made by the previous administration even nonpolitical decisionsRichardson said serving as an effective outsider adviser to the EPA comes with a steep learning curve and that over the years he and his colleagues had worked hard during their years on the board to build a rapport with EPAs Office of Research and Development and to serve the agency effectivelyAll that knowledge will be lost he saidPruitt has taken a deep interest in what scientific questions the EPA should be exploring in the coming years according to his aides and a transformation of the board could make a shift in focus easier to carry out Many Republicans have criticized the agency for devoting too much of its resources toward climate change in recent years as opposed to more traditional environmental threatsThis appears tobe just the start of advisory committee changes at the EPA The agencys Science Advisory Board (SAB) and Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) also likely will be changed in the futureOne senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing conversations said that a segment of the Scientific Advisory Board rotates off each year and the agency will issue a Federal Register notice in the next couple of weeks that will invite applicants to replace those members whose terms are expiringEPA is currently deliberating next steps for the SAB and CASAC said one senior agency official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because no final decision has been madePresident Trump declared Tuesday that counterprotesters at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville acted violently and should share the blame for the  that left a woman dead and many injuredSpeaking at Trump Tower in Manhattan the president called the events of Saturday at the Unite the Right rally a horrible thing to watch but he emphasized that both sides acted irresponsiblyI think theres blame on both sides And I have no doubt about it Trump saidYou had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent he added No one wants to say that but Ill say it right now You had a group on the other side that came charging in without a permit and they were very very violentTrumps remarks came a day after he belatedly condemned the Ku Klux Klan neo-Nazis and other hate groups that organized and participated in the rally He had faced mounting pressure from lawmakers and civil rights groups over his failure to do so during his initial reaction to the violence when he denounced violence on many sides  But Tuesday Trump defended his handling of the Charlottesville situation stating he did not want to jump to conclusions in his initial remarks There was no way of making a correct statement that early he said in an impromptu news conference in the lobby of Trump Tower after an announcement about infrastructure I had to see the facts unlike a lot of reportersTrump called the driver of the car that killed counterprotester Heather Heyer 32 and injured 19 a disgrace to himself his family and the country but he stopped short of declaring the action a case of domestic terrorism calling that an exercise in semantics Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said that the act fits that definition and the Justice Department has launched a federal civil rights probe into Heyers death Prosecutors have charged James Alex Fields Jr of Ohio who has reportedly espoused Nazi propaganda and participated in the rally with the crimeYou can call it terrorism You can call it murder You can call it whatever you want Trump said I call it the fastest outcome to a good verdict  You get into legal semantics The driver of the car was a murderer What he did was a horrible horrible inexcusable thing  Trump emphasized repeatedly that he believed many of the Unite the Right rally participants were not members of hate groups and were there to protest the pending removal by the city of a statue of the Confederate Gen Robert E LeeYou had people in that group who were protesting the taking down of what to them is a very very important statue Trump said before suggesting that Lee and other Confederate-era generals including Stonewall Jackson are the victims of historical revisionism attempting to delegitimize their rolesSpeaking rhetorically Trump asked reporters whether George Washington and Thomas Jefferson both slave owners should suffer the same fate and have their statues removed Youre changing history youre changing culture he saidTrump reiterated his condemnation of neo-Nazis and other white supremacists But he also made clear that he believed that some of the counterprotesters were armed and took aggressive actions that helped spark the violenceWhat about the alt-left that came charging at the alt-right  do they have any semblance of guilt Trump said They came charging clubs in hand swinging clubsLawmakers on both sides of the aisle including Sens Marco Rubio (R-Fla) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) quickly denounced Trumps remarksMr Presidentyou cant allow  to share only part of blameThey support idea which cost nation & world so much pain 5/6 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) As a Jew as an American as a human words cannot express my disgust and disappointment This is not my President Brian Schatz (@brianschatz) But in a sign of how Trumps stance would be embraced by white nationalist groups David Duke a former KKK leader thanked Trump for his honesty & courageThank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about  & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa  David Duke (@DrDavidDuke)President Trump on Friday directed the Pentagon to ban the recruitment of openly transgender people but is leaving it to military leaders to determine whether individuals already in the armed forces should be allowed to continue to serveThe presidential memorandum signed by Trump will also prevent the military from providing medical treatment for sex- reassignment surgeriesTrump is reversing an Obama administration policy that was the latest step in the advancement of rights for lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people in the US military in recent years But the White House said Trump thinks his predecessor failed to provide sufficient basis to determine whether terminating the Defense Departments long-standing policy on transgender individuals would hinder military effectiveness and lethality disrupt unit cohesion or tax military resourcesThe memorandum states thatfurther study is necessary to ensure that the policy change will not have negative effects on military readinessIn June 2016 President Barack Obama allowed transgender soldiers to serve openly and receive related medical treatment while ordering the Pentagon to determine a policy for allowing transgender people to join the armed forces within a yearBut Defense Secretary Jim Mattis earlier this year delayed the entry of transgender troops until January 2018 citing the need to further evaluate the impact on the militarys readiness and cohesionThe memorandum comes weeks after Trump abruptly announced the ban It was not immediately implemented by the military which said it would wait for further guidance from the White HouseAfter consultation with my Generals and military experts please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the US Military Trump tweeted Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelmingvictory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entailTrumps initial announcementfrom Democrats and Republicans many of whom said it was discriminatory toward transgender people willing to volunteer to serve their countryAny American who meets current medical and readiness standards should be allowed to continue serving Sen John McCain (R-Ariz) said in a statement issued after Trumps Twitter announcement of the ban There is no reason to force service members who are able to fight train and deploy to leave the military  regardless of their gender identityThe memo released Friday gives the Pentagon six months to determine how to implement Trumps directive as it relates to transgender people currently serving Until that determination is made no action will be taken against any individuals the memo states That plan will be implemented by March 23 2018A senior administration official defended the presidents actions in a call with reporters Friday saying the decision was made based on national security concernsThe basis for this directive is very much our national security needs and things like military readiness effectiveness lethality unit cohesion etcetera said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the details of the policy Hes going to continue to ensure that the rights of the LGBT community as well as all Americans are protectedDemocrats and civil rights groups heavily criticized the announcement calling it a step backwardThe Commander-in-Chief is ordering the Pentagon to hurt and humiliate thousands of Americans who serve in our military with strength and courage House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) said in a statement Prejudice not the national defense is behind President Trumps cruel decision to kick transgender troops out of the militaryThe prohibition on funding sex-reassignment surgeries will also go into effect on March 23 2018 with an exception for individuals currently undergoing the proceduresTrumps decision thrust his administration into a contentious debate about rapidly changing norms around sexual orientation and gender identity The ban on transgender service members was the last such prohibition to be removed after thedont ask dont tell policy toward openly gay and lesbian service members was repealed in 2010Trumps decision was made in part because of strenuous lobbying from  who had threatened to hold up a spending bill with money allocated for a border wall  a key policy priority for the president  if the military was allowed to pay for sex-reassignment surgeriesWhile Trump addressed that issue he also made far more sweeping changes to the militarys policy toward transgender individuals surprising many in his own party and even advocates who opposed allowing transgender people to serveTrumps announcement was followed by no action for weeks and his short-circuiting of the policymaking process on the issue caught military officials by surprisePentagon spokeswomanDana White acknowledged Friday that the Defense Department had received Trumps memorandumMore information will be forthcoming White saidSPICER Morning Thanks for being here (ph) (inaudible) days away from the inauguration of the next president and vice president of the United States Its an opportunity to be here today to allow the president-elect to take your questionsAfter the president-elect makes some remarks he will introduce Ms Sheri Dillon a prominent attorney in Washington DC with the prestigious firm of Morgan Lewis who will -- who structured the agreements pursuant to the presidents business arrangements and she will give brief remarksBefore we start I want to bring your attention to a few points on the report that was published in BuzzFeed last night Its frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a left-wing blog that was openly hostile to the president-elects campaign to drop highly salacious and flat out false information on the internet just days before he takes the oath of officeAccording to BuzzFeeds own editor there are some serious reasons to doubt the allegations in the report The executive editor of the New York Times also dismissed the report by saying it was quote Totally unsubstantiated echoing the concerns that many other reporters expressed on the internetSPICER The fact that BuzzFeed and CNN made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks The report is not an intelligence report plain and simple One issue that the report talked about was the relationship of three individuals associated with the campaign These three individuals Paul Manafort Michael Cohen and Carter PageCarter Page is an individual who the president-elect does not know and was put on notice months ago by the campaign Paul Manafort has adamantly denied any of this involvement and Michael Cohen who is said to have visited Prague in August and September did not leave or enter the United States during this time We asked him to produce his passport to confirm his whereabouts on the dates in question and there was no doubt that he was not in PragueIn fact Mr Cohen has never been in Prague A new report actually suggests that Michael Cohen was at -- at the University of Southern California with his son at a baseball game One report now suggested apparently its another Michael Cohen For all the talk lately about fake news this political witch hunt by some in the media is based on some of the most flimsy reporting and is frankly shameful and disgracefulWith that it is my honor to introduce the next vice president of the United States Mike Pence(APPLAUSE)PENCE We are nine days away from the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States of America(APPLAUSE)I am profoundly honored and humbled that I will take the oath of office to serve as vice president of the United States nine days from today but Im even more honored to stand shoulder to shoulder with a new president who will make America great again(APPLAUSE)Now the president-elects leadership and his energy during the campaign was impressive But as the Chairman of the transition effort I can assure the American people that his energy and his vision during the course of this transition has been even more inspiring To see the way he has brought together men and women of extraordinary capability at a historic pace in this cabinetNineteen of the 21 Cabinet officials have been announced nine committee hearings already scheduled seven more soon to go on the books in the next several days and it is a -- it is a compilation of men and women with an unprecedented caliber of leadership and background to help this administration move our nation forward Perhaps thats why theres been such a concerted effort by some in the mainstream media to delegitimize this election and to demean our incoming administrationYou know I have long been a supporter of a free and independent press and I always will be But with freedom comes responsibility And the irresponsible decision of a few news organizations to run with a false and unsubstantiated report when most news organizations resisted the temptation to propagate this fake news can only be attributed to media bias and attempt to demean the president-elect and our incoming administration and the American people are sick and tired of it(APPLAUSE)But today well get back to real news to real facts and the real progress our incoming president has already made in reviving the American economy and assembling a team that will make America great again And well hear from the president-elect about issues that are of paramount importance to the American people todaySo it is my honor to introduce to all of you my friend and the president-elect of the United States of America Donald Trump(APPLAUSE)TRUMP Thank you very muchIts very familiar territory news conferences because we used to give them on a almost daily basis I think we probably maybe won the nomination because of news conferences and its good to be with youTRUMP We stopped giving them because we were getting quite a bit of inaccurate news but I do have to say that -- and I must say that I want to thank a lot of the news organizations here today because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence agencies Who knows but maybe the intelligence agencies which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that A tremendous blot because a thing like that should have never been written it should never have been had and it should certainly never been releasedBut I want to thank a lot of the news organizations for some of whom have not treated me very well over the years -- a couple in particular -- and they came out so strongly against that fake news and the fact that it was written about by primarily one group and one television stationSo I just want to compliment many of the people in the room I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that But I will tell you there were some news organizations with all that was just said that were so professional -- so incredibly professional that Ive just gone up a notch as to what I think of you OKAll right Weve had some great news over the last couple of weeks Ive been quite active I guess you could say in an economic way for the country A lot of car companies are going to be moving in we have other companies -- big news is going to be announced over the next couple of weeks about companies that are getting building in the MidwestYou saw yesterday Fiat Chrysler big big factory going to be built in this country as opposed to another country Ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion dollar plant in Mexico and theyre going to be moving into Michigan and expanding very substantially an existing plantI appreciate that from Ford I appreciate it very much from Fiat Chrysler I hope that General Motors will be following and I think they will be I think a lot of people will be following I think a lot of industries are going to be coming backWeve got to get our drug industry back Our drug industry has been disastrous Theyre leaving left and right They supply our drugs but they dont make them here to a large extent And the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry because theyre getting away with murderPharma pharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and theres very little bidding on drugs Were the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we dont bid properly and were going to start bidding and were going to save billions of dollars over a period of timeAnd were going to do that with a lot of other industries Im very much involved with the generals and admirals on the airplane the F-35 youve been reading about it And its way way behind schedule and many many billions of dollars over budget I dont like that And the admirals have been fantastic the generals have been fantastic Ive really gotten to know them well And were going to do some big things on the F-35 program and perhaps the F-18 program And were going to get those costs way down and were going to get the plane to be even better And were going to have some competition and its going to be a beautiful thingSo weve been very very much involved and other things We had Jack Ma we had so many incredible people coming here There are no -- theyre going to do tremendous things -- tremendous things in this country And theyre very excitedAnd I will say if the election didnt turn out the way it turned out they would not be here They would not be in my office They would not be in anybody elses office Theyd be building and doing things in other countries So theres a great spirit going on right now A spirit that many people have told me theyve never seen before everWere going to create jobs I said that I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created And I mean that I really -- Im going to work very hard on that We need certain amounts of other things including a little bit of luck but I think were going to do a real job And Im very proud of what weve doneAnd we havent even gotten there yet I look very much forward to the inauguration Its going to be a beautiful event We have great talent tremendous talent And we have the -- all of the bands -- or most of the bands are from the different -- from the different segments of the military And Ive heard some of these bands over the years theyre incredibleWere going to have a very very elegant day The 20th is going to be something that will be very very special very beautiful And I think were going to have massive crowds because we have a movementTRUMP Its a movement like the world has never seen before Its a movement that a lot of people didnt expect And even the polls -- although some of them did get it right but many of them didnt And that was a beautiful scene on November 8th as those states started to pour inAnd we focused very hard in those states and they really reciprocated And those states are gonna have a lot of jobs and theyre gonna have a lot of security Theyre going to have a lot of good news for their veteransAnd by the way speaking of veterans I appointed today the head secretary of the Veterans Administration David Shulkin And well do a news release in a little while Tell you about David hes fantastic -- hes fantastic He will do a truly great jobOne of the commitments I made is that were gonna straighten out the whole situation for our veterans Our veterans have been treated horribly Theyre waiting in line for 15 16 17 days cases where they go in and they have a minor early-stage form of cancer and they cant see a doctor By the time they get to the doctor theyre terminal Not gonna happen its not gonna happenSo David is going to do a fantastic job Were going to be talking to a few people also to help David And we have some of the great hospitals of the world going to align themselves with us on the Veterans Administration like the Cleveland Clinic like the Mayo Clinic a few more than we have And were gonna set up a -- a groupThese are hospitals that have been the top of the line the absolute top of the line And theyre going to get together with their great doctors -- Dr Toby Cosgrove as you know from the Cleveland Clinic has been very involvedIke Perlmutter has been very very involved one of the great men of business And were gonna straighten out the VA for our veterans Ive been promising that for a long time and its something I feel very very stronglySo youll get the information on David And I think youll be very impressed with the job he does We looked long and hard We interviewed at least 100 people some good some not so good But we had a lot of talent And we think this election will be something that will with time -- with time straighten it out and straighten it out for good cause our veterans have been treated very unfairlyOK questions Yes John (ph)QUESTION (Inaudible) so muchTRUMP Thank youQUESTION Appreciate itA couple of aspects of the intelligence briefing that you received on Friday that were looking for further clarification onTRUMP SureQUESTION First of all did the heads of the intelligence agencies provide you with the two-page summary of these unsubstantiated allegations And secondly to that on the broader picture do you accept their opinion that Vladimir Putin ordered the hack of the DNC and the attempted hack of the RNCAnd if you do how will that color your attempts to build a relationship with a leader who has been accused of committing an act of espionage against the United StatesTRUMP OK first of all these readings as you know are confidential classified So Im not allowed to talk about what went on in a meetingAnd -- but we had many witnesses in that meeting many of them with us And I will say again I think its a disgrace that information would be let outI saw the information I read the information outside of that meeting Its all fake news Its phony stuff It didnt happen And it was gotten by opponents of ours as you know because you reported it and so did many of the other people It was a group of opponents that got together -- sick people -- and they put that crap togetherSo I will tell you that not within the meeting but outside of the meeting somebody released it It should have never been -- number one shouldnt have even entered paper But it should have never have been released But I read what was released and I think its a disgrace I think its an absolute disgraceAs far as hacking I think it was Russia But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people And I -- I can say that you know when -- when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently they didnt make a big deal out of that That was something that was extraordinary That was probably ChinaWe had -- we had much hacking going on And one of the things were gonna do we have some of the greatest computer minds anywhere in the world that weve assembled You saw just a sample of it two weeks ago up here where we had the six top people in the world -- they were never in the same room together as a group And were gonna put those minds together and were going to form a defenseTRUMP And I have to say this also the Democratic National Committee was totally open to be hacked They did a very poor job They couldve had hacking defense which we hadAnd I will give Reince Priebus credit because when Reince saw what was happening in the world and with this country he went out and went to various firms and ordered a very very strong hacking defenseAnd they tried to hack the Republican National Committee and they were unable to break throughWe have to do that for our country Its very important(CROSSTALK)QUESTION  just to the last part of that question (inaudible) how could all of this potentially color your attempts to build a better relationship with President PutinTRUMP Well you know President Putin and Russia put out a statement today that this fake news was indeed fake news They said it totally never happenedNow somebody would say Oh of course hes gonna say thatI respected the fact that he said thatAnd I -- Ill be honest I think if he did have something they wouldve released it they wouldve been glad to release itI think frankly had they broken into the Republican National Committee I think they wouldve released it just like they did about Hillary and all of the horrible things that her people like Mr Podesta said about her I mean what he said about her was horribleIf somebody said about me what Podesta said about Hillary I was the boss I wouldve fired him immediately or that person Because what he said about her was horribleBut remember this We talk about the hacking and hackings bad and it shouldnt be done But look at the things that were hacked look at what was learned from that hackingThat Hillary Clinton got the questions to the debate and didnt report it Thats a horrible thing Thats a horrible thingCan you imagine that if Donald Trump got the questions to the debate -- it wouldve been the biggest story in the history of stories And they wouldve said immediately You have to get out of the race Nobody even talked about it Its a very terrible thingYeahQUESTION Can I ask you a question sir(CROSSTALK)QUESTION Thank you Mr President-electOn that intelligence report the second part of their conclusion was that Vladimir Putin ordered it because he aspired to help you in the electionDo you accept that part of the finding And will you undo what President Obama did to punish the Russians for this or will you keep it in placeTRUMP Well if -- if Putin likes Donald Trump I consider that an asset not a liability because we have a horrible relationship with Russia Russia can help us fight ISIS which by the way is number one tricky I mean if you look this administration created ISIS by leaving at the wrong time The void was created ISIS was formedIf Putin likes Donald Trump guess what folks Thats called an asset not a liabilityNow I dont know that Im gonna get along with Vladimir Putin I hope I do But theres a good chance I wont And if I dont do you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me Does anybody in this room really believe that Give me a breakOK(CROSSTALK)QUESTION  President Obama(CROSSTALK)QUESTION  make clear whether during your visits to either Moscow or St Petersburg you engaged in conduct that you now regret and that a reasonable(CROSSTALK)QUESTION Would a reasonable observer say that you are potentially vulnerable to blackmail by Russia or by its intelligence agenciesTRUMP Lemme just tell you what I doWhen I leave our country Im a very high-profile person would you sayI am extremely careful Im surrounded by bodyguards Im surrounded by peopleAnd I always tell them -- anywhere but I always tell them if Im leaving this country Be very careful because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go youre gonna probably have cameras Im not referring just to Russia but I would certainly put them in that categoryAnd number one I hope youre gonna be good anyway But in those rooms you have cameras in the strangest places Cameras that are so small with modern technology you cant see them and you wont know You better be careful or youll be watching yourself on nightly televisionI tell this to people all the timeI was in Russia years ago with the Miss Universe contest which did very well -- Moscow the Moscow area did very very wellAnd I told many people Be careful because you dont wanna see yourself on television Cameras all over the placeAnd again not just Russia all overDoes anyone really believe that storyIm also very much of a germaphobe by the way believe me (LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)QUESTION  how you plan to disentangle yourself from your business But first I have to follow-up on some of these Russian remarksBased on your comments here today do you believe the hacking was justified Does Russia have any leverage over you financial or otherwise And if not will you release your tax returns to prove itTRUMP So I tweeted out that I have no dealings with Russia I have no deals that could happen in Russia because weve stayed away And I have no loans with RussiaAs a real estate developer I have very very little debt I have assets that are -- and now people have found out how big the company is I have very little debt -- I have very low debt But I have no loans with Russia at allAnd I thought that was important to put out I certified that So I have no deals I have no loans and I have no dealings We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to I just dont want to because I think that would be a conflict So I have no loans no dealings and no current pending dealsNow I have to say one other thing Over the weekend I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai with a very very very amazing man a great great developer from the Middle East Hussein Damack a friend of mine great guy And I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai -- a number of deals and I turned it downI didnt have to turn it down because as you know I have a no-conflict situation because Im president which is -- I didnt know about that until about three months ago but its a nice thing to have But I dont want to take advantage of something I have something that others dont have Vice President Pence also has it I dont think hell need it I have a feeling hes not going to need itBut I have a no conflict of interest provision as president It was many many years old this is for presidents Because they dont want presidents getting -- I understand they dont want presidents getting tangled up in minutia they want a president to run the country So I could actually run my business I could actually run my business and run government at the same timeI dont like the way that looks but I would be able to do that if I wanted to I would be the only one to be able to do that You cant do that in any other capacity But as president I could run the Trump organization great great company and I could run the company -- the country Id do a very good job but I dont want to do thatNow all of these papers that you see here -- yes go aheadQUESTION (inaudible) do you believe the hacking was justified And will you release your tax returns to prove what youre saying about no deals in RussiaTRUMP Im not releasing the tax returns because as you know theyre under audit(CROSSTALK)QUESTION  since the 70s has had a required audit from the IRS the last place to release them but as president sirTRUMP You know the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters OK Theyre the only who askQUESTION You dont think the American public is concerned about itTRUMP No I dont think so I won when I became president No I dont think they care at all I dont think they care at all(APPLAUSE)TRUMP I think you care -- I think you care First of all you learn very little to a tax return What you should go down to federal elections and take a look at the numbers And actually people have learned a lot about my company and now they realize my company is much bigger much more powerful than they ever thought Were in many many countries and Im very proud of itAnd what Im going to be doing is my two sons who are right here Don and Eric are going to be running the company They are going to be running it in a very professional manner Theyre not going to discuss it with me Again I dont have to do this Theyre not going to discuss it with me And with that Im going to bring up Sheri Dillon and shes going to go -- these papers are just some of the many documents that Ive signed turning over complete and total control to my sons(CROSSTALK)DILLON Good morning Its my honor and privilege to be here today at President-elect Trumps requestHes asked me as you just heard to speak about the conflicts of interest and the steps hes taking As you know the business empire built by President-elect Trump over the years is massive not dissimilar to the fortunes of Nelson Rockefeller when he became vice president But at that time no one was so concernedPresident-elect Trump wants the American public to rest assured that all of his efforts are directed to pursuing the peoples business and not his own To that end as he explained a few moments ago he directed me and my colleagues at the law firm Morgan Lewis and Bockius to design a structure for his business empire that will completely isolate him from the management of the companyHe further instructed that we build in protections that will assure the American people the decisions he makes and the actions that he takes as president are for their benefit and not to support his financial interestsDILLON As he said hes voluntarily taking this on The conflicts of interest laws simply do not apply to the president or the vice president and they are not required to separate themselves from their financial assets The primary conflicts of interest statutes and some have questioned it is Section 18 USC 208 and its simply inapplicable by its terms And this is not just our interpretation Its Congress itself who have made this clear in 1989 when it amended Section 18 USC 202 to state that except as otherwise provided the terms office and employee in section 208 shall not include the presidentEven so President-elect Trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests He instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit He also sought the guidance of individuals who are familiar with and have worked extensively in the fields of government ethics and constitutional lawCritical to the Morgan Lewis team is Fred Fielding standing here to our side and with us today and many of you have known him He has served several presidents over the years including serving as counsel to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W Bush as well as serving on President George HW Bushs Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform and he also held the position of vice chair of the Ethics Resource CenterMr Fielding has been extensively involved with and approved this plan Hes here today to support the plan and he will continue to provide guidance as the plan is implemented and as Eric Don along with others take over management of the Trump organizationIm gonna detail some of the extraordinary steps now that the president-elect is taking First President-elect Trumps investments and business assets commonly known as the -- as the Trump Organization comprising hundreds of entities which again if you all go and take a look at his financial disclosure statement the pages and pages and pages of entities have all been or will be conveyed to a trust prior to January 20th Here is just some of the paperwork thats taking care of those actionsSecond through the trust agreement he has relinquished leadership and management of the Trump Organization to his sons Don and Eric and a longtime Trump executive Allen Weisselberg Together Don Eric and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump Organization and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by President-elect TrumpFurther at the president-elects direction the trust agreement provides -- that to ensure the Trump Organization continues to operate in accordance with the highest and legal ethics standards an ethics adviser will be appointed to the management team The written approval of the ethics adviser will be required for new deals actions and transactions that could potentially raise ethics or conflicts of interest concernsPresident-elect Trump as well as Don Eric and Allen are committed to ensuring that the activities of the Trump organization are beyond reproach and cannot be perceived to be exploitive of the office of the presidency President-elect Trump will resign from all officer and other positions he holds with the Trump Organization entitiesFurther in addition his daughter Ivanka will have no further involvement with or management authority whatsoever with the Trump Organization As she and Jared move their family to DC Ivanka will focused on settling her children into their new homes and their new schoolsThe president-elect has also already disposed of all of his investments in publicly traded or easily liquidated investments As a result the trust will have two types of assets first it will hold liquid assets Cash cash equivalents and treasuries and perhaps some positions in a government approved diversified portfolio one that is consistent with the regulations from the Office of Government EthicsSecond the trust is going to hold his preexisting illiquid but very valuable business assets the ones that everyone here is familiar with Trump owned operated and branded golf clubs commercial rental property resorts hotels rights to royalties from preexisting licenses of Trump-Marks Productions and Goods Things like Trump Tower Mar-a-Lago all of his other business assets 40 Wall Street will all be in the trustThrough instructions in the trust agreement President-elect trust -- President-elect Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated This impacted more than 30 deals many of which were set to close by the end of 2016 As you can well imagine that caused an immediate financial loss of millions of dollars not just for President-elect Trump but also for Don Ivanka and EricDILLON The trust agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trumps presidency New domestic deals will be allowed but they will go through a vigorous vetting processThe president-elect will have no role in deciding whether the Trump Organization engages in any new deal and he will only know of a deal if he reads it in the paper or sees it on TV Because any new deal could -- and I emphasize could -- be perceived as causing a conflict or as exploiting the office of the presidency new deals must be vetted with the ethics adviser whose role will be to analyze any potential transactions for conflicts and ethics issuesThe ethics adviser will be a recognized expert in the field of government experts Again his role will be to scrutinize the new deals and the actions and any new deal must receive written approvalTo further reinforce the wall that we are building between President-elect Trump and the Trump Organization President-elect Trump has ordered through his trust agreement to sharply limit his information rights Reports will only be available and reflect profit and loss on the company as a whole There will be no separate business by business accountingAnother step that President-elect Trump has taken is he created a new position at the Trump Organization the position of chief compliance counsel whose responsibility will be to ensure that the Trump businesses again are operating at the highest levels of integrity and not taking any actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency He has also directed that no communications of the Trump Organization including social media accounts will reference or be tied to President-elect Trumps role as president of the United States or the office of the presidencyIn sum all of these actions -- complete relinquishment of management no foreign deals ethics adviser approval of deals sharply limited information rights -- will sever President-elect Trumps presidency from the Trump OrganizationSome have asked questions Why not divest Why not just sell everything Form of blind trust And Id like to turn to addressing some of those questions nowSelling first and foremost would not eliminate possibilities of conflicts of interest In fact it would exacerbate them The Trump brand is key to the value of the Trump Organizations assets If President-elect Trump sold his brand he would be entitled to royalties for the use of it and this would result in the trust retaining an interest in the brand without the ability to assure that it does not exploit the office of the presidencyFurther whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutiny Was it too high is there pay for play was it too much pay to curry favor with the president-elect And selling his assets without the rights to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire salePresident-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built This plan offers a suitable alternative to address the concerns of the American people and selling the entire Trump Organization isnt even feasibleSome people have suggested that the president-elect sell the business to his adult children This would require massive third-party debt sourced with multiple lenders whose motives and willingness to participate would be questioned and undoubtedly investigated And if the president-elect were to finance the sale himself he would retain the financial interests in the assets that he owns nowSome people have suggested that the Trump -- that President-elect Trump could bundle the assets and turn the Trump Organization into a public company Anyone who has ever gone through this extraordinarily cumbersome and complicated process knows that it is a non-starter It is not realistic and it would be inappropriate for the Trump OrganizationSome people have suggested a blind trust but you cannot have a totally blind trust with operating businesses President Trump cant unknow he owns Trump Tower and the press will make sure that any new developments at the Trump Organization are well publicizedDILLON Further it would be impossible to find an institutional trustee that would be competent to run the Trump Organization The approach that he is taking allows Don and Eric to preserve this great company and its iconic assets And this approach is best from a conflicts and ethics perspective It creates a complete separation from President-elect Trump -- it separates him and prevents him from participating in the business and poses strict limits on what the trustees can do and requires the assent of any ethics adviser to a new dealIm going to turn to one last topic today that has been of interest lately called emoluments Thats a word I think weve all become familiar with and perhaps had not heard beforeAnd were gonna describe some other actions that President-elect Trump is taking to avoid even the appearance of a conflictEmoluments comes from the Constitution The Constitution says officials may not accept gifts titles of nobility or emoluments from foreign governments with respect to their office and that no benefit should be derived by holding in officeThe so-called Emoluments Clause has never been interpreted however to apply to fair value exchanges that have absolutely nothing to do with an office holderNo one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument Instead it would have been thought of as a value-for-value exchange not a gift not a title and not an emolumentBut since President-elect Trump has been elected some people want to define emoluments to cover routine business transactions like paying for hotel rooms They suggest that the Constitution prohibits the businesses from even arms-length transactions that the president-elect has absolutely nothing to do with and isnt even aware ofThese people are wrong This is not what the Constitution says Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office Its not an emolumentThe Constitution does not require President-elect Trump to do anything here But just like with conflicts of interests he wants to do more than what the Constitution requiresSo President-elect Trump has decided and we are announcing today that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotel to the United States Treasury This way it is the American people who will profitIn sum I and president-elects (sic) other advisers at Morgan Lewis have determined the approach weve outlined today will avoid potential conflicts of interests or concerns regarding exploitation of the office of the presidency without imposing unnecessary and unreasonable loses on the president-elect and his familyWe believe this structure and these steps will serve to accomplish the president-elects desire to be isolated from his business interests and give the American people confidence that his sole business and interest is in making America great again bringing back jobs to this country securing our borders and rebuilding our infrastructureThe American people were well -- well aware of President-elect Trumps business empire and financial interests when they voted Many people voted for him precisely because of his business successPresident-elect Trump wants to bring this success to all Americans Thank you(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)DILLON Youre welcome My pleasure Yes (ph) Dont want to lose your note Thank youTRUMP Thank you very much Here you go you (ph)DILLON Thank youQUESTION Mr Trump Thank you Mr Trump (inaudible) from America NewsWhat is your response to your critics that say not only you but also your Cabinet is filled with conflicts of interestAnd do you plan to set an example in the future to make sure that your -- your Cabinet and everyone throughout your administration(CROSSTALK)TRUMP I -- I really think that when you watch whats going on with whats happening in -- I was just watching as an example Rex Tillerson I think its brilliant what hes doing and what hes sayingI watched yesterday as you know our great senator who is going to be a great attorney general And he was brilliant And what people dont know is that he was a great prosecutor and attorney general in Alabama And he was brilliant yesterdaySo I really think that they are -- I think we have one of the great Cabinets ever put together And weve been hearing that from so many people People are so happyYou know in the case of Rex he ran incredibly Exxon Mobil When there was a find he would get it When they needed something he would be thereA friend of mine whos very very substantial in the oil business Harold Hamm -- big supporter -- he said theres nobody in the business like Rex TillersonAnd thats what we want Thats what I want to bring to governmentI want to bring the greatest people into government because were way behind We dont make good deals any more I say it all the time in speeches We dont make good deals anymore we make bad deals Our trade deals are a disasterTRUMP We have hundreds of billions of dollars of losses on a yearly basis -- hundreds of billions with China on trade and trade imbalance with Japan with Mexico with just about everybody We dont make good deals anymoreSo we need people that are smart we need people that are successful and they got successful because generally speaking theyre smart And thats what Id put Im very proud of the Cabinet I think theyre doing very wellIts very interesting how its going but its -- I think theyre doing very very well(CROSSTALK)QUESTION  a quick follow-up on -- on Russia sirQUESTION Thank you Mr President-elect I wanted to ask a few questions on ObamacareTRUMP YeahQUESTION Can you be specific on what guidance youre giving congressional Republicans on the timeline for repeal and replace whether it needs to be simultaneous or(CROSSTALK)TRUMP Finally Obamacare I thought it was never gonna be askedQUESTION (OFF-MIKE) though if you have outlined a plan for what you want the replace package to look like would it guarantee coverage for those who have gotten health insurance through the current Obamacare lawTRUMP Youre gonna be very very proud as not only the media and reporters youre gonna be very proud of what we put forth having to do with health care Obamacare is a complete and total disasterThey can say what they want they can guide you anyway they wanna guide you In some cases they guide you incorrectly In most cases you realize whats happened its imploding as we sitSome states have over a hundred percent increase and 17 and I said this two years ago 17 is going to be the bad year Its going to be catastrophic Frankly we could sit back and it was a thought from a political standpoint but it wouldnt be fair to the peopleWe could sit back and wait and watch and criticize and we could be a Chuck Schumer and sit back and criticize it and people would come they would come begging to us please we have to do something about Obamacare We dont wanna own it we dont wanna own it politically They own it right nowSo the easiest thing would be to let it implode in 17 and believe me wed get pretty much whatever we wanted but it would take a long time Were going to be submitting as soon as our secretarys approved almost simultaneously shortly thereafter a planItll be repeal and replace It will be essentially simultaneously It will be various segments you understand but will most likely be on the same day or the same week but probably the same day could be the same hourSo were gonna do repeal and replace very complicated stuff And were gonna get a health bill passed were gonna get health care taken care of in this country You have deductibles that are so high that after people go broke paying their premiums which are going through the roof the health care cant even be used by them because their deductibles bills are so highObamacare is the Democrats problem We are gonna take the problem off the shelves for them Were doing them a tremendous service by doing it We could sit back and let them hang with it We are doing the Democrats a great serviceSo as soon as our secretary is approved and gets into the office well be filing a plan And it was actually pretty accurately reported today The New York Times And the plan will be repeal and replace ObamacareWere going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better OK(CROSSTALK)QUESTION President-elect can we just ask you -- sir sirQUESTION President-elect Trump(CROSSTALK)QUESTION Mr President -- which oneTRUMP I was going right here(CROSSTALK)QUESTION President-elect Trump Jon Steinberg (ph) from Cheddar When you look at all the meetings that youve had with Carrier SoftBank and Alibaba do you conceive of making this a program maybe sitting inside of commerceAnd then my follow-up question to that is how soon will we see the program on capital repatriation and corporate tax cutsTRUMP Well if I can save jobs for instance I was doing individual companies and people said well thats only one company like we did a good job with Carrier And I wanna thank United Technologies which owns Carrier but we saved close to a thousand jobsAnd they were gone and Mike Pence and his staff really helped us a lot But those were -- that was a tough one because they announced a year and a half before that they were leaving so its always tough when theyre building a plan just a little tougher than before they start or before they make an announcementTRUMP So I wanna thank United Technologies But weve been meeting with a lot of companies But what really is happening is the word is now out that when you want to move your plant to Mexico or some other place and you want to fire all of your workers from Michigan and Ohio and all these places that I won for good reason its not going to happen that way anymoreYou want to move your plant and you think as an example youre going to build that plant in Mexico and youre going to make your air conditioners or your cars or whatever youre making and youre going to sell it through what will be a very very strong border -- not a weak border like it is -- we dont even have a border Its an open sieveBut youre going to sell through a very strong border -- not going to happen Youre going to pay a very large border tax So if you want to move to another country and if you want to fire all of our great American workers that got you there in the first place you can move from Michigan to Tennessee and to North Carolina and South Carolina You can move from South Carolina back to MichiganYou can do anywhere -- youve got a lot of states at play a lot of competition So its not like oh gee Im taking the competition away Youve got a lot of places you can move And I dont care as along as its within the United States the borders of the United StatesThere will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder And if our politicians had what it takes they would have done this years ago And youd have millions more workers right now in the United States that are -- 96 million really wanting a job and they cant get You know that story The real number -- thats the real numberSo thats the way it is OK Go aheadQUESTION President-elect I have a question about the Supreme Court and border security But I also wanted to ask you about something you said on Twitter this morning Are we living in Nazi Germany What were you driving at there Do you have a problem with the intelligence communityAnd on the Supreme Court whats your timeline You said a while ago you were down to four Have you conducted those interviews yet Whats your timeline for nominatingAnd on the border fence it now appears clear US taxpayers will have to pay for it up front What is your plan toTRUMP Thats not clear at all OK(CROSSTALK)QUESTION  to get Mexico to pay for itTRUMP Ive got it Do you have any more(LAUGHTER)On the fence -- its not a fence Its a wall You just misreported it Were going to build a wall I could wait about a year-and-a-half until we finish our negotiations with Mexico which will start immediately after we get to office but I dont want to wait Mike Pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through Congress for the wall to beginI dont feel like waiting a year or a year-and-a-half Were going to start building Mexico in some form and there are many different forms will reimburse us and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall That will happen whether its a tax or whether its a payment -- probably less likely that its a payment But it will happenSo remember this OK I would say we are going to build a wall and people would go crazy I would then say who is going to pay for the wall And people would all scream out -- 25000 30000 people because nobody has ever had crowds like Trump has had You know that You dont like to report that but thats OKOK now he agrees Finally he agreesBut I say who is going to pay for the wall And they will scream out MexicoNow reports went out last week -- oh Mexico is not going to pay for the wall because of a reimbursement Whats the difference I want to get the wall started I dont want to wait a year-and-a-half until I make my deal with Mexico And we probably will have a deal sooner than thatAnd by the way Mexico has been so nice so nice I respect the government of Mexico I respect the people of Mexico I love the people of Mexico I have many people from Mexico working for me Theyre phenomenal peopleThe government of Mexico is terrific I dont blame them for whats happened I dont blame them for taking advantage of the United States I wish our politicians were so smart Mexico has taken advantage of the United States I dont blame the representatives and various presidents et cetera of Mexico What I say is we shouldnt have allowed that to happen Its not going to happen anymoreSo in order to get the wall started Mexico will pay for the wall but it will be reimbursed OKSupreme Court judge So as you know I have a list of 20 Ive gone through them Weve met with numerous candidates Theyre outstanding in every case They were largely recommended and highly recommended by Federalist Society Jim DeMint was also very much involved and his group which is fantastic and hes a fantastic guyTRUMP So between Leo and Jim DeMint and some senators and some congresspeople we have a great group of people Ill be making the decision on who we will put up for justice of the United States Supreme Court a replacement for the great great Justice Scalia That will be probably within two weeks of the 20th So within about two weeks probably the second week I consider the first day because well also be doing some -- some pretty good signings and I think what well do is well wait until MondayThat will be our really first business day as opposed to doing it on Friday because on Friday people are going to have a very good time at the inauguration and then Saturday as you know were having a big church service and lots of good things are happening So our first day -- and youll all be invited to the signings but well be doing some pretty good signings on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday and then also the next week And youre all invitedBut on the Supreme Court Ill be making that decision and it will be a decision which I very strongly believe in I think its one of the reasons I got elected I think the people of this country did not want to see what was happening with the Supreme Court so I think it was a very very big decision as to why I was electedQUESTION The tweet that you had this morning about are we living in Nazi Germany what were you driving at there What are you trying to tell the American publicTRUMP I think it was disgraceful -- disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out I think its a disgrace and I say that -- and I say that and thats something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do I think its a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the publicAs far as Buzzfeed which is a failing pile of garbage writing it I think theyre going to suffer the consequences They already are And as far as CNN going out of their way to build it up -- and by the way we just found out I was coming down Michael Cohen -- I was being -- Michael Cohen is a very talented lawyer Hes a good lawyer in my firm It was just reported that it wasnt this Michael Cohen they were talking about So all night long its Michael CohenI said I want to see your passport He brings his passport to my office I say hey wait a minute He didnt leave the country He wasnt out of the country They had Michael Cohen of the Trump Organization was in Prague It turned out to be a different Michael Cohen Its a disgrace what took place Its a disgrace and I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael CohenQUESTION Since youre attacking us can you give us a question Mr President-elect --TRUMP Go aheadQUESTION Mr President-elect since you are attacking our news organizationTRUMP Not youQUESTION Can you give us a chanceTRUMP Your organization is terribleQUESTION You are attacking our news organization can you give us a chance to ask a question sir Sir can youTRUMP QuietQUESTION Mr President-elect can you

think of Lindsey Grahams plan to send you a bill forTRUMP Plans to send me a bill for whatQUESTION Tougher sanctionsTRUMP I hadnt heard Lindsey Graham was going to do that Lindsey Graham Ive been competing with him for a long time He is going to crack that one percent barrier one day I didnt realize Lindsey Graham is still at it Thats all right I think Lindsey Graham is a nice guy Ive heard that he is a nice guy and Ive been hearing itGo ahead Go ahead Youve been waitingQUESTION As far as we understand the intelligence communityTRUMP Stand upQUESTION From BBC news Ian Pannell from BBC newsTRUMP BBC news Thats another beautyQUESTION Thank you Thank youAs far as we understand it the intelligence community are still looking at these allegations this false news as you describe it If they come back with any kind of conclusion that any of it stands up that any of it is true will you consider your positionTRUMP Theres nothing they could come back withQUESTION Can youTRUMP Go aheadQUESTION (inaudible) published fake news and all the problems that weve seen throughout the media over the course of the election what reforms do you recommend for this industry hereTRUMP Well I dont recommend reforms I recommend people that are -- that have some moral compassYou know Ive been hearing more and more about a thing called fake news and theyre talking about people that go and say all sorts of things But I will tell you some of the media outlets that I deal with are fake news more so than anybody I could name them but I wont bother but you have a few sitting right in front of us Theyre very very dishonest people but I think its just something were going to have to live withTRUMP I guess the advantage I have is that I can speak back When it happens to somebody that doesnt have this -- doesnt have that kind of a megaphone they cant speak back Its a very sad thing Ive seen people destroyed Ive seen people absolutely destroyed And I think its very unfair So all I can ask for is honest reportersYes(CROSSTALK)QUESTION I just wanted to follow up on the questions about the US intelligence community And be very clear about what youre saying Do you trust your US intelligence officials And what do you say to foreign policy experts who say youre actually weakening national security by waging this war of words against that communityTRUMP Intelligence agencies are vital and very very important We are going to be putting in as you know Mr Pompeo and others you know the Senator Dan Coats Were going to be putting in some outstanding people Within 90 days theyre going to be coming back to me with a major report on hackingI want them to cover this situation I also want them however to cover maybe most importantly -- because were hacked by everybody -- you know the United States our government out of a list of 17 in terms of industries is the worst its number 17 in terms of protectionIf you look at the retail industry if you look at the banking industry various industries out of 17 industries -- they put this in the category of an industry -- the United States is last in terms of protecting lets say hacking defense Like we had a great hacking defense at the Republican National CommitteeThats why we werent hacked By the way we were told that they were trying to hack us but they werent able to hack And I think I get some credit because I told Reince and Reince did a phenomenal job but I said I want strong hacking defenseThe Democratic National Committee didnt do that Maybe thats why the country runs so badly that way But I will tell you -- wait -- wait -- wait let me finish Within 90 days we will be coming up with a major report on hacking defense how do we stop this new phenomena -- fairly new phenomena because the United States is hacked by everybodyThat includes Russia and China and everybody -- everybody OK(CROSSTALK)TRUMP Go ahead -- go aheadQUESTION Mr President-elect you said just now that you believe Russia indeed was responsible for the hacking of the DNC and Jon Podestas e-mails et ceteraTRUMP All right but you know what it could have been others alsoQUESTION But why did you spend weeks undermining US intelligence community before simply getting the facts and then making a public statementTRUMP Well I think its pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press I think its pretty sad First of all its illegal You know these are -- these are classified and certified meetings and reportsIll tell you what does happen I have many meetings with intelligence And every time I meet people are reading about it Somebodys leaking it out So theres -- maybe its my office Maybe in my office because I have a lot of people a lot of great people Maybe its them And what I did is I said I wont tell anybody Im going to have a meeting and I wont tell anybody about my meeting with intelligenceAnd what happened is I had my meeting Nobody knew not even Rhona my executive assistant for years she didnt know -- I didnt tell her Nobody knew The meeting was had the meeting was over they left And immediately the word got out that I had a meetingSo I dont want that -- I dont want that Its very unfair to the country Its very unfair to our country whats happened That report should have never -- first of all it shouldnt have been printed because its not worth the paper its written on And I thank the New York Times for saying thatI thank a lot of different people for saying that But I will tell you that should never ever happen OK(CROSSTALK)QUESTION Thank you Mr President-elect can you stand here today once and for all and say that no one connected to you or your campaign had any contact with Russia leading up to or during the presidential campaign And if you do indeed believe that Russia was behind the hacking what is your message to Vladimir Putin right nowTRUMP He shouldnt be doing it He wont be doing it Russia will have much greater respect for our country when Im leading than when other people have led it You will see that Russia will respect our country more He shouldnt have done it I dont believe that he will be doing it more nowWe have to work something out but its not just Russia Take a look at whats happened You dont report it the same way 22 million accounts were hacked in this country by China And thats because we have no defense Thats because were run by people that dont know what theyre doingTRUMP Russia will have far greater respect for our country when Im leading it and I believe and I hope -- maybe it wont happen its possible But I wont be giving (ph) a little reset button like Hillary Here press this piece of plastic A guy looked at her like what is she doing Theres no reset button Were either going to get along or were not I hope we get along but if we dont thats possible tooBut Russia and other countries -- and other countries including China which has taken total advantage of us economically totally advantage of us in the South China Sea by building their massive fortress total Russia China Japan Mexico all countries will respect us far more far more than they do under past administrationsI want to thank everybody So this is all -- just so you understand these papers -- because Im not sure that was explained properly But these papers are all just a piece of the many many companies that are being put into trust to be run by my two sons that I hope at the end of eight years Ill come back and say oh you did a good job Otherwise if they do a bad job Ill say Youre firedGood-bye everybody Good-byeThere is a lot to unpack in this statement by the White House spokeswoman part of an administration effort to deflect attention on the Trump campaign during the sprawling investigation into Russian meddling in the US election President Trump has also tweeted an article about the mysterious firm Fusion GPS as he decried a witch hunt by DemocratsIn other words Russia was against Trump in the 2016 Election  and why not I want strong military & low oil prices Witch Hunt  Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) What is Fusion GPS and do Sanderss claim hold water This is a complicated tale making it easy for the White House to try to stir up a little fogIf this were a novel one mightsay it was not a credible plot twist  that the same firm that helped inspire a salacious Russian dossier on the incoming president was also working on behalf of Russian-linked interests at the time But hey this is Washington While there are many lobbying or research firms with a certain ideological orientation some operate like law firms doing specific work on behalf of a client who hires itFusion GPS was started by a group of former Wall Street Journal reporters notably investigative reporter Glenn R Simpson He co-wrote  about how lobbyists and other Washington insiders were earning big fees representing former Soviet officials-turned-businessmen The firm  it provides premium research strategic intelligence and due diligence services to corporations law firms and investors worldwide In other words the ex-reporters have leveraged their reporting skills into a profit-making enterpriseHeres how Fusion ended up in the middle of the story Fusions many clients in recent years included a law firm and a Republican donor The donor concerned about the rise of Donald Trump wanted opposition research on the businessman The law firm Baker & Hotstetler needed help on litigation defending a Russia-owned company [ The Republican donor  a conservative website financially supported by GOP megadonor Paul Singer]The Republican donor hired Fusion in September 2015  But once Trump won the Republican nomination the GOP donor lost interest But in spring 2016 Fusion was able to persuade donors to Hillary Clinton to keep funding the research [ The Washington Post  that the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee funded the research]Fusion in June hired Christopher Steele a former MI6 agent known for his contacts in Russia and Steele produced a series of salacious memos claiming the Kremlin had the goods to blackmail Trump which made its way to reporters members of Congress and the FBI The FBI considered Steeles work credible enough that it  though the planned arrangement fell apart after the dossier became publicMeanwhile Fusion had been hired by Baker Hotstetler in early 2014 to assist on the defense against a civil action filed by the USgovernment alleging fraud by Prevezon Holdings In 2013 authoritiesaccused Prevezon of receiving proceeds of a scheme to  and laundering the ill-gotten funds by buying real estate in Manhattan Prevezon is owned by Denis Katsyv the son of a senior Russian government officialHermitage Capital Management the alleged victim of the fraud is headed by William Browder once a top investor in Russia who had a falling out with the Russian government Browder had hired Sergei Magnitsky a Russian tax accountant to investigate analleged theft from his Russian companies but Magnitsky was arrested and died in prison in 2009 under suspicious circumstances Browders advocacy of Magnitskys case led Congress to pass the 2012 Magnitsky Act which bars Russian officials believed to be involved in the lawyers death from entering the United States or using its banking system In response Russia blocked US parents from adopting Russian childrenSo two different clients two different deals for Fusion But then the story lines mergedSteeles work for Fusion centered on Trumps business dealings in Russia And people working for Prevezon  and opposed to the Magnitsky Act  met with Trump campaign officials at the Trump Tower in June 2016 including Donald Trump Jr campaign manager Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner the husband of Ivanka Trump Trump Jr agreed to meet with Natalia Veselnitskaya after an intermediary promised dirt on Clinton (The participants claim most of the discussions centered on the adoption ban imposed in response to the Magnitsky Act)Veselnitskaya was also working for Baker Hotstetler on the Prevezon case  In addition she sought to help Prevezon fan opposition against the Magnitsky sanctions Shortly after her meeting at Trump Tower she attended a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Russian sanctions and a screening at the Newseum of a film attacking the Magnitsky Act Another person at the Trump Tower meeting was Rinat Akhmetshin who was once registeredas for a group called the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative which  it wanted to help restart American adoption of Russian children Itwas housed in  Denis Katsyv the owner of Prevezon was  as one of the Russians who controlled the organization which no longer seems to existSo what was Fusions work on the Prevezon case Prevezon soughtto turn the tables on Browder the governments main witness by arguingMagnitsky aidedhim in fraud rather than exposing crimes So Fusion was tasked to find information to  that Browder had told lawmakers and US government officials about the Magnitsky case according to statements the firm has made Simpson and his firm found records on Browders property and finances and tracked down potential witnesses Fusion Politico in December 2016 Fusion GPS also discussed the case record with several reporters according to the statementInformation uncovered by Fusion as part of the litigation also became part of the anti-Magnitsky campaign In 2016 Browder  with the Justice Department accusing Fusion of failing to register as a lobbyist for a foreign interest under the  Fusion said in that it complied with the law and worked for and under the supervision of an American law firm to provide support for civil litigation in New York and thus was not requiredto register under FARA In other words the work product was for the litigation not anylobbying As far as we can determine there is littleevidence Fusion itself was involved in the anti-Magnitsky advocacy even if the fruits of its research may have aided foes of the Magnitsky lawBrowder suggeststhe timing of Fusions activities is questionableHe said Fusion contacted reporters between April and June 2016 when lobbying activity against the expansion of the Magnitsky law was in full swing The court case however was still pendingFARA is weakly enforced but two former Trump aides Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn are under investigation for allegedly failing to comply with FARA So one can see the White Houses interest in raising allegations of FARA fraud Whether Fusion should have registered for FARA is now  While there is an exemption in FARA for certain legal work that exemption does not apply to public relations workIn the end a federal appeals court in late 2016  Baker Hotstetler to end its representation because of a conflict of interest (a lawyer at the firm had previously represented Hermitage) That apparently also ended Fusions involvement Prevezon settled the case in May for $6 million with no admission of wrongdoing in what both sides claimed was a victory (The United States had sought to seize assets worth as much as $24 million) The competing claims were never litigated though NBC News in July  raised by Prevezons defense teamWhew we told you it was complex Now lets look back at Sanderss statement The Democrat-linked firm Fusion GPS actually took money from the Russian government while it created the phony dossier thats been the basis for all of the Russia scandal fake newsAs we noted Fusions original client for the Trump opposition research was said to have been a Republican Fusions client list is not public but critical news reports have cited Fusions work  in 2015 and against  We could find no record of political contributions by Simpson though one of his partners Peter R Fristch made two $500 contributions to Hillary Clinton campaign committees in 2016 according to Federal Election Commission records But that does not necessarily mean the firm works only on behalf of Democrats or is Democrat-linked Obviously it would be helpful to learn who bankrolled the opposition research on Trumps business dealingsMoreover there is no evidence Fusion took money from the Russian government It worked on behalf of an American law firm which was hired by a company owned by a Russian whose father is a government official Even Browder a fierce critic of Fusion said in an interview the White House is conflating two issuesFinally Fusions hiring of Steele to produce the dossier was for a different client not the Russian government US intelligence agencies raised warnings about the Russian efforts to influence the election long before the dossier became public So the dossier is not the source of Russia scandal fake newsAmong its many clients Fusion had two with starkly different goalsOne client wanted dirt on Donald Trumps business deals especially in Russia which would be potentially damaging to Russias interests because US intelligence agencies concludedRussia wantedto give Trump an edge in the electionAnother client wanted help in defending a lawsuit  and Fusions research ended up aligning with Russias efforts to reverse US sanctionsIt may not look very pretty but this is Washington Hired guns work for whoever pays the billsIn any case Sanderss spinfalls flat There were Russian entitiesinvolved but there is currently no evidence that the Russian government paidfor Fusions work on the Prevezon defense at the same time Fusion investigated Trumps business dealings in Russia We will update this account if more information emerges during the Senate investigation of Fusion but for now she earns Three Pinocchios On Aug 10 President Trump uttered this claimAdditionally it seems that Russia spent a lot of money on that false report and that was Russian money and I think it was Democrat money too You could say that was collusion That would be worthy of Four Pinocchios()Do you rate this claim as true or false More Pinocchios for false

its long-standing ban on transgender men and women serving openly in the military At the time Defense Secretary Ashton B Carter  Our mission is to defend this country and we dont want barriers unrelated to a persons qualification to serve preventing us from recruiting  We have to have access to 100 percent of Americas population for our all-volunteer force to be able to recruit from among them the most highly qualifiedThat plan studied extensively was meant to be fully implemented by July 1This morning President Trump reversed that policyAfter consultation with my Generals and military experts please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the US Military Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail Thank you Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) But would allowing transgender people to serve openly in the military create disruptionTheres no evidence that thats trueEighteencountries allowtransgender personnel to serve openly in the military includingAustralia Israel Britain Sweden and Canada None of these countries reported experiencing ill effects fromopening uptheir armed services to the transgender community They all said the same thing which is that inclusive policy has not in any way compromised military readiness And thats really important Palm Center director Aaron Belkin  The Palm Center put out an extensive report on this issue in 2015In fact the US military studied how other countries tackled the change before drawing up its recommendationsby Rand Corp which the Pentagon cited in its decision to lift the banlooked closely at four countries IsraelBritain Canada and Australia Researchers found that while there is limited research on the effects of transgender personnel serving openly in foreign militaries the available evidence indicated no significant effect on cohesion operational effectiveness or readinessIn fact they said that when they talked to British officers somereported that increases in diversity had led to increases in readiness and performance Interviews with these same commanders also found no effect on cohesion though there were some reports of resistance to the policy change within the general military population which led to a less-than-welcoming environment for transgender personnelOf course the specifics of integration lookdifferent depending on the country In most places transgender troops must undergo hormone therapy or surgery before they can serve In Argentina transgender service members arent required to undergo surgery or receive an expert opinion before officially changing their genderThe armed services inthe Netherlands Canada and Australia will pay for hormonal and surgical treatments but only after the service member receives approval from a doctorIn Britain individuals must live as their target gender for two years before they are granted legal recognitionIn Israel where military service is mandatory to support transgender recruitsDifferent countries offer different accommodations for service members who transition once theyare already in the military In Britain theyre offered a new uniform at the start of the transition process along with new photos and ID cards bearing their new names A  by the Royal Australian Air Force (deemed the gold standard by experts) advises commanders to use common sense When it comes to questions about housing and bathrooms it suggests relatively intuitive solutions such as using shower curtainsand ensuring individual stalls are available when necessaryTransgender people are not barred from specific jobs in any of the services where they can serve openly though they are often required to pass fitness tests for the gender they have transitioned toPresident Trump on Thursday condemned the violence by the anti-fascist protest movement known as antifa saying their tactics around the country have proved him right for denouncing bad actors on both sides of the racially charged clashes with white supremacists in Charlottesville last monthTrump said he explained his views on antifa to Sen Tim Scott (R-SC) during their private meeting at the White House a day earlier Scott had expressed disgust with Trumps handling of the Charlottesville aftermathWe had a great talk yesterday Trump said during an on-record discussion with reporters on Air Force One en route to Washington aftera trip to view hurricane-relief efforts in Naples Fla I think especially in light of the advent of antifa if you look at whats going on there you have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also and essentially thats what I said  The president added that because of whats happened since then with antifa when you look at really whats happened since Charlottesville a lot of people are saying and people have actually written Gee Trump may have a point I said theres some very bad people on the other side alsoTrump faced widespread political backlash after he waited two days to specifically condemn the hate groups including the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis that organized the Unite the Right rally Violent clashes on the streets culminated in the death of a woman who was killed when a man participating in the rally plowed his car into a group of counterprotestersEven after denouncing the hate groups by name Trump within days mounted a defense of his initial response asserting there were very fine people among the marchers and suggesting both sides were to blame for the violenceTrump said Scott presented legislation he was working on to help create jobs and put people to work which Trump said he supported Asked whether the senator had pressed him to add high-ranking African Americans to his White House staff and administration Trump said We did talk about that yeah Its something I do and I certainly would continue to do We talked about that I told him I would do it and he knows weve already done it But I told him and I told him very strongly I like thatThe president was not specific about whom he might hire or when or for what positionsLater Thursday the White House announced that Trump had signed legislation condemning the Charlottesville violence and hate groupsTrump issued a statement saying he was pleased to sign itAs Americans we condemn the recent violence in Charlottesville and oppose hatred bigotry and racism in all forms Trump saidNo matter the color of our skin or our ethnic heritage we all live under the same laws we all salute the same great flag and we are all made by the same almighty God We are a Nation founded on the truth that all of us are created equal As one people let us move forward to rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as AmericansOn Sunday night The Washington Post reported that President Trumps private business was  in Russia in late 2015 only to abandon it shortly before the 2016 presidential primaries The revelation adds a new layer of context to Trumps repeated insistence over the past year that he has no business ties to the country suggesting that his avowed indifference toward making money in Russia was a function less of resolve than of circumstanceBroadly Trumps attitude toward business in Russia mirrors his behavior when it comes to Russian President Vladimir Putin Before he was a political candidate Trump repeatedly said that he had a relationship with the Russian president (Among the examples he cited as evidence he knew Putin They were both on the same episode of 60 Minutes  though Trump was filmed in the United States and Putin in Russia) After that relationship became politically inconvenient his  In the third presidential debate he  responded to a question about Russian interference in the election by saying I

haters are going crazy  yet Obama can make a deal with Iran #1 in terror no problem Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Trump has his attorneys release a summary of his business dealings with Russia[Y]our tax returns do not reflect (1) any income of any type from Russian sources the letter  (2) any debt owed by you or [The Trump Organization (TTO)] to Russian lenders or any interest paid by you or TTO to Russian lenders (3) any equity investments by Russian persons or entities in entities controlled by you or TTO or (4) any equity or debt investments by you or TTO in Russian entitiesBut the first part of that paragraph is what seizes the publics imagination That lack of business dealings holds true the lawyers say [w]ith few exceptionsThe exceptions are the sale of the house in Palm Beach and the Miss Universe pageant But that those were the only exceptions was not it seems for lack of tryingThe Trump White House has tried to point the finger at the Obama administration for its travails with retired Lt Gen Michael Flynn whom the president fired as national security adviser just three weeks after taking the oath of office Flynn was fired after The Washington Post  that he had misled other administration officials including Vice President Pence about whether he had discussed pending sanctions with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transitionFormer acting attorney general Sally Yates testified May 8 that she had informed the White House counsel on Jan 26 that Flynn was possibly compromised in his dealings with Russia because he had lied about the nature of the conversations But Trump took no action  after The Post revelations The White House acknowledged that President Barack Obama    had warned Trump not to choose Flynn as national security adviserSo what were the circumstances of his clearanceThe federal government is a very big place The White House should not necessarily assume that political appointees know everything that is happening across the bureaucracy (Perhaps they have figured this out by now)In this case Flynns clearance was a routine matter said Jim Kudla a DIA spokesman Flynn had left the agency but the practice there is that all former DIA directors should keep a clearance so the current director is able to have a discussion with former directors about classified matters that might require insight from a previous directorFlynns clearance at DIA comes up for renewal every five years and so in January 2016 he filed the necessary paperwork Kudla said the clearance was only for Defense Department matters It was not so General Flynn could go to other agencies asking for classified information he said Each agency would be required to determine whether to allowaccess to classified materials Kudlanoted that at the time it was being renewed early in 2016 he was not in the political sphere he subsequently becameFlynn in February told CNN he had been advising Trump on a range of issues At one point Trump As part of the clearance renewal Kudla said an applicant is asked about foreign travel and foreign contacts Kudla said that there are a couple of questions about foreign financial interests such as stock investments but asking about payments for a foreign speech is not part of the clearance processSeparately he noted Flynn as a former Army officer is supposed to receive permission from the secretary of the Army and the secretary of state before accepting payments from foreign governments Flynns lawyer has said that as part of the clearance review he disclosed his attendance at a 2015 event in Moscow organized by Russia Today a government-linked news organization that US consider to be a propaganda front But lawmakers  when he did not disclose $45000 that he received from appearing at the 2015 event and nearly $34000 from RTMost of the security clearance process deals with questions of character and trustworthiness (though it also includes consideration of possible foreign allegiance) said Steven Aftergood director of the project on government secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists It does not address questions of competence or policy judgment He noted that in light of concerns about Russian election-tampering General Flynns record of interactions with Russian entities took on a new significance that they did not have in 2015White House officials acknowledge that Flynn was still awaiting a CIA clearance when he was fired by Trump At the time he was fired Flynn had an interim clearance in order to allow him to do his jobI know what I went through as a political appointee twice in a Republican and a Democratic administration said James R Clapper Jr the former director of national intelligence in testimony on May 8 And the vetting process for either a political appointee or someone working in the White House is far far more invasive and far far more thorough than a standard TS/SCI clearance process (TS/SCI refers to Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information the clearance level Flynn held at DIA)Flynns security clearance was a routine matter done mainly to benefit the head of the DIA and it did not rise to a political level So Trump and other White House officials are engaging in a distraction when they suggest that Obama failed to take action against FlynnObama actually fired Flynn because of perceived management flaws Its unclear exactly what Obama told Trump in private but that  given the central role the national security adviser has in coordinating US foreign policy The concerns about Flynns dealings with Russia came only later after US intelligence realized he was discussing US sanctions with the Russians and then misleading other US officials about the nature of his conversations He also did not disclose his payment from RT to government officials until after he was fired by Trump() Do you rate this claim as true or false More Pinocchios for false fewer based on

octopuses  which he said arecharacterized by a single row of suckers along the armsHe said there could be several reasons that they moved on to the beach including spawning weather andwater temperaturesJames Wright curator at the National Marine Aquarium in the United Kingdom and  that the number of octopuses seen on the same beach at the same time is quite oddBut them even being found in the intertidal is not common and suggests there is something wrong with them I am afraid he saidAs the areas where they are exhibiting this odd behavior coincides with the two areas hit by the two recent low-pressure depressions and associated storms of Ophelia and Brian it could be supposed that these have affected themIt could simply be injuries sustained by the rough weather itself or there could be a sensitivity to a change in atmospheric pressureVitaly Sych the editor of the Ukrainian weekly Novoye Vremya had readied a profile for only one candidate Hillary Clinton to run once the results came in after what he called the most closely watched US election by Ukrainians of all timeThen came the bombshell that echoed all the way from the Potomac to the DnieperAMERICA PLAYS THE FOOL was the headline looming above a portrait of Donald Trump the next day (Sychs colleagues talked him down from his first choice A boor an ignoramus and a racist Meet the new president of the United States)The major emotion here is anxiety and concern because he really said all those things so he must believe some of them Sych saidAmong those things he said He would befriend Russian President Vladimir Putin who is not going into Ukraine and The people of Crimea from what Ive heard would rather be with Russia than where they were As to lifting US sanctions on Russia We would be looking at thatAnd then theres former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort whose previous job was as political spin doctor for ousted  and reviled  Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych now hiding in RussiaIf Russia was rooting for a Trump victory on election night it stands to reason who wasnt The big loser of the election is Ukraine tweeted Michael McFaul the former US ambassador to MoscowIn private some Ukrainian politicians agreed One lawmaker said the concern was a primal fear of losing support in the face of Russian aggression Pressed about Trumps statement on Crimea Oksana Syroyid a deputy chairman of Ukraines parliament said I resent that I hope that since the campaign is over hell reconsider But one week after the election the truth is that nobody here in government wants to discuss the things Trump said about Ukraine Necessity in this case dictates thick skin and a timely bout of amnesia as Kiev looks to make its case to the president-elect and his Republican Party Trump and President Petro Poroshenko spoke for the first time on Tuesday and Ukrainian officials optimistically are hoping to arrange a meeting between the two in New York in February when Ukraine chairs the UN Security CouncilI see it as a challenge with a plus said Victoria Voytsitska a member of parliament who is concerned about Ukraine sliding deeper into corruption and complained about doublespeak from current US officials I really think hell be straightforward They will demand real changes Unless he does that were doomedWishful thinking aside Ukrainian officials are looking to tamp anxiety about a Trump term Two years after the countrys Revolution of Dignity which toppled the Yanukovych government the country is looking to the United States as a counterweight to neighboring Russia and as a source of aid and impetus for change in UkraineThere are two premises as to why not all is lost First is that the president-elect was exaggerating speaking ad hoc when he made statements during the campaign that dont reflect his real foreign policyI am certain that his ego will drive him to show who is in charge Voytsitska said The rhetoric about Russia I believe it was just to be different from the usual In reality he will start to show the muscles of the great countryAnd second is that a deep bench of hawkish Republicans would nudge Trumps foreign policy toward Ukraine and away from Russia There is intense focus here on who will occupy key positions in the administration and questions about who will replace important players vis-a-vis Ukraine and Russia among them Vice President Biden and the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs Victoria Nuland She has been handling talks with Russia over the Minsk agreements as they are called which instituted an often-violated cease-fire in breakaway regions of Eastern UkraineRepublicans are more pro-Ukraine than Democrats said a high-ranking Ukrainian official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the president-elect candidly And of course the Republicans are going to influence their candidateUkrainian officials like the names that have been floated for secretary of state Sen Bob Corker (R-Tenn) is known here for demanding that the United States provide Ukraine with lethal aid (the Obama administration has delivered tens of millions of dollars in nonlethal aid but has not provided weapons or munitions) John Bolton a former diplomat and leading Republican hawk raises appreciative eyebrows Former New York mayor Rudolph W Giuliani is also viewed positivelyThe hometown favorite  before he said Thursday that he would not be taking a position in Trumps Cabinet  was Newt Gingrich The former House speaker traveled to Kiev in September to meet Poroshenko and spoke at the Yalta European Strategy conference where he told attendees that Trumps policies if he were elected might differ from his campaign statements according to  Trump shocked some people Sych said We thought it was Ukrainian tactics to first try and win the election campaign and then try to build your views and values because theres a lot of populists here Nobody thought that could be the case in the USUkrainian officials say their priorities now are to see US sanctions against Russia rolled over confirm the next tranche of US financial aid to Ukraine secure nonlethal assistance strengthen the military partnership between the two countries and also find a way to make a symbolic statement of allianceAlyona Getmanchuk director of the Institute of World Policy in Kiev said that officials were eager to establish good relations with Trump but were still testing channels of communication She was concerned that there will be less input from the West in terms of conducting reforms further reducing pressure on reluctant officialsOleksiy Melnyk the co-director for foreign relations and international security programs at the Kiev-based Razumkov Center said that Ukrainian officials were caught off-guard by the results of the election But he played down the potential now theoretical benefits of a Clinton victoryThe attempt to believe that the election of Hillary Clinton would be a solution to the Ukraine conflict was very naive he said The good news is that we wont be disappointed There were too many expectations for herHuman rights groups asked a federal judge Thursday to block President Trumps proposed ban on transgender people serving in the military producing statements by three former Obama administration US service branch chiefs and a senior Pentagon official that a ban would harm readiness staffing recruitment and moraleThe move to stop the Trump administration edict came two days after  to Trumps ordering the Pentagon chief to determine how to implement the policyIn a statement Shannon Minter legal director for one of two gay rights organizations representing eight transgender US service members said their opposition to the reckless ban was joined by military experts who know that ripping trained experienced service members out of our armed forces  for no reason other than who they are  will leave gaping holes in our defense compromise national security and inhibit recruitment during a critical timeThe groups said they sought an injunction now because even though Mattis has not taken action against current service members as the Pentagon reviews its options he committed to carrying out the Trump policy by March 23 As a result service members face the imminent prospect of being denied reenlistment promotions deployments and even medical care the groups saidMattis also suspended prior plans to permit new transgender enlistees threatening the careers of transgender students enrolled at the US Naval Academy or in the Reserve Officers Training Corps Minter said  The filing in the lawsuit by Minters group the National Center for Lesbian Rights and GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) came in federal court in the nations capitalJustice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said We are examining the claims in the motion and conferring within the GovernmentUS District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly could issue a ruling or set a hearing next week  Also Thursday the groups added two named individuals and one unnamed John Doe to five original plaintiffs identified by pseudonyms as Jane Does They include Regan Kibby a Naval Academy midshipman and Dylan Kohere an ROTC studentTheir participation at the academy and in ROTC is contingent on their eligibility to enlist in the military now in doubt they alleged Each said their initial decision to declare their transgender status was based on the Obama administrations decision to allow their service in 2016A big part of the reason I was comfortable coming out as transgender in the ROTC was the announcement in the summer of 2016 that transgender people would be able to serve openly in the military Kohere said in an affidavit    Kibby said he came out as transgender during his first year when the Obama announcement was made Kibby competed successfully for a congressional nomination and admission to the academy Kibbys enrollment was threatened in July when Trump caught many by surprise with tweets to countermand his predecessors actionAfter a lifetime of feeling a sense of duty and preparing to serve reading Trumps tweets was painful and I saw my future crumbling Kibby saidTrump on July 26 tweeted After consultation with my Generals and military experts please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the US MilitaryHe elaborated Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail  The armed forces were set to begin enlisting transgender people July 1 but Mattis suspended that moveOur focus must always be on what is best for the militarys combat effectiveness leading to victory on the battlefield Mattis said To that end I will establish a panel of experts serving within the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security to provide advice and recommendations on the implementation of the presidents directionBefore the Obama policy change the Pentagon had concluded that there was no basis for the military to exclude transgender people as long as they could meet the same fitness requirements as other service members The review examined medical care military readiness and other factorsThere is no official tally of transgender military members and estimates vary widely One recent study by the Rand Corp put the number on active duty at about 2500 while another from the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School estimated that there were 15500 on active duty in the National Guard and in the reservesIn affidavits filed Thursday Obama Pentagon appointees Ray Mabus Jr Navy secretary from 2009 to 2017 Eric Fanning who held a series of posts from 2013 to 2017 ending as Army secretary and Deborah Lee James Air Force secretary from 2013 to 2017 and Brad Carson acting undersecretary for personnel and readiness criticized the Trump proposalThe officials said the change would cause unexpected losses of skilled personnel in operational units that will be difficult to fill while reducing the size of the militarys recruiting poolPresident Trumps stated rationales for reversing the policy and banning military service by transgender people make no sense said Mabus who oversaw the Navy and Marines through the surge in Afghanistan They have no basis in fact and are refuted by the comprehensive analysis of relevant data and informationUS military officials said Thursday that they suspect Russian hackers infiltrated an unclassified Pentagon e-mail system used by employees of the Joint Chiefs of Staff the latest in a series of state-sponsored attacks on sensitive US government computer networksThe electronic intrusion was detected about July 25 officials said The Pentagon immediately disabled the e-mail system which is used by about 4000 military and civilian personnel in an attempt to contain the damage The network remains offline although officials said they hoped to restart it in the coming daysThe Defense Department disclosed the attack shortly after it occurred but only in recent days have investigators traced it to Russia Officials said the complexity and advanced nature of the hack strongly suggested that a foreign government was responsibleThis attack was fairly sophisticated and has the indications  of having come from a state actor such as Russia said a US official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the investigation The cyberattack on the Joint Staff which coordinates operations among the branches of the armed forces is similar to one last fall that successfully penetrated unclassified e-mail systems at the White House and the State Department  US officials said the trail also led to hackers thought to be working for the Russian government Even so officials cautioned that it is difficult to pinpoint the origin or perpetrator of such hacks Attribution in this business is near impossible Rarely are you ever able to say with 100 percent certainty who was behind a particular incident the official saidThe incident follows several other more destructive cyberattacks on US government networks including devastating breaches of databases maintained by the Office of Personnel Management US officials believe hackers working for the Chinese government were responsible for those which exposedResponding to the spate of attacks officials in Washington have said they were working to bolster the security of computer systems across the federal government The disclosure of a successful breach of a Pentagon e-mail network however is likely to generate new scrutiny from Congress on the reliability of Washingtons cyberdefensesUS officials said the hackers penetrated the Joint Staff network with an old-fashioned technique known as spear-phishing which relies on unsuspecting e-mail users clicking on links infected with malwareRussias intelligence agencies are also suspected of masterminding a successful attack on US military classified networks that was discovered in 2008 and took months to containThe Obama administration the Russian or Chinese governments for the recent cyberattacks or offer hard evidence of their involvement reasoning that to do so could inadvertently reveal details about US cyberdefenses Moreover the US government operates its own cyberespionage campaigns against other countries so publicly pointing the finger at other countries could be seen as hypocriticalIn the recent attack on the Pentagon officials said that only unclassified e-mails were exposed and that the damage did not appear to be significant They said the Joint Staffs classified networks were unaffected and are operating normallyWe continue to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks across our network and we continue to investigate this incident and our top priority is to restore services when we can said Navy Capt Jeff Davis a Pentagon spokesmanThere was no immediate reaction from Moscow  In April Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed reports that the Russian government was to blame for last years attack on the White House e-mail network It has become a kind of sport to blame everything on Russia he said at the timeWashingtons allies in NATO have reported similar attacks however and have traced some intrusions back to shadowy groups with suspected ties to Russian intelligence servicesIn May for instance a computer network for Germanys lower house of Parliament was penetrated in a major hack German news outlets reported that investigators thought that a Russian cyber-gang known as APT28 or Advanced Persistent Threat 28 was responsibleFireEye a US cybersecurity firm has scrutinized APT28 and suggested it has targeted government computers in Poland Hungary Ukraine and Georgia Julia Smirnova contributed to this reportEmployees of the scientific research arm at the Agriculture Department were ordered Monday to cease publication ofoutward facing documentsand news releasesraisingconcerns that the Trump administration was seeking to influencedistributionof their findingsDepartment officials scrambled to clarify the memo Tuesday afternoon after intense public scrutiny and media requests stating that the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) had not blacked out public information and adding that scientific articles published through professional peer-reviewed journals have not been bannedSuch a decree would have conflicted with established scientific integrity standards and previous media guidance encouraging but not requiring USDA scientists to communicate with the media about their scientific findingsThe memos shortness and terse language seems to have exacerbated the confusion Starting immediately and until further notice ARSwill not release any public-facing documents This includes but is not limited to news releases photos fact sheets news feeds and social media content wrote ARS chief Sharon Drumm in an email to employeesBy Tuesday evening the guidance had been rescinded in a subsequent email Yesterday we sent an email message about Agency informational products like news releases and social media contact another email to employees said This internal email was released prior to receiving official Departmental guidance and is hereby rescindedThe ARS guidance was not issued in coordination with other offices at the USDA department officials said and partially contradicted a department-wide memo that went out on the same day The USDA-wide memo issued by the departments acting deputy administrator Michael Young was intended to offer guidance on interim procedures until a new secretary takes over USDAYoung stressed during a phone call with reporters Tuesday evening that his guidance does not place a gag order on publication to scientific journals does not place a blanket freeze on press releases or prohibit food safety announcementsThe ARS guidance was not reviewed by me I would not have put that kind of guidance out My guidance has to do with policy-related announcement and that sort of thing Young said during a phone call with reporters early Tuesday evening I had my memo drafted before the ARS memo I was not a part of itYoungs memo a copy of which was given to The Washington Post emphasizes that press releases and policy statements must be routed through the office of the secretary for approval In order for the Department to deliver unified consistent messages its important for the Office of the Secretary to be consulted on media inquiries and proposed response to questions related to legislation budgets policy issues and regulations said the memo Policy-related statements should not be made to the press without notifying and consulting the Office of the Secretary That includes press releases and on and off the record conversationsYoung stressed that he is a career official not a partisan appointee and said that the memo he issued closely mirrored one sent at the beginning of the Obama administration He also said he shared the memo with Trump transition official Sam Clovis before issuing itThis is really just formalizing again what is fairly standard practice within the department I just felt like yeah I want to be cautious because I dont want any surprises on my watch I was trying to avoid any surprises he saidThe Agricultural Research Service employs thousands of in-house scientists maintains scores of research locations around the country and boasts a $1 billion budget It is tasked with conducting research to develop and transfer solutions to agricultural problems of high national priority according to the USDA That research focuses on topics such as food safety nutrition animal and crop production and agricultural sustainabilityResearch publicized on the USDAs website this month includes papers such as Helping Arizona Wheat Growers Maximize Resources and Test Uses Novel Antibodies to Detect Shiga ToxinsThe public-facing documents memo Monday which was first reported by BuzzFeed raised fears that the new Trump administration was attempting to filter articles about ongoing scientific research being conducted by ARSThe ARS sought to ease those concerns Tuesday afternoonYoung also said Tuesday evening that he had spoken with ARS and suggested he might support clarifying or rescinding the research agencys confusing guidanceAs the US Department of Agricultures chief scientific in-house research agency ARS values and is committed to maintaining the free flow of information between our scientists and the American public as we strive to find solutions to agricultural problems affecting America ARS said in a statement to The Post Tuesday afternoon seeking to clarify the scope of the memo  USDA and ARS have issued media guidance in the past Under the Obama administration guidance published in 2013 stipulated that USDA employees should clear any media inquiries on topics that are sensitive with public affairs staffers That media guidance which appeared to have been last updated in 2016 also urges them to communicate with supervisors about any instances where they feel public affairs or communications staff is stifling their ability to communicate about their workThe USDA does not yet have a permanent department head Former Georgia governor Sonny Perdue was nominated by President Trump to head the USDA last week but has not yet begun the confirmation process The congressional committee overseeing his hearing has not given guidance on when his hearing will take place pending his submission of necessary paperworkThe Republican Party of Virginia said Wednesday that Lt Gov Ralph Northam whose ancestors once owned slaves and fought in the Civil War had turned his back on his own familys heritage by calling for the removal of Confederate monuments The accusation drew swift condemnation from Democrats and some Republicans who said it amounted to calling Northam a race traitor In a two-part tweet on its official account posted shortly after noon the state party took aim at Northam the Democratic nominee for governor whose great-great-grandfather owned eight slaves in 1860 and nine slaves in 1850 on Virginias rural Eastern Shore @RalphNortham has turned his back on his own familys heritage in demanding monument removal (1/2) it read Shows @RalphNortham will do anything or say anything to try and be #VAGov - #Pathetic 2/2The blowback was instant  I feel fine about turning my back on white supremacy How does @EdWGillespie feel about the presidents position Northam tweeted in response referring to his rival in the November election former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie The Daily Beast ran a story under the headline Virginia GOP Calls Democratic Candidate a Race Traitor for Wanting Confederate Statues RemovedEven a conservative blog the Reagan Battalion jumped in asking the Virginia Republican Party Was your account hackedFormer delegate David Ramadan a Republican tweeted Have you lost your minds  who is in control of your twitter actAfter nearly four hours the state party pulled down the tweet and replaced it with this Our previous tweets were interpreted in a way we never intended We apologize and reiterate our denunciation of racism in all formsEric Boehlert a writer trolled the state Republican Party by tweeting Its almost like yr trying to erase history when you deleted the tweets#monumentsJohn Findlay executive director of the state GOP said the party was not suggesting that Northam should stand with his ancestors as slave holdersWe said that Ralph Northam is turning his back on his heritage and family It is because his great-grandfather fought for the side of the Confederacy and was wounded during the Civil War Findlay said When he wants to tear down monuments dedicated to those killed in action and wounded during the war he is literally talking about a member of his own familyFindlay noted a MassInc poll released Tuesday that found a slim majority of Virginia voters  51 percent  want the statues to remain on public property while 28 percent would like them removed A majority  52 percent  of voters polled also consider the monuments part of Southern heritage while just 25 percent believe the statues are symbols of racism  A substantial majority of Virginians believe these monuments are not about hate but about history and we likewise share that opinion Findlay saidNortham called for the removal of the states Confederate monuments after a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville on Aug 12 which had been called to protest the citys plan to remove a statue of Gen Robert E Lee from a downtown park One woman was killed by a car driven by a man whom police described as a white supremacist and two state troopers patrolling the protest by air died when their helicopter crashed Gillespie who like Northam notes that localities control the fate of their monuments has said that his preference is to keep the statues but to add historical context The RPV was right to apologize for the tweet and to take it down Gillespie spokesman David Abrams wrote in an email Though Ed disagrees with the Lieutenant Governor on the issue of statues he knows we can disagree on issues like this without devolving into divisive rhetoricThe party tweeted about Northam after tangling on Twitter for days with former congressman Tom Perriello who in June lost the Democratic primary to Northam Perriello who grew up in Charlottesville tweeted after the rally to denounce hate groups and President Trumps equivocating response to the violent events He also turned his fire on Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr after the prominent evangelical leader praised Trump for his bold truthful stmt about #charlottesville tragedy   The devil has his grip so firmly around @JerryFalwellJr that Im praying for his exorcism #Repent Perriello tweeted The former congressman also tweeted If you have a white pastor/priest who doesnt preach on white supremacy as blasphemy against image of God in another please say something And White evangelical leaders your whiteness is the golden calf you choose to worship and idolize in blasphemy of Gods word #RepentNowThe GOP replied to the last of those with @tomperriello Lets not mince words you are a Christian-hating bigot We were better off when you were out of the country #LeftWingBigotPerriello who served overseas in the State Department under President Barack Obama later said he was not accusing all white evangelical leaders of racism only those who do not preach that white supremacy is blasphemyIf they can produce a single Christian leader who agrees with their nonsense I am happy to sit down with them he told The Washington Post Otherwise they should delete these tweets that insult Christianity and stoke hateDemocrats were quick to defend Perriellos tweetsHow rich @VA_GOP attacks @tomperriello (observant Catholic) for speaking out against white supremacy Theyve been silent on Trump tweeted Kevin Donohue a spokesman for the Democratic Party of VirginiaThe presidents son and son-in-law have now testified to Congress about foreign

presidential election to help the elder Trump winOver the past year  regardless of intelligence reports that found Russians attempting to influence the US election  DonaldTrumps rhetoric has remained consistent He dismisses any allegation of Russian interference in the election as a hoax or fake news  often blaming the Democrats for making it all upThis video expanding on  explores the consistency

Director James B Comey about the same meetings and discussionsVirginias heated election cycle is becoming increasingly nasty with the statewide Democratic ticket sending out a new mailer linking Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie and President Trump to the torch-bearing white nationalists who descended on Charlottesville over the summerIn August violent clashes between white supremacists in Charlottesville rallying to defend a statue of Confederate General Robert E Lee and counterprotestors left one woman dead and two state troopers died when their The mailer features images of both Republican men above a photo of the white supremacists with the text On Tuesday November 7th Virginia Gets To Stand UpTo Hate   The back of the literature features a prominent image of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ralph Northam along with Democratic lieutenant governor nominee Justin Fairfax and Attorney General Mark Herring with the message This is our chance to stand up to Trump Gillespie and hate All three Democrats approved the ad and the Democratic Party of Virginia paid for the mailer But Gillespie has repeatedly condemned the white nationalists behind the Charlottesville protest President Trump blamed  for the violence and said there were very fine people on both sides Gillespie has said there was no moral equivalency between the white supremacists and counterprotesters and that he saw no fine people marching in Charlottesville but he stopped short of criticizing Trump as many Republicans and Democrats did Gillespies campaign condemned the mailer which was first reported by the Richmond Times-DispatchTo now see Ralph Northam and the Democratic ticket exploit imagery from that tragic weekend to try to score political points is both outrageous and beneath the dignity of the offices they seek Gillespie campaign manager Chris Leavitt said in a statement This is an ugly political attack that has no place in our Commonwealths political discourse Ralph Northam should be ashamed to have approved such a hateful mail pieceNortham campaign spokesman David Turner countered that the mailer was fair because Gillespie did not explicitly condemn the presidents response to the Charlottesville unrest Democrats pummeled Gillespie a former Republican National Committee chairman for not joining members of his own party including Virginia US Reps Barbara Comstock and Scott W Taylor in directly criticizing Trumps reaction   For 73 days Ed Gillespie has refused to call out Donald Trumps response to Charlottesville for what it was disheartening and wrong said Turner When the Charlottesville community wanted leadership to help them heal he failed Ed Gillespie should be willing to call out Donald Trump when hes wrong and because he wont he gives voters a clear choice on Nov 7Virginia politicians often pride themselves for the Virginia Way a concept that stresses civil discourse and setting aside partisan divide for the public good and for most of the campaign observers noted the genteel tone of the contest But in September Gillespie began airing ads that aimed to link  to Northam while using images of Latinos in a way Latino groups call racist and inflammatory And another ad suggests Northam wanted to restore gun rights to violent felons   Northam has also aired commercials blasting Gillespies record as lobbyist that claimed he lobbied for companies sending jobs overseas and companies trying to keep student loan rates high  claims  He seemed to lament the nasty tone of the campaign when speaking at a retirement community on Monday We have tried to be positive said Northam Virginians deserve civility especially after 2016Election Day is Nov 74chans /pol/ boards have for much of the 2016 campaign felt like an alternate reality one where a Donald Trump presidency was not only possible but inevitable At some point Tuesday evening the boards Trump-loving racistmemers began to realize that they wereactually rightIm f trembling out of excitement brahs one 4channer wrote Tuesday nightadding a very excited Pepe the Frog drawing We actually elected a meme as presidentThe first threads for collecting examples of genuinely upset libtards and Hillary Clinton supporters to meme mock and bombard them on Twitter began shortly after that On 4chan a night that even a lot of 4channers thought would be a meltdown turned in a celebration filled with schadenfreude Internet-savvy racism and frogs4chan has over the course of Trumps ascendancy to president-elect watched in delighted astonishment as its little fringe of Internet life made its way repeatedly into the mainstream conversation of the elections This is after all the decade-old Internet forum whose beloved Pepe meme caused   and a denunciationfrom the Clinton campaign  in September because of its new popularity amongwhite-supremacist Trump backers  The notorious message board has a long history of offending harassing or triggering its enemies  mainly but not exclusively liberals minorities and establishment Republicans  forits own amusement (ie lulz) The Trump movement was the perfectpathway for a wider audience of targetsThe 4chan vote was not the crucial voting block that swung the election to Trump but that sentiment the belief that 4chan had actually contributed to or straight up caused Trumps win was everywhere on the boards for most of the night Just hours earlier the boards were filled with much sadder Pepes and anxiety about thethen-positive results forClinton along with insults directed at the journalists who they knew expected to watch the there all day longAround 8 pm the chaos of ironic and genuine hand-wringing posts about /pol/ members and accusations of voter fraud began to slowly give way to images of FloridaFlorida was a must-win state for Trump everyone had said and /pol/ documented every fluctuation there Soon though panicked images of a blue Florida gave way to red ones One thread filled up with hundreds of Pepes to help meme Florida over to Trump as if their energy could help Florida stay redWE WON THAT one thread began as Floridas red shade held HOW DO YOU FEEL GUYS B- IS GOING TO JAIL in reference to Clinton Wrote another 4channer Holy s I just cant believe (((they))) are allowing this Thetriple parenthesis are a racist meant to signify that someone is JewishDisbelief soon gave way to impatience and conspiracy for some Neither of them have reported on Florida being won by Trump both are reporting Hillary is in the lead I feel theyre holding off waiting for the Dems to meddle with the votesAnother encouraged those in states where voters were still at the polls to Use EVERY weapon in our meme arsenal to turn Blacks & Hispanics away from Hillary The post re-upped a bunch of4chans vote by text hoax images and various other anti-Clinton memes WHATEVER IT TAKES (legally) TO MAGA Push like your life depends on it (it does) SHARE AND MAGABy about 945 4chan had noticed that the New York Timess real-time predictions on the elections outcome had suddenly started favoring Trump after starting off the day heavily favoring Clinton The board became a typically chaotic mess of celebrations threads urging meme magic for other swing states  particularly Michigan Pennsylvania and Virginia  and speculation about the Trump presidency that as the hours ticked on became all but certainI should be sleeping work tomorrow will be tough but the morning will be a glorious one one post readsThey discussed which mainstream or liberal news coverage was the best to watch for potential journalist freak-outs as Clintons path to victory disappeared (The consensus was The Young Turks although one 4channer speculated that if any mainstream journalists had handguns theyd be offing themselves right there on live tv) Brexiters joined in the celebrations and one 4channer rewrote a popular post from the boards celebration of Britains referendum to leave the European Union to be about TrumpFinally by about 2 am the anxiety had disappeared from the boards as the calls handing Trump the presidency began to roll in By 230 a moderator had stickied this video to the top of the boardsAnd /pol/ reflected on how it good it felt to them to be rightToWhite House Chief of Staff John F Kelly the conversation between the president of the United States and the spouse of a fallen soldier is sacred And perhaps privateBut President Trump has been on the receiving end of significant criticism after Rep Frederica S Wilson (D-Fla) said hetold a pregnant widow thather husband who was killed in an ambush in Niger knew what he signed up for Trump denies he said those words which the lawmaker called insensitive to Myeshia JohnsonKelly said Thursday during the White House news briefing that he was shocked that Wilson was even a part of the conversationIt stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation he said Thursday in the White House briefing room It stuns me I thought at least that was sacred  Wilson being present for a conversation between the commander in chief and one of her grieving constituents doesnt make the call not sacred Neither does the fact that the mother of the fallen soldier  who confirmed Wilsons report  was present as wellPerhaps Kelly who also listened to the call would be less stunned if he realized that Wilsons primary identity to the Johnson family isnt as a member of Congress The Johnsons have known Wilson for decades  most of those years before the former educator moved to Washington to join CongressWhen I saw the headline that a young man was killed in Niger from Carol City I thought My God please dont let it be a role model Wilson told Politico And it wasThe deceased soldier was an alumnus ofthe5000 Role Models of Excellence Project a mentoring program Wilson started for youths pursuing military careers among other fields So were his brothers One received a full scholarship to Bethune-Cookman University and the other is training to become a firefighterWilsons connection to the family goes back at least one generation She CNN that she was the principal of a school that Johnsons father attendedThese relationships werepart of why Wilson was with the family  not just because she was a member of CongressThe Washington Posts Derek Hawkins about thisWilson was consoling his wife Myeshia Johnson when by her account Trump called and said that La David Johnson knew what he signed up for but when it happens it hurts The president

those who come out of her program news archives showKelly explained in great detail how the military notifiesthe families of those who have lost a loved one on the battlefield Heseemed to bedescribing a situation similar towhat he went through himself whenheshared with The Post in 2011 what it was like to get the news that his own son had died at war Heres what  thenKelly would struggle to describe the pain he felt that day on his front porch It was disorienting almost debilitating he wrote in an email At the same time my mind went through in detail every memory and image I had of Robert from the delivery room to the voice mail hed left a few days before he died It was as graphic as if I was watching a videoIt really did seem like hours but was little more than a second or soKelly composed himself and moved down his front steps to speak with Dunfords wife and walk his friends into the house [Gen Joseph F Dunford Jr a close friend had come toinform Kelly of his sons death] His wife Karen was still asleep I then did the most difficult thing Ive done in my life Kelly said I walked upstairs woke Karen to the news and broke her heartKelly repeatedly stated during the briefing that those who have never had to endure what his family or the Johnson family have endured could never understand the pain they went throughBut for some Americans family is a broader concept that goes beyond the nuclear family often elevated in traditional circlesNo one would argue that Kelly is not qualified to talk about grieving a loved one But he also cant know who is privy to the Johnsons grief andwho was in their inner circle in one of their saddest and most sacred momentsOn Thursday afternoon Anne T Donahue was partway through reading a   about decades of sexual harassment claims against Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein  when she couldnt contain her outrage any longerI felt what I think most women especially have felt  that exhausted defeated feeling of when someone abuses power Donahue told The Washington Post So I did what I do best when Im angry I went on TwitterThere she recounted in a pair of quick tweets her first experience with what she called her own Harvey

radio station experience At first she tried to reply to everyone While the sheer volume of tweets quickly became unmanageable Donahue said she has been responding to all those who opened up about sexual harassment in private messages with herIts an overwhelming feeling but in a way you feel in awe of everyone whos chosen to talk men and women It affects everybody It hurts everybody she said I didnt think this was going to be a campaign It was mostly me shouting into the abyssand voices came backSince the Times report broke Thursday Weinstein has said he would take an indefinite leave of absence from the Weinstein Company which he co-founded One-third of the companys all-male board quit and its remaining members said they were investigating the sexual harassment allegations against

kelly oxford (@kellyoxford) What followed Oxford was more than a million women sharing their stories at her She estimated she was receiving 50 stories per minute at one point and called them harrowingOn Saturday Donahue said she had remembered the #NotOkay tweets from a year ago but said they werent why she had tweeted what she did Though she said her first experience with sexual harassment came before she was 17 reading about the Weinstein allegations brought to mind her very specific encounters with the shoulder-rubbing boss because they reflected the same power imbalanceIt felt targeted she said He was a man in power who used power to make me feel powerless but would dangle the carrot of professional achievement in my faceDonahue said she felt lucky When she reported her bosss behavior people believed her Not everyone is she said in a guest column for the Toronto Globe and MailRape culture is everywhere It permeates our politics our entertainment our walks to school our job interviews our families our social circles We ask victims of harassment and assault what they were wearing before asking the perpetrator why they did it We ask how much someones had to drink why they didnt quit toxic jobs or report creepy teachers or why they didnt rearrange their lives to escape the pattern they managed to get themselves intoWe remind the masses that boys will be boys or worse that real boys and men arent victims of harassment abuse and assault themselves pressured into silence at the hands of toxic masculinity that uses dangerous sexual norms to measure ones worth Rape culture doesnt discriminate It thrives on what we decide is normal reminding anyone whos suffered at the hands of it that they did something wrongDonahue said shehopes those who have experienced workplace sexual harassment feel less alone when reading through the replies to her original tweet as well as others that have sprung up under #MyHarveyWeinsteinIt can feel very isolating when somethings happening to you she said I just lit the match Its everyone who responded who added to the fireJACKSON HOLE Wyo  Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet L Yellen offered a forceful defense of broad new banking regulations enacted after the 2008 financial crisis saying the rules safeguard the economy against another crisis and rejecting assertions from President Trump and top aides that they should be rolled backYellens speech delivered here to an annual gathering of central bankers finance ministers and economists comes as Trump considers whether to reappoint her to a four-year term as head of the US central bankYellen 71 made clear in her speech on Friday that she believes tighter regulations and standards have made the banking system safer and that while some improvements could be made they should be modest not structuralThe evidence shows that reforms since the crisis have made the financial system substantially safer Yellen said according to prepared remarks  Trump has waffled on whether he would renominate Yellen to the post She was first nominated by President Barack Obama for the four-year term after having served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Trump has said he likes her cautious approach to raising interest rates but declaring her opposition to rolling back new banking rules could put a wide chasm between her and the White HouseThere are numerous banking regulators that have input in how the financial system is overseen but none are as powerful or as influential as the head of the FedYellens speech comes just hours after the Financial Times published an interview with Gary Cohn Trumps top economic adviser in which he openly criticized the way Trump handled violence carried out by neo Nazis and white supremacists in CharlottesvilleCohn was also considered a front-runner for the Fed chairman post and the separate decisions by Cohn and Yellen to distance themselves from Trump could mean that neither is interested in cozying up to him as a way to try to get the nominationYellens speech reflected on the governments response to the Great RecessionA financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 caused a global panic with some of the worlds largest financial companies wobbling or toppling and the US government injecting hundreds of billions of dollars into the financial system to prevent a collapse Large financial companies were interconnected and had amassed large amounts of risk without cushions to absorb losses or access to cash to prevent bank runsBanks and financial companies were chasing profits by making loans to people who lacked the ability to repay at times falsifying documents and betting on the false premise that the housing market would continue to soar As the banking system began to falter consumers panicked the stock market crashed hundreds of thousands of Americans lost their jobs and the US and many other economies went into recessionsIn 2008 the Bush administration and Congress passed a law that allowed the government to inject money into the banking system to try to arrest the crisis In 2010 the Obama administration and Congress passed a law that imposed new consumer protection rules required banks to hold bigger cushions against losses put new limits on their ability to take risk tried to establish a process to help wind down large financial companiesTrump has said these changes went too far calling the law a disaster that has made it hard for consumers and businesses to access credit and restricted economic growth One of his arguments supported by many banks is that requiring banks to hold more capital to cushion against losses makes it harder for them to lend moneyYellen addressed these criticisms head-on in her speech saying that research is mixed but that Fed officials believe there were sizable net benefits to economic growth from higher capital standardsShe acknowledged though that some borrowers could see a decrease in access to loans because of the new rulesWhile material adverse effects of capital regulation on broad measures of lending are not readily apparent credit may be less available to some borrowers especially home buyers with less-than-perfect credit histories and perhaps small businesses she saidShe added that the Fed one of the nations bank regulators is taking steps to ease regulatory complexity that small banks face to help more small businesses obtain loansYellen did not say in her speech whether she was interested in being appointed to another term She also didnt comment specifically on Trump or any conversations she has had with himThis may sound like Federal Reserve fan fiction if such a thing exists but the best thing Fed Chair Janet L Yellen could do right now might be to say that shell stay on  even ifPresident Trump doesnt reappoint herShe could actually do thatFed chairs have the option to serve out a 10-year term as a Fed governor if they arent picked to lead the Fed again It has just never come up the past 40 years since theyve always been reappointed as long as theyre doing a good job and want to keep doing it Indeed President Ronald Reagan kept Jimmy Carter-nominee Paul Volcker President Bill Clinton kept Reagan-nominee Alan Greenspan and President Barack Obama kept George W Bush-nominee Benjamin S Bernanke Trump though really might not choose Yellen despite the fact that the unemployment rate is at a 16-year low and inflation is under its 2 percent target You like to make your own mark he  Fox Businesss Lou Dobbs which is one of maybe the things shes got a little against her So is the fact that he seems to want someone who would take a lighter regulatory touch to Wall StreetNot all deregulators are created equal though Jay Powell the current Fed governor who is reportedly the  might not be  as tough on the big banks as Yellen would be considering his finance background but its not as though he would gut the post-crisis rules Not when he voted for them himself And just as important he has supported all of Yellens interest-rate decisions over the past few years Powell then would be the change candidate for the status quoBut the other finalist Stanford economist John Taylor would be another matter entirelyIts not just thathe would probably ease up on Wall Streetgiven that he thinks the government was  for a lot of the bad decisions banks made in the run-up to the crisis  a position that as Bloomberg Newss  points out is  borne out by the evidence Its also thathe has consistently called for higher interest rates to fight inflation that isnt there and has never admitted their mistakes Insteadhe has concocted ever-more-elaborate theories  easy money causes  and is just about  big government  about whyhe was right to be wrongOf course its possible that Taylorwould change his tight-money tune now that a Republican is in the White House In fact his supporters seem to be counting on that albeit put a little more politely (The Wall Street Journal Editorial Page the unofficial organ of supply-side thought  that Taylor wouldnt choke off a tax cut-fueled boom because he believes that faster economic growth without inflation is possible and necessary)But you know its possible that they wouldnt  in which case it would make a lot of sense for Yellen to stay at the Fed as a governorYellen wouldnt get to decide  the Fed voted on anymore but she would still have a lot of influence on  the Fed voted Thats because she has a lot of sway with the remaining members This admittedly is where we enter the realm of central banking fantasy Since 1993 Fed governors have dissented only  from what the Fed has decided Even when they might harbor some private doubts they tend to be very deferential to the Fed chair But if someone like Taylor was appointed and Yellen did stay we could end up with a situation where there were three Fed governors  Yellen Powell and Lael Brainard  deeply at odds with a Fed chair who wanted to raise rates much more than they did Add in New York Fed President Bill Dudley and San Francisco Fed President John Williams both of whom have generally agreed with Yellen and will be voting members next year and they might even have a majority Itd be enough to make say Fed Chair John Taylor either compromise quite a bit or else see himself become Fed chair in name onlyThis would be radical but these are radical times Dont let the 42 percent unemployment rate fool you For the past 30 years it has taken lower and lower interest rates just to produce lower and lower growth Putting someone who doesnt understand that in charge of the Fed risks leaving millions of people worse off than they should be After all the low-unemployment economy that Yellen has helped to happen is finally giving working-class families their  after accounting for inflation since the end of the Clinton administrationThats worth fighting for even if central bankers dont usually fight this wayA new national poll from Suffolk University suggests that not much has changed in the race over the last week or so It has Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by about seven points slightly over the Buried deep in the poll though is a remarkable bit of data On  we learn that 7 percent of Trump voters think he is a racistThats a relatively low figure mind you compared to the views of most other demographic groups Overall 44 percent of repondents said that yes in their view the Republican nominee for president was racist compared to 47 percent who said no Democrats and black voters were most likely to say that he was (76 percent and 83 percent respectively) suggesting that Trumps recent overtures to the latter group (to the extent that ) havent exactly solved his problem Six in 10 Hispanics said they thought Trump was racist with a third disagreeing which is I guess good newsBut there at the end that awkward 7 percentWeve seen similar results before Last week a  asked people a slightly different question Did they think that Trumps rhetoric appealed to bigotry Most didAs I wrote at the timeEven worse for Trump a plurality of every demographic save Republicans felt that he appealed to bigotry including majorities of independents men women whites with or without college degrees people aged 64 or younger and both whites and nonwhites Among all whites 54 percent felt that Trump appeals to bigotry (with 50 percent of white men agreeing) Among nonwhites the figure was 72 percent (With 29 percent of Republicans saying they think he appeals to bigotry and 84 percent supporting him that means that at least 13 percent of Republicans both think he appeals to bigotry and plan to give him their vote)Presumably Suffolks 7 percent of Trump backers who think he is racist fit into that 13 percentIf we broaden the question even more as The Post did in its August poll with ABC News  We asked if people thought Trump was biased against women or minorities and 60 percent of Americans said that he was Whats more a fifth of Republican men and a quarter of Republican women said he was to some degreeWeve pointed out repeatedly that this is almost certainly a problem for Trump as he tries to solidify support from moderate Republicans and independents Thats true but now we can definitively say that viewing Trump as racist is not necessarily an insurmountable problem for voters That 7 percent must  dislike Hillary ClintonOr maybe they you know dont really have a problem with racismAfter a Christmastime lunch in 2010 then-British Parliament member Mark Garnier handed his secretary cash and took her to a sex shop in the west end of London He told her that he wanted her to go inside and purchase two vibrators one for his wife and another for a woman in his constituency officeThen Caroline EdmondsonGarnierstood outside the shop while she completed the purchaseAnother time at a bar in front of other people he told her You are going nowhere Sugar T---Edmondsons claims about the employer she quit working for in 2010 spread acrossBritain and then the world on Sunday  part of a growing avalanche of sexual harassment accusations made against male British politicians by female colleaguesFaced with a growing crisis Britains cabinet office has launched an investigation to determine whether Garnier broke conduct rules  Prime Minister Theresa May is scrambling to show the public that Britains political leaders are assisting female colleagues who have silently endured sexual harassment  sometimes in offices down the hall or around the cornerFor his part Garnier who was first elected to Parliament in 2010 and appointed to Mays cabinet last year acknowledged that the claims were true but dismissed his actionsasharmless hijinksIm not going to deny it because Im not going to be dishonest he said according to the AP Im going to have to take it on the chinThe statement about his former secretarys breasts was a reference to a popular BBC show he said adding that his conduct could be taken as dinosaur behavior butabsolutely does not constitute harassment  The accusations come as women across the world have shared stories about being groped harassed or even assaulted    For those who have come forward and many many others the stories from London were an eye-rolling recognition that creepy guys exist in all careers across all socioeconomic strata and even in the hallowed seat of British democracyThe stories have different characters but similar themes men in positions of power and women who feel their institutions didnt do enough to protect themIn London the accusations are ensnaring politicians at the highest levels of governmentStephen Crabb a married member of Parliament whom one newspaper once deemed admitted that he sent explicit text messages to a 19-year-old woman after her 2013 job interview according toEnvironment Secretary  after he said that being interviewed by BBC broadcaster John Humphrys was like going into Harvey Weinsteins bedroomLondon media have circled around reports of a WhatsApp group by aides and researchers to warn female colleagues about members of Parliament who frequently grope staff in taxis or events where alcohol is servedAccording to  one minister was branded Not Safe In lifts because of his behavior Another was described as handsy One message said a member of Parliament needs a new researcher  cant be a womanMays official spokeswoman said Any reports of sexual harassment were deeply concerning and that is true in any walk of life including politics She suggested however May will not pass judgment until theinvestigative process is completed  On the other side of the political spectrum Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn said systems need to be put in place to better protect female colleagues from harassing bossesThe prime minister has announced this morning that she supports which I agree with her on a process that the staff of any [member of Parliament] of any party can and should report these matters to the House of Commons authority he said Where there is an unequal power relationship in the workplace and women become vulnerable as a result of it they have to be supported they have to be protectedClaims of similar misconduct have been reported by women who used to work for the US CongressAs  Rep Jackie Speier (D-Calif) has urged former and current staffers to use the #MeTooCongress hashtag to share their stories of sexual harassmentThousands of #MeToo social media posts spread after the accusations about Weinstein Lee reported sparking dialogue about the pervasiveness of sexual harassmentSpeiersaid that when she was a congressional staffer a chief of staff for then-Rep Leo Ryan (D-Calif) held her face and forcibly kissed herI know what its like to keep these things hidden deep down inside I know what its like to lie awake at night wondering if I was the one who had done something wrong Speier said adding that Congresss rules for dealing with harassing behavior is antagonistic to victimsIt is not a victim-friendly process It is an institution-protection processSpeier recently told The Post I think we would find that sexual harassment is rampant in the institution But no one wants to know because theyd have to do something about itWhat was supposed to be a morning of personal triumph for Debbie Wasserman Schultz  rallying her home-state delegation before opening the Democratic National Convention she had orchestrated  suddenly became one of humiliationShame people in the room jeered as the congresswoman addressed a Monday breakfast of the Florida delegation ShameIt was a cringe-worthy nationally televised spectacle that exposed deep divisions within the Democratic Party and reopened raw wounds from the Hillary Clinton-Bernie Sanders primary battles By the afternoon Wasserman Schultz had disappeared here in Philadelphia after also giving up her speaking slot and her ceremonial role gaveling the convention to orderOn Sunday Wasserman Schultz had announced plans to resign as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee effective Friday after leaked emails among her and her top aides revealed favoritism for Clinton during the presidential primariesThe partys turmoil drove conversation in Philadelphias sweltering streets Monday with elected officials and delegates agitated and alarmed that it was overshadowing the conventions kickoff The four-day production had been carefully choreographed to be a week-long celebration of unity behind Clinton about to become the first woman to be a major partys presidential nomineeIts like a blister it just popped It had been festering and festering and festering John Morgan a Florida-based Clinton donor said of Wasserman Schultzs rocky tenure which he has long criticizedDonna Brazile the incoming interim party chair acknowledged the rowdy atmosphereIt takes time to heal time to come together she said in a brief interview backstage at the Wells Fargo Center Im confident that we can find common ground which is whats most importantBrazile said she has been apologizing to Sanderss advisers and to disgruntled party donors Ive told them that we will make sure our system gets better make sure our practices get better and make sure our email gets more secure she said Ive been in this party for 40 years We love this party and were going to do what needs to be doneBut Wasserman Schultzs departure from center stage was not enough to quell the partys tumult The DNC has begun an investigation of internal emails following the compromise of its network by hackers and party officials braced for thousands more potentially embarrassing messages to surface in the coming days or weeks  There is also uncertainty about how long Brazile might stay on as chair She said she is willing to serve through the November election but does not want the position permanently and discussions are underway about who might step in nextMany senior Democrats said additional firings may be necessaryClintons campaign manager Robby Mook said the DNC should take appropriate action based on the findings of its review Other Democrats were more directDown the road staffers are going to have to be part of the consequence part of the casualties said Rep Ral M Grijalva (Ariz) co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and a Sanders supporter Its one thing to take away the titular head but its also appropriate to address those who were navigating and writing these emailsVirginia Gov Terry McAuliffe a former DNC chair said he was outraged If I had been chair they would have been fired within five minutes McAuliffe said although he expressed sympathy for Wasserman Schultz noting that he had a drink with her Sunday nightThe Sanders contingent felt vindicated having long seen Wasserman Schultz as a Clinton agent masquerading as an impartial referee Even as the senator from Vermont urged his followers to unify behind Clinton they displayed remarkable dissent all afternoon and the convention was awash in anti-Clinton and anti-trade chantsThis controversy aggravates all of the fears and suspicions that millions of Americans who supported Bernie Sanders had during the Democratic primaries and caucuses said Robert Reich a Sanders backer who was secretary of labor in Bill Clintons administrationVeteran party figures said it is understandable that Sanders and his followers would not trust the DNC considering Sanders has largely worked outside of the party structure running as an independent in VermontI can see their claiming foul but maybe they should have early on had some overture and closeness to the DNC by having people connected there over the years said William M Daley a former White House chief of staff to President Obama Because he never ran as a Democrat there was no connection whereas the Clintons for the last 25 years have had hundreds of people on the DNC staffing the DNC fundraising for the DNCClinton allies were hopeful Monday that after four nights of speeches the tensions over Wasserman Schultz and her DNC staff would be forgottenWho endorses whom when where and why whos the chair of the DNC  it really doesnt matter House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) told reporters at a Bloomberg Politics eventOne Democrat close to the Clintons who requested anonymity to speak candidly said of the Wasserman Schultz episode I think this is much of a tempest in a teapot but its the heat of politics and the teapot is whistlingComplicating the party establishments push to bind together their ranks Monday were fuming donors who while mostly aligned with Clinton and the DNC felt themselves dragged into a spotlight they did not seek Many were upset that their exchanges with party leaders were leaked  and by the way staffers belittled and mocked them in private correspondenceThe emails exposed a DNC culture that at times some Democrats said was built around sustaining Wasserman Schultzs image and national standing more than the health of the party at largeIt was all about her first second and third Morgan said You had a very partisan person who had many different agendas but none of them was whats in the best interest of party and all of them were whats in her best interest Thats the dysfunction in a thumbnailThe DNC leadership sought to move on issuing a public apology to SandersThese comments do not reflect the values of the DNC or our steadfast commitment to neutrality during the nominating process the statement read The DNC does not  and will not  tolerate disrespectful language exhibited toward our candidates Individual staffers have also rightfully apologized for their comments and the DNC is taking appropriate action to ensure it never happens againIn Wasserman Schultzs absence Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake a DNC vice chairwoman gaveled in the convention Monday afternoon and was named secretary of the conventionThough she remained out of the public eye most of the day Wasserman Schultz kept parts of her political schedule Hilary Rosen a strategist and friend of Wasserman Schultz said the party chairwoman attended a restaurant gathering hosted by donor Stephen Bittel where she grew emotional as she thanked him and other friendsRosen said Wasserman Schultz planned to stay in Philadelphia throughout the convention disputing chatter that she might fly home to FloridaThe congresswoman told the Sun Sentinel newspaper in Florida she had decided that in the interest of making sure that we can start the Democratic convention on a high note that I am not going to gavel in the conventionEarlier in the morning the Florida delegation breakfast devolved into chaos with Sanders supporters berating her Wasserman Schultz tried to quiet the crowdIf I could ask everybody to settle down she said Moments later she repeated herself All right everybody now settle down Settle down pleaseThey did not The boos and jeers and cries of shame continued until Wasserman Schultz exited It was the last time many people saw the party chairwoman Jenna Portnoy contributed to this reportSecretary of DefenseJim Mattis the former general who has spoken at the head of Marine formations ready for battlehas found a new audience for his blunt wisdom budding high school journalistsTeddy Fischer a student at Mercer Island High School in Washington state  who has granted few interviews since he was tapped to lead the Pentagon for President Trumps administrationKnown as a warrior monk for his expansive reading lists Mattis dissected topics from over-politicization of US discourse to navigating combat operations in Syria with Russia and Iran in the frayHe wasted no time to discuss history after Fischer asked where students should focus their energyHistory will show you not all the answers but itll tell you a lot of the questions to ask and furthermore it will show you how other people have dealt successfully or unsuccessfully with similar type issues Mattis told the school paper the IslanderReaping lessons from the past will probably play a part in the Defense Departments  where the longtime strategy to shift security responsibility to local Afghan forces while reducing NATOs footprint appears to have falteredWe are not winning in Afghanistan  June 13 We will correct that he said to lawmakers frustrated with signs that Mattiss new way forward could resemble past surges of US troopsWe cant keep going like this Sen John McCain (R-Ariz) told Mattis at the hearing You cant expect a stable budget if you dont give us a strategy  Fischer tracked down Mattis after The Washington Post and to Fischers surprise Mattis returned the callMattis who speaks frankly in his public appearances does not often grant interviews to defense journalists looking to better understand his battle-worn approach to the worldBut he did offer to Fischer an optimistic mission for the nations youths to affect the world in whatever path they chooseGo out of your way Not everyone has to join the military its not for everyone Mattis saidFor one thing its scary as all get out at times but whether it be the Peace Corps or the Marine Corps  just try to put others first and it will pay back in so many ways that youd be a lot happier in lifeFischer later keyed on the White Houses sometimes tumultuous balance of military might and diplomacy as the administration with Mattis on point takes on issues such asand Vladimir Putins What you have to do is make certain that your foreign policy is led by the diplomats not by the military Mattis told himI meet for breakfast once a week with Secretary of State [Rex] Tillerson and Ill advise him on the military factors for his foreign policy but I do not believe that military issues should lead in foreign policy I think thats where diplomats lead and the military then reinforces the diplomatsOne nexus of diplomacy and military power that Mattis appears to be talking about  Qatar  was the subject of policy contradictions last month with  to gulf states to end blockades with the country housing a US airfieldkey to operations against the Islamic StateFischer apparently still indisbelief during the interview that Mattis picked up the phone asked the former general with the call sign Chaos why he decided to speak with ahigh school student near Seattle while the to-do list for the Pentagon chief grows every dayMattis said healso grew up in Washington state on the other side of the CascadesIve always tried to help students because I think we owe it to you young folks to pass on what we learned going down the road so that you can make your own mistakes not the same ones we made Mattis saidThe worlds most powerful royal

first used in the 14th century and comes from the Middle English word doten meaning to dote It was inThe Canterbury Tales and appeared numerous times in William Shakespeares work including The Taming of the Shrew and King LearIn the book  dotard is linked to French  which means to repeat things several times because one forgetsJRR Tolkien was also fond ofdotard which was a popular pejorative in literature  and beyond The word was usedto one of Trumps White House heroes andby to describe his Civil War predecessor Gen Winfield Scott whom he did not likeA front-page story in the July 25 1854

which might explain how the arcane word wound up back in the news dotard is a translation of a Korean word neukdari which is a derogatory reference to an old personSometimes it is translated into the neutral old people or omitted depending on the context or the importance of the statement KCNA last used the word in February to describe supporters of ousted South Korean President Park Geun-hye whom it also called neukdari and a prostitute Before that KCNA called Parks conservative predecessor Lee Myung-bak the traitor like a dotardSo why did KCNA use the word againIt may have simply resorted to a Korean-English dictionary Putting neukdari into a popular online Korean-English dictionary in South Korea returns two English equivalents an aged (old) person and a dotard  Its worth noting that

#dotard (meaning an old senile person) That figures Liberals hate usHe added an American flag emoji to his tweetThe video was humiliating and racist and it had spread to other students at the speed of the Internet So the black teenager who was called racial slurs while he ate chicken tookmatters into his own hands with violent resultsIt was early October a few weeks after the start of classes at Saucon Valley High School 75 miles north of Philadelphia The 16-year-old student was at a pep rally participating in a chicken wing eating contest his attorney saidNearby a white student a 14-year-old underclassman pulled out his phone and started filmingHe titled the video His welfare check canceled and provided narration according to So theres a chicken wing eating contest here This fnis taking his time Hes getting free fchicken you n It has been a minute and hes on the same fwing Oh now the black kid is taking the wings back up to his seat What what are you that brokeThe white teenager goes on to make remarks about the black student being on welfare He talks about his African features and his love of KFCThen he Snapchatted the videoto his friends And they shared it with their friends By the end of the pep rally the video had made its way to its subjectThe severity of what happened next depends on whos telling the story  District Attorney John Morganelli described it as apushing match and the black student kind of got the better of the other student He declined to release either teens name because they are minors The black teens attorney Gary Asteak said the nurse sent the 14-year-old home with three bumps on the headBut the 14-year-olds attorney described a brutal confrontationAs offensive as the video was physically assaulting someone is worse Michael Moyer told the Morning Call In school In the middle of the day With teachers standing aroundThe boys father seeing his injuries called police according to the DAs officeThe black teen whom Morganelli described as a high-achieving honor student was charged with simple assault disorderly conduct and harassmentThe 14-year-old on the other hand was suspended from school but not chargedThe case elevated racial tensions in Northampton County where 88 percent of residents are white and 64 percent identify as black Many thought it unfair that the white student who filmed and spread the video escaped legal consequences while the black teen faced a judgeAmong the critics was Asteak who told The Washington Post that his client reached a breaking point after the school didnt punish previous episodes of racist bullyingThe question is not whether the 14-year-old deserved a whupping for what he said but whether the authorities were sensitive to the fact that he also committed an offense Asteak saidHis client had been called the n-word walking down the hall Hes been taunted This group that calls themselves the rednecks threw a Confederate flag over his shoulder and mocked him he said  When the authorities are blind to this kind of behavior its like a cancer that continues to grow without treatment he saidAsteak even questioned whether President-elect Donald Trumps comments on the campaign trail played a role The subject of political correctness became a talking point he said It suddenly became okay to do this kind of thingAsteak approached District Attorney Morganelli in court one dayHe was here on another matter and he asked if Im aware of the case Morganelli said Im the elected DA I dont usually see juvenile court stuff all that often  but when I saw [the video] I thought Jesus this is really bad I inquired about why there werent charges brought against the white maleOn Dec 8 he announced that he was opening an investigation of the case to see whether the white teen should be charged with a hate crime On Tuesday he announced that the boy would be charged with cyber-harassment and ethnic intimidationHe told The Post that hes pushing for both students to be put into diversion programs that would expunge their records if they complete the terms of their probationThe result is more fair given the circumstances Morganelli said although he said the announcement about charges against the white teen has brought out a different set of criticsI did get a lot of phone calls from I guess Id call them kooks he said Apparently this stuff gets circulated on some crazy websites I got a phone message here that said Morganelli you hate white people Youre an n-word loverAs a presidential candidate Trump called into question his countrys long-standing commitments in the region anddemonized China as a nation somehowdefrauding the global economy While he has toned down some of his campaign bluster on Asian affairs particularly his anti-Chinese broadsides there is still plenty of tension to defuseTrump has or TPPa free-trade deal with a host of countriesin the Asia-Pacific region and lobbed rhetorical missiles at North Korea that have raised the specter of war on the peninsula His bellicosity has  and even at times The fear of the region on Jan 20 was Trump would disengage from Asia said Michael Auslin an expert on East Asia and a fellow at the Hoover Institution during a recent panel at the Center for the National Interest a Washington think tank Now Auslin suggests the worry isreally about an administration in policydisarrayNext months trip thus presents a significant opportunity for Trump to clear up his messaging explain his administrations Asian agenda and  particularly in the face of an ever-assertive ChinaWe need a successful trip to Asia said Harry Kazianis the Center for the National Interests director of defense studies at the panel The president needs to go to Asia and really ensure despite leaving TPP that we are really behind our alliesAs  the president is expected to skip the East Asia Summit in mid-November aides fear extending the trip that longmay make Trump cranky and prompt unpredictable or undiplomatic behavior The event was scheduled when it was inpart to enable Trumps participationIt is a big deal The Obama administration made a point of investing in these regional institutions in order to demonstrate we are an Asia Pacific power a resident power in the regionThis will only raise more questions about American credibilitysaid Derek Mitchell a former US ambassador to Burma to Rogin Multilateralism in Asia is often just about showing up but even that appears to be hard for himTrump and some of his in-house ideologues  Their focus will be on bilateral meetingswith the leaders of the countries he visits He is slated to deliver a speech at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam that will reaffirm the US commitment to a free and open Asia Pacific an administration official Hovering in the background will be a host of complex geopolitical questions How tough a line will Trump take on Chinese expansionism in the South China Sea To what extent can Trump translate his personal bonhomie with Chinese President Xi Jinping into political results How will he get along with his two most important East Asian allies A liberal dovish president in Seoulandan increasingly hawkish prime minister in TokyoThe pariah states nuclear threat will loom over most of Trumps deliberations with Asian leaders The president has repeatedly rattled his saber at Pyongyang promising fire and fury and addressing North Korean despot Kim Jong Un as Rocket Man Earlier this month Trump contradicted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson then on a visit to Beijing by suggesting negotiations with North Korea arent worthwhile at allAny military option  whether targeted strikes on North Korean military facilities a broader intervention or even an attempt on Kims life  would as Kazianis put it open the ultimate Pandoras box Analysts fear retaliation byNorth Korea would potentially lead to millions of deaths in the region not to mention the prospect of an intercontinental ballistic missile launch aimed at American territory even if itprefigured the regimes downfallThe Trump administration certainly understands this but you wouldnt get that impression from Trumps own rhetoricSome of the chaos in Washington obviously does not lend itself to successful foreign policy strategies or outcomes Kazianis saidMost countries in the region believe the only solution lies in bringing North Korea to the table probably through diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions a strategy similar to the Obama-era doctrine of strategic patience Yet even as the Trump White House has blasted that approach its remarkably similar to the policies TrumpIronically Auslin notes for all of Trumps contempt for his predecessor his policy regarding North Koreaseems to be an Obama plus strategy Posturing with shows of force while pushing for sanctions and calling for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula Given Pyongyangs growing stockpile of nuclear weaponsAuslin argues I think strategic patience is likely the best choiceThe channels that existed even at the height of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States to help mitigate against a calamitous mistake arent there between Washington and PyongyangWhat I think has changed the most Auslin said is not the threat of war but the threat of accident Auslin suggests the United States needs to work with allies and countries like China and Russia to answer what may seem a crazy question How do we help the North Koreans maintain a safe and secure nuclear arsenalOn one side impassioned Prince William County residents dressed in green shirts argued that constructing a new house of worshipwould disrupt their quiet community choke the roads with traffic and go against the zoning regulations meant to protect the rural enclaveOn the other side their Muslim neighbors said that all they wanted was a place to pray in their own community  and that opposition to their plans to construct a mosque might arise out of not just technical arguments about land use but also bias against IslamAfter hours of heated testimony on Tuesday night whichincluded 170 speakers and went past 3 am the Prince William Board of County Supervisors voted to approve the mosqueWe were kind of biting our nails and all that But in the end I feel like I could go another 10 hours Mohammed Iqbal a member of the Muslim congregation All Dulles Area Muslim Society (ADAMS) said exultantly as he walked out of the meeting in the wee hours of the morningWe love USA we love Prince William we love Gainesville And now we feel like we got what we deserve Iqbal said As a citizen this is a proud moment Its really a proud moment for all of us We migrated to this country with the notion that this is the best place in the world and we find out this is the best place in the worldIqbal and the others celebrating the workings of local bureaucracy early Wednesday morning at the county government center in Woodbridge are members of ADAMS one of the nations largest mosques The mosque already has permanent locations in Chantilly Fairfax and Sterling rents space from a synagogue in Ashburn and holds worship services inhotels in Arlington Manassas and Vienna among other locations according to its websiteADAMS bought a piece of land in Nokesville in Prince William County for $500000 in 2014 to build its next facility But the property is in the area of the county known as the Rural Crescent  a protected zone where single-family homes must sit on lots of at least 10 acres most residents must use septic tanks many raise livestock and facilities like a religious institution require a special-use permit from the county supervisors ADAMS sought a special-use permit The residents who lined up to tell the county supervisors why they supported or opposed the mosque on Tuesday night beginning shortly after 730 pm and talking one after the next for more than sevenhours  tended to focus on preserving the Rural Crescent Even middle schooler Mateolined up to say Im only in seventhgrade but I cannot imagine all the traffic in our rural community with much smaller roadsA good neighbor is one who upon entering a new neighborhood respects the rights of the existing neighbors does not try to bully its way into special exceptions and who is not attempting to affect change that will negatively impact the character of the neighborhood for its existing residents said Vickie Wilson a resident of the area where the mosque will be built who testified in opposition to it along with her husband Jeff Wilsonthe senior pastor at Bethel Evangelical Lutheran Church in ManassasJeff Wilson said that he respects the desire of fellow people of faith for a house of worship near their homes But the issue at hand he said was also a question about preserving the Rural Crescent upholding the laws of zoning or the covenant agreement with the people of the Rural CrescentOther religious leaders spoke out in favor of the mosque What I dont understand is how exactly the mosque would destroy that sense of peace and that sense of something greater than ones self in a rural area said Sister Joanna Burley a nun in the Benedictine Sisters of Virginia I question the concern about trafficWhen one speaker Bill Cook of Haymarket began his testimony by mentioning terrorism and Hamas and then alleging that many mosques in the United States are owned by an affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood dozens of people watching his testimony from the overflow seats in the lobby startedbooingThe county supervisors eventually approved the special-use permit for the mosque as well as an exemption to let the mosque use a public sewer not a septic tankCorey Stewart the chair of the board of supervisors was instrumental in delivering the eventual 5-3 vote in favor of the sewer accessStewart has long made himself known for his forceful opposition to illegal immigration and during his recent bid forthe Republican nomination for governor of Virginia which he narrowly lost he ranin the inflammatory model of President Trumpand spent much of his time defending Virginias Confederate statuesBut he also spoke frequently about the need for Virginia Republicans to get to know minority communities and he has long had relationships in Prince Williams growing Muslim community His embrace of Trump  whose campaign he worked for  disturbed some of those Muslim constituentsCorey Stewart made some unfortunate remarks during his most recent campaign said Nathan Mowery a member of ADAMS However he has demonstrated over his years being on the Board of County Supervisorsthat he is a friend and ally to the Muslim communityhere He understands that we are patriotic Americansstriving to improve our community Hes made that clear to usEarly Wednesday morning Stewart was on their sideA raid by government forces in Bahrain against a pro-opposition stronghold has left at least five people dead and hundreds detained in one of the deadliest crackdowns since protests erupted in 2011 against the Persian Gulf nations Western-backed monarchyBahrains Interior Ministry said it carried out the raid Tuesday in the village of Duraz It said officers came under attack including from assailants armed with explosives Opposition activists said that the police targeted a peaceful sit-in outside the home of and that the dead included an environmental activistProtests and clashes have flared for years in the tiny but strategic island nation between the Sunni-led monarchy and Bahrains majority Shiite population which has complained of discrimination and other abuses Bahrain hosts the US Navys 5th FleetThe timing of the raid was striking coming two days after President Trump that their relationship would be free of the kind of strain that had occurred in the past  an apparent reference to the Obama administrations periodic chiding of Bahrain over its human rights violationsOur countries have a wonderful relationship together but there has been a little strain but there wont be strain with this administration Trump said during a photo session with the king Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa at a conference in Riyadh Saudi ArabiaTrumps attendance at the Riyadh conference was largely aimed at winning back Persian Gulf allies that had bristled at President Barack Obamas outreach to Shiite power IranTrumps widely anticipated speech ostensibly about Islam and extremism included assurances to the gulfs Sunni states that our friends will never question our supportIn Bahrain the governments opponents viewed the conference and Trumps appearance with the Bahraini monarch as providing tacit approval for the raid on TuesdayThe killing of five protesters is a heinous crime enabled by the unconditional support of the Bahraini rulers key allies in Riyadh Washington and London Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei director of advocacy at the said in a statement Wednesday This bloodshed  the blood thats on their hands  will only continue unless it is met with severe consequences from the international community he said   In Washington the State Department said that it is troubled by the clashes and urged restraint on all sides We urge the government of Bahrain to ensure those arrested are provided with access to counsel and that legal proceedings are conducted with transparency in accordance with due process spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement Bahrains Ministry of Information Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for moredetails on the circumstances that led to the deaths or about the evolving US relationship with Bahrain A government statement released Wednesday said protesters refused an order to disperse and injured security personnel It said the deaths were being investigated by the public prosecutorMembers of Bahrains Shiite majority have long protested what they say is widespread discrimination at the hands of the Sunni dynasty ruling the countryPolitical life and sectarian relations have steadily deteriorated since the government with help from Persian Gulf allies quashed a Shiite-led pro-democracy uprising in 2011 Since then have been imprisoned fled the country or are facing prosecutionOfficials in Bahrain have accused Iran of inciting unrest and violent attacks against Bahrains security agentsAfter the raid Irans foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif denounced Bahrain and the United States for the raid He wrote that it was the first concrete result of POTUS cozying up to despots in Riyadh Deadly attack on peaceful protesters by emboldened Bahrain regime Google itPresident Trump on Thursday appeared to rule out sending the New York terrorism suspect to the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay Cuba after threatening a day earlierto send the alleged attacker to the detention centerBacking off his initial statement that he was considering detaining the suspectat Americas most notorious prison Trump said Thursday that Sayfullo Saipov instead  through the civilian justice system which historically has been delivered faster convictions than the military tribunal system  Trump tweeted Would love to send the NYC terrorist to Guantanamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the Federal system  There is also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed Should move fast DEATH PENALTYWould love to send the NYC terrorist to Guantanamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the Federal system Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) There is also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed Should move fast DEATH PENALTY Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) On Wednesday Trump said he felt the US criminal justice system was a joke because it took too long for accused terrorists  these animals he called them  to be prosecuted convicted and sentencedWe need quick justice and we need strong justice much quicker and much stronger than we have right now Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting at the White House Because what we have right now is a joke and its a laughingstock  When a reporter asked whether he would send Saipov to the Guantanamo Bay prison Trump replied I would certainly consider that Send him to Gitmo I would certainly consider that yesA few hours later White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanderssaid the presidents unscripted remarkshould not have been interpreted asa statement of intention or policyLook the point he was making is that he supports or would support that but he wasnt necessarily advocating for it Sanders saidSanders said the Trump administration considers Saipov to be an enemy combatant but stressed that no decision had been made about how to prosecute him or where he would be detainedMetro transit police have arrested a 29-year-old man in connection with sexual battery and public masturbation after he allegedly targeteda woman in a train in JuneThe woman was able to identify the suspect because she had allegedly been victimized by the man a year and a half earlier  one of at least two dozen instances in which he has been arrested in connection with indecent exposure Metro said in a newsrelease FridayThe suspectNathaniel Tyrone Ford of Southeast DC was arrested Friday in the Districtand will be extradited to Fairfax County to be charged in courtHis arrest is in connection with an incident that occurred in a train at West Falls Church station on June 5 during which Ford is accused of committing public masturbation and sexual battery  a misdemeanor offense under Virginia law that is defined when someone sexually abuses the complaining witness by force threat intimidation or ruseAccording to Metro Ford has previously been arrested more than two dozen times in connection with indecent exposure both on and off public transit including theJanuary 2016 incidentfrom which the woman was able to identify him He was arrested in that case as wellHe has also been cited 11 times in connection with fare evasion Ford is listed in the Districts sex offender registry and was convicted last January of lewd indecent or obscene acts against a 17-year-oldMetro spokesman Dan Stessel said transit agency officials are not aware that he has served prison time forthat conviction or any others  In their statement Metro officials pointed out that they do not have the ability to ban people from using the system  even after a person is suspected of having committed so many acts of wrongdoingCurrently the only way to keep an individual off Metro is through a court-issued stay-away orderMetro saidIt will be up to a judge in Fairfax County to determine whether to ban Ford from riding Metro trains and buses in the immediate or long-term future but Metro officials have raised concerns in the past that judges often issue stay-away orders that only bar suspects from the specific route line or station where a crime allegedly occurredStessel said Friday that the transit agency is not aware of any previous instances in which Ford received a full stay-away order for the entire Metro system but he has been ordered to stay away from particular lines or stations in the past  orders that only lasted until his next scheduled court date In this upcoming case Stessel saidMetro transit police will request that prosecutors seek a stay-away order for the full systemAfter a 38-year-old woman was charged with simple assault last week in connection with the throwing of a cup of urine at the face of a Metrobus driver Metro transit police requested that she be barred from the entire system But the prosecutorsin that case requested that the woman stay off just the X2 bus where the incident happened Ajudge granted that request and the suspect Opal L Brown continues to be allowed to ride the rest of Metros buses and trainsCorey Stewart declared the kinder gentler Republican extinct Thursday as he announced his plan to launch a vicious campaign to unseat Sen Tim Kaine (D-Va) in 2018 with all the bombast that brought the Prince William supervisor within a hair of winning his partys nomination for governor last monthIm going to run the most vicious ruthless campaign to dethrone Tim Kaine from the United States Senate said Stewart not quite a month after losing the gubernatorial nomination to Ed Gillespie by 12 percentage points Its time that Republicans take back that seat its time that we have a senator who supports the president Not trying to obstruct his wayThe move pits Stewart a President Trump supporter who celebrates the Confederacy and slams illegal immigrants against Hillary Clintons former running mate in a state that often embodies the nations political crosscurrentsStewart who has boasted that he was Trump before Trump was Trump said Democrats partly blame Kaine for losing the presidential race and called him a nervous NellieKaine dismissed the criticism but in a subtle barb announced just ahead of Stewarts news conference that he and Sen Mark R Warner (D-Va) had secured $42 million in federal funding to preserve Civil War-era battlefieldsRight out of the gate Corey Stewart is more focused on name-calling than improving Virginians lives Kaine campaign adviser Jenny Nadicksbernd said in a statement Senator Kaine will continue working with both Democrats and Republicans to build economic opportunity through better skills jobs and wages and protect health care for all VirginiansStewarts announcement was met with silence from state GOP leaders and elected officials who said they are focused on making sure Gillespie is the first Republican elected in November to statewide office since 2009But some Republicans said a Stewart candidacy threatens to damage the GOP brand and derail Gillespies efforts to appeal to moderate Republicans and independents especially those in vote-rich northern VirginiaCorey Stewart will be out there saying and doing ridiculous things that make the party look bad and put Republican candidates in a terrible position said Bill Bolling a former two-term Republican lieutenant governor This is really a nightmare for the Republican PartyFrom the front yard of his Woodbridge home Stewart announced his campaign with his smiling wife by his side but without any other elected officialsHe said he was launching his campaign a year in advance to start raising money for what could be an expensive race Stewart who struggled for funds in his gubernatorial bid and was outspent 3-to-1 by Gillespie embraced  strategy to garner media attention and inflame voter passion He gave away an assault rifle at a shooting range unfurled Confederate flags at rallies and got into a Twitter war with musician John Legend among other things  Asked whether he would need support and resources from state and national party officials Stewart was defiant He said he had not consulted with anyone before deciding to run on the heels of his strong showing in the Republican gubernatorial primary electionTheyre less important than they used to be thats for darn sure he said The party is going to have start waking up and realizing that constituents conservative Republicans are looking for a more aggressive populist candidate Im talking about someone who can actually appeal to people to average working-class people and bring them inStewart acknowledged that Kaine helped Clinton win Virginia  the only Southern state she carried But he later said that Democrats arent that enthralled with the senatorRepublicans have said running nationwide with Clinton forced Kaine to take positions  opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership as well as offshore drilling  that are out of step with Virginia votersYet polls show Kaine  a former governor and lieutenant governor  is popular in the state with a 58 percent job approval rating while Trumps approval ratings were at 36percent in a Washington Post-Schar School poll in MayGeoffrey Skelley a political analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics said the statewide landscape favors KaineIn an alternate universe where Clinton won people like Barbara Comstock or Dave Brat would probably be looking much harder at running for Senate in 2018 he said referring to Republican members of Congress from Virginia But given that Trump won and is very unpopular in the state of Virginia my guess is Tim Kaine is very happy to face Corey StewartStewart nearly won a primary despite a serious resource shortage so that might suggest that a primary is better for him Skelley said But the dynamics of the 2018 GOP candidate field will matter a great dealJohn Whitbeck chairman of the Virginia GOP said he anticipates a crowded fieldHes not going to be the only candidate so were not even worried about that right now because we have a tremendous challenge ahead of us to win three statewide races Whitbeck said referring to the November election when Virginia voters will choose a governor lieutenant governor and attorney generalStewart is the first Republican to announce his intention to challenge to Kaine Carly Fiorina the former GOP presidential candidate conservative radio host Laura Ingraham and retiring state Del Jimmie Massie III (Henrico) have said they are considering joining the race The party will decide its nominee in a primary election next yearIn hypothetical matchups Kaine would defeat Fiorina by 24 points and Ingraham by 21points according to an April Quinnipiac University pollIn an interview with The Washington Post last month Stewart offered a glimpse of how he might conduct himself with Kaine through some blunt advice for Gillespie in his contest against Democratic Lt Gov Ralph NorthamEd if youre listening to this Nobody cares that your dad owned a grocery store Stewart said mocking Gillespie for a boring stump speech line geared toward blue-collar voters and a Mr Rogers sweater Gillespie wore in a campaign ad Sometimes you just gotta be yourself Just do itStewarts strong showing in last months gubernatorial primary shocked state party leaders and political observers who had dismissed him as a fringe candidateThe native Minnesotans embrace of Southern heritage issues and disdain for the Republican establishment drew support from white nationalists and many Trump voters in the western part of the state as well as southwest and Southside Virginia and his own Prince William CountyStewart served as Trumps Virginia campaign chairman for much of last year until he became too divisive even for the Trump campaign and was firedDespite some of his inflammatory rhetoric about immigrants Stewart has navigated the changing demographics of his county with some successHe recently regained favor with local Muslims upset about his support for Trump when he championed the building of a new mosque in Gainesville  a project that tapped into anti-Muslim sentiments before it  last month in a 5-4 voteBut Stewarts insurgent gubernatorial campaign did cost him some support  four of the five Republican supervisors who serve with Stewart came out for Gillespie abandoning plans to stay neutralHave North Koreas nuclear tests become so big that they have altered the geological structure of the land Some analysts now see signs that Mount Mantap the 7200-foot-high peak under which North Korea detonates its nuclear bombs is suffering from tired mountain syndromeThe mountain visibly shifted during the last nuclear test an enormous detonation that was recorded as a 63-magnitude earthquake in North Koreas northeast Since then the area which is not known for natural seismic activity has had three more quakesWhat we are seeing from North Korea looks like some kind of stress in the ground said Paul G Richards a seismologist at Columbia Universitys Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory In that part of the world there were stresses in the ground but the explosions have shaken them upChinese scientists already have warned that further nuclear tests could cause the mountain to collapse and release the radiation from the blastNorth Korea has conducted six nuclear tests since 2006 all of them in tunnels burrowed deep under Mount Mantap at a site known as the  Intelligence analysts and experts alike use satellite imagery to keep close track of movement at the three entrances to the tunnels for signals that a test might be comingAfter the latest nuclear test on Sept3 Kim Jong Uns regime claimed that it had set off a hydrogen bomb and that it had been a perfect successThe regime is known for brazen exaggeration but analysts and many government officials said the size of the earthquake that the test generated suggested that North Korea had detonated a thermonuclear device at least 17 times the size of the US bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945It registered as an artificial  so big that it shook houses in northeastern China Eight minutes later there was a 41-magnitude earthquake that appeared to be a tunnel collapsing at the site  Images captured by Airbus a space technology company that makes Earth-observation satellites showed the mountain  An 85-acre area on the peak of Mount Mantap visibly subsided during the explosion an indication of both the size of the blast and the weakness of the mountain Since that day there have been three much smaller quakes at the site in the 2- to 3-magnitude range each of them prompting fears that North Korea had conducted another nuclear test that perhaps had gone wrong But they all turned out to be naturalThat has analysts Frank V Pabian and Jack Liu wondering if Mount Mantap is suffering from tired mountain syndrome a diagnosis previously applied to the Soviet Unions atomic test sitesThe underground detonation of nuclear explosions considerably alters the properties of the rock mass Vitaly V Adushkin and William Leith  on the Soviet tests for the United States Geological Survey in 2001 This leads to fracturing and rocks breaking as well as changes along tectonic faultsEarthquakes also occurred at the United States nuclear test site in Nevada after detonations thereThe experience we had from the Nevada test site and decades of monitoring the Soviet Unions major test sites in Kazakhstan showed that after a very large nuclear explosion several other significant things can happen said Richards the seismologist This included cavities collapsing hours or even months later he said  Pabian and Liu said that the North Korean test site also seemed to be sufferingBased on the severity of the initial blast the post-test tremors and the extent of observable surface disturbances we have to assume that there must have been substantial damage to the existing tunnel network under Mount Mantap they  for the specialist North Korea website 38 NorthBut the degradation of the mountain does not necessarily mean that it would be abandoned as a test site  just as the United States did not abandon the Nevada test site after earthquakes there they said Instead the United States kept using the site until a nuclear test moratorium took effect in 1992For that reason analysts will continue to keep a close eye on the Punggye-ri site to see if North Korea starts excavating there again  a sign of possible preparations for another testThe previous tests took place through the north portal to the underground tunnels but even if those tunnels had collapsed North Koreas nuclear scientists might still use tunnel complexes linked to the south and west portals said Pabian and LiuChinese scientists have warned that another test under the mountain could lead to an environmental disaster If the whole mountain caved in on itself radiation could escape and drift across the region said Wang Naiyan former chairman of the China Nuclear Society and a senior researcher on Chinas nuclear weapons programWe call it taking the roof off If the mountain collapses and the hole is exposed it will let out many bad things Wang  last month  The recent seismic events have triggered another environmental concern at least on the Internet that the nuclear tests might trigger the eruption of Mount Paektu an active volcano straddling the border between North Korea and China more than 80miles away The mountain has not experienced a major eruption for centuries and its last small rumble was in 1903But this scenario experts say is a stretchVolcanic eruptions happen when molten rock flows into the magma chamber under the surface said Colin Wilson professor of volcanology at Victoria University of Wellington in New ZealandIf an earthquake occurs when the magma is hot and as Wilson puts it ready to roll it could trigger an eruption But if the molten rock is not activated then even a large earthquake wont cause a volcanic eruptionHe cited the Tohoku earthquake in 2011 which had a magnitude of 9 but did not cause any of Japans many volcanoes to blow their topTheres no point in kicking a dead horse Wilson said If the horse is up and ready and you give it a slap on the bum it will take off But if its dead even if you slap it its not going anywhereAlec Baldwin pulled double duty on Saturday Night Live this weekend Not only was he  but he also debuted a Bill OReilly impression  while interviewing himself as TrumpThe result SNL got to teasetwo of its favorite foils at the same time  using only one actorThe (not entirely seamless) sketch focused on OReillys buddingproblem of sexual harassment allegations which Trump this week dismissed by saying In the sketch even Baldwin-as-OReilly is incredulous that the president decided to weigh in his defense at a time when  Asked about how much he actually knows about the case Baldwin-as-Trump demursIm more familiar with this case than say health care but I really didnt look into it much no he said I was busy being super presidential by bombing a bunch of s---Self-proclaimed white nationalist Richard Spencer led a large group of demonstrators carrying torches and chanting You will not replace us Saturday in Charlottesville protesting plans to remove a Confederate monument that has played an outsize role in this years race for Virginia governorWhat brings us together is that we are white we are a people we will not be replaced Spencer said at an afternoon protest the first of two rallies he led in the town where he once attended the University of VirginiaAt the second rally  in a city park Saturday evening and chanted You will not replace us and Russia is our friend local television footage shows Spencer was not shown addressing that gathering but he tweeted a photo of himself standing in the crowd carrying what appeared to be a bamboo tiki torchThe evening protest was short-lived About 10 minutes in an altercation between Spencers group and counterprotesters drew police to the scene and the crowd quickly dispersed the Charlottesville Daily Progress reportedOnce an obscure Internet figure promoting white identity Spencer coined the term alt-right  referring to a small far-right movement that seeks a whites-only state  and rose to prominence during Donald Trumps presidential campaign Although Trump denounced the alt-right Spencers followers counted his victory as a win for the movement as Trump espoused hard-right stances on undocumented immigrants Muslims and political correctness  You will not replace us You will not destroy us Spencer said at the earlier rally which he broadcast via  You cannot destroy us We have awoken We are here We are never going awaySpencer was in Charlottesville to protest a City Council vote to remove a statue of Confederate Gen Robert E Lee A court injunction has halted the removal for six monthsThe statue has become a rallying cry for Corey Stewart a Republican gubernatorial candidate Stewart who is chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors was chairman of Trumps Virginia campaign until he was firedThere was no indication that Stewart who has alienated some supporters with his focus on Confederate symbols attended either rally In defending the Confederate battle flag and monuments Stewart has said he is not promoting symbols of hate but battling political correctness and historical vandalismStewart did not respond to a request for comment Sunday He kept a relatively low profile on TwitterI want to wish all the mothers a very special Mothers Day today he said in one of his few tweets of the day  The rallies drew condemnation from the other four contenders for governor former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie state Sen Frank W Wagner (R-Virginia Beach) and Lt Gov Ralph Northam and former congressman Tom Perriello both DemocratsAll are vying to succeed term-limited Gov Terry McAuliffe (D)The ugly display of divisive rhetoric and intimidation tactics in Charlottesville yesterday  does not reflect the thoughtfulness and tolerance I see in my fellow Virginians everywhere I go Gillespie tweetedWagner who faces Stewart and Gillespie in the June 13 GOP primary said via email These actions are totally unacceptable These people are racists They dont represent Virginia values I condemn their actions and beliefs I call on all Virginians who are involved in efforts to advocate for or against Virginias history to act responsibly and honorably Said Northam There is no place for hate fear or intimidation in Virginia The display in Charlottesville is the last gasp of a disgusting ideology In this commonwealth our doors are open our lights are on and we are welcome to everyone who shares a love for it no matter who you are or where youre fromPerriello who grew up in Charlottesville tweeted derisively at Spencer after the alt-right leader posted video of the first protestGet your white supremacist hate out of my hometown Perriello wrote on TwitterSpencer replied We won you lost little TommyActually you lost Perriello shot back In 1865 150 years later youre still not over itIn a country where cinemas are banned and even Starbucks are segregated by gender a powerful young prince is pushing a plan to create jobs for women and a more integrated and satisfying social life for a youthful population long straitjacketed by oppressive cultural norms The expansive effort aims to overhaul and diversify Saudi Arabias oil-dependent economy and modernize a restless culture in which women make up just 22percent of the workforce and nearly two-thirds of the population is under 30That means most Saudis have never lived in a society that places much value on fun and entertainment  the kind of world they see when they travel abroad And thats a world they seem to crave Saudis spend more than $5billion a year on overseas leisure travelWe want to be normal like anywhere else said Nouf al-Osaimi 29 a scuba diving instructor who was gearing up for a dive at Dream Beach a few miles north of this Red Sea port Osaimi hopes to open her own dive school and thinks the governments goals will make that easier for her and other female entrepreneurs The world is moving forward and we need to keep upThe Vision2030 plan the most dramatic and far-reaching set of changes for the Saudi economy and society in decades is being driven by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman King Salmans  has emerged as a remarkably influential leader since his father took the crown two years ago Mohammed met with President Trump at the White House in March and the two are expected to see each other again when Trump visits the kingdom this weekend  Unlike many high-profile members of the royal family the prince was educated in Saudi Arabia not at elite universities in the West which young people here said gives his demands even more credibilityWe are the same generation and we speak the same language said Fatimah al-Sani 29 a woman who works at Uturn Entertainment a Jiddah company that produces YouTube videos and is planning to expand under Vision2030In this country of 32million people the main entertainment options are shopping malls cafes and restaurants that are still largely segregated While men and women have been allowed to mingle more freely in public in recent years there are relatively few museums or other venues for them to do thatPrince Mohammed has said that people will be more productive workers if they are happier in their leisure timeWe have a lot of weekends in the year so we need options said Amr al-Madani a top official of the General Entertainment Authority which was created under Vision2030 to license arrange and sometimes finance cultural events People work hard and they need to reenergizeSince November Madani said his group has supported more than 100 events in 21 cities including art and food festivals the Arab Worlds first YouTube Fanfest a Comic-Con convention and a US-style monster jam with huge trucks with big wheels in a Riyadh soccer stadium filled by more than 25000 people It has even sponsored a handful of live music concerts which have generally been bannedMore conservative members of Saudi society have complained that the prince is moving too fast Madani noted that part of his job is to persuade people who are intimidated by what they fear will be an onslaught of Western-style entertainment with R-rated content He said the authority is being careful to support only events that are family-friendly and reflect Saudi valuesAlthough change comes slowly in this conservative kingdom analysts here said Prince Mohammed clearly has the support of his 81-year-old father and the backing of much of the business community which hopes to recapture some of the billions that Saudis spend vacationing overseasIts logic and common sense said Soraqa al-Khatib an executive at Uturn the online entertainment firm in Jiddah If we can create the right environment here I can tap into thatOne evening last week Maha 30 waited in line with her sister Ranya 28 and nearly 200 other people to attend a show at Al Comedy Club in Jiddah the only stand-up comedy venue in the countryMaha and Ranya said they spent thousands of dollars last fall to fly to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates to see a concert by the singer YanniI would rather spend my money here but there is nothing to do said Maha a government payroll worker If we are just working all the time whats the point We need things to doThey declined to give their last names because they did not tell their father they had gone to Abu Dhabi for the concert Under Saudi law women may not travel internationally without the permission of a male guardian Their father had given them general permission but they worried he would revoke it if he found out they had traveled without telling him  Yaser Bakr 38 said he started Al Comedy Club in 2012 and now hosts two shows every Thursday evening in the 185-seat theater He said he initially had to request permits from local government officials who had difficulty even understanding the concept of someone standing on stage and making jokes It was like literally Chinese to them Bakr said dealing with the General Entertainment Authority has been much easierHe said his comedians poke fun at Saudi society but they go easy on religious and political topics and avoid profane or explicit content All of his comics are male and the audience is segregated by gender with wooden partitions The audience is also sober because alcohol is banned in Saudi ArabiaMy prediction is that all the segregation will go away in a couple of years Bakr said crediting Prince Mohammed with driving that change including the calls for increasing female participation in the workforce to 30percent and encouraging more women to start businessesWe have never before had someone who was not the king with this kind of clear power Bakr saidAbrar Qari 23 the first Saudi woman with a government license to run a video production studio said the new atmosphere in the country toward women  and the promise of more business-friendly regulations and easier access to capital  has given her a chance to expand her company which produces educational and cultural videosI can hire other women and help them do the same  and more she saidQari spoke one day recently as she strapped a dive vest and air tank over her wet suit and flippered into the Red Sea with an underwater camera in her hand She was filming a documentary about Nouf al-Osaimi her female dive instructor who holds Saudi deep-dive recordsI feel like I am building bridges for the next generation Qari said And its all happening because of the VisionThe Vision is talked about everywhere in Saudi Arabia these days  touted on billboards on television commercials in newspaper advertisements and on social media Prince Mohammed spoke about it in a nationally televised interview this month He said in that interview that the country had also vastly increased its annual non-oil revenue in the past two years from about $30billion to $53billion from mining and other businessesAt the same time the government faced with budget deficits from  has made unpopular cuts to government salaries and benefits subsidies for gasoline and water and other generous benefits Saudis have long taken for granted The plan also calls for a new value-added tax on goods and selling off a chunk of Saudi Arabias crown jewel the state-owned oil behemoth Those economic measures have led to backlash most notably in the kingdoms hyperactive social-media world But the princes social plans seem to have broad supportFor almost a quarter-century Ahmed al-Ghamdi 54 was a member of the Saudi religious police tasked with enforcing the kingdoms strict cultural norms  including patrolling malls to make sure unrelated men and women werent mixing breaking up gatherings with music enforcing shop closings at prayer timeThen Ghamdi had a change of heart He left the religious police and now embraces the ideas he sees Prince Mohammed pushing In many ways he said those societal changes trace their roots to the Sept11 2001 attacks in the United States in which 15 of the 19 attackers were Saudis He said there was such international backlash against the kingdom including from other Muslim countries that we started thinking about our own religious beliefsThe result Ghamdi said was a widespread view that Saudi society needs to modernizeThere is a youthful spirit in our country and a push for change  things will not stay the same he saidThat rings true in the Jiddah offices of Uturn where women  some in hijabs some with their hair uncovered  and men work on laptops in a shared office space filled with glass walls and ping-pong and foosball tables The company has about 80 YouTube channels and employs about 40 people producing everything from comedy to shows on beauty  and it plans to expandThis is exciting life-changing and empowering said Zoya Shahid 24 a Uturn employee who wears a hijabEmad Eskander 34 Uturns creative director said the company is careful to follow Saudi cultural norms But still he said the religious police used to come to their

nations Friday to immediately ease their blockade of Qatar and urged all involved in the week-long Persian Gulf dispute to quickly resolve their differences remarks that President Trump seemed to undercut less than an hour laterTrump began a Rose Garden news conference with the visiting president of Romania by saying that the Saudi-led action against Qatar was hard but necessary He said he had been consulted in advance by nations that spoke to me about confronting Qatar a country he said historically has been a funder of terrorism at a very high levelHe said he had decided along with Tillerson and our great generals and military people the time had come to call on Qatar to end that funding  and its extremist ideologyEarlier in a brief formal statement at the State Department Tillerson had called on Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Bahrain and Egypt to ease their blockade warning that it was causing humanitarian hardship in Qatar harming US and international business and hindering US military actions against the Islamic StateA senior administration official speaking after Trumps comments acknowledged a difference in tone with Tillerson But I think the policy is consistent said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to explain the apparent discrepancyTrump does not oppose easing the blockade  although he did not mention it  but he does believe that [Qatar] deserves it the official said If the Persian Gulf states and Egypt want to keep the pressure on in terms of canceling flights with Qatar and pulling ambassadors  [Trump] is okay with thatTillerson may initially have had a view then the president has his view and obviously the presidents view prevails the official said He said that the two had spoken immediately before Tillersons State Department remarks which the secretary read over the telephone to the president Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis also met with Trump on Thursday at the White HouseThe fast-escalating crisis in the Persian Gulf began Monday when Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Bahrain and Egypt severed relations with Qatar expelled its diplomats and nationals and closed ports airspace and borders to the small energy-rich nation surrounded on three sides by the Persian Gulf Its only land border is with Saudi ArabiaTrump in a series of Monday postings on Twitter quickly congratulated the Saudis and claimed credit for encouraging the move He said that while he was meeting with Arab leaders in Saudi Arabia last month and calling for them to unify against extremism they had pointed at Qatar as a terrorism funderAlthough Trump delivered a speech to dozens of leaders of Muslim-majority countries called to Riyadh for the occasion the focus of the visit was the bilateral relationship with Saudi Arabia with which the administration said it had concluded more than half a trillion dollars of military sales and commercial deals and US defense coordination with the Gulf Cooperation Council the six-member regional body that includes the Saudis the UAE Bahrain Qatar Kuwait and OmanThe group has always been less than cohesive with the Saudis claiming leadership and Qatar challenging its dominance and differing on issues such as forming a working relationship with Iran which Qatar favors As they did with President Barack Obama the members signed a communique with Trump pledging unity The Saudis took action against Qatar less than 24hours after Trump left RiyadhEven as Trump was tweeting his approval Tillerson and Mattis traveling together in Australia called for calm and mediation The Pentagons air operations for the Middle East and the conflicts in Syria Iraq and Afghanistan are headquartered at a large air base in Qatar home to at least 10000 US service membersThroughout the week the Pentagon has emphasized that the dispute has not affected its operations  Qatar the worlds largest exporter of liquefied natural gas has long been an influential regional player In addition to its dialogue with Iran it has raised the ire of its gulf neighbors over its support for the Muslim Brotherhood viewed by Saudi Arabia Egypt and other authoritarian countries as extremist and a threat to their existence Qatar has used its wealth to also support groups such as Hamas in the Gaza StripSaudi Arabia too has come under scrutiny for indirectly supporting extremist networks that promote the kingdoms archconservative Wahhabi interpretation of IslamIn his statement Tillerson said the US expectation was that these countries will immediately take steps to deescalate the situation He said that the United States supported regional mediation efforts and that it is clear to me  that the elements of a solution are availableHe called on Qatar to be responsive to the concerns of its neighbors Qatar has a history of supporting groups that have spanned the spectrum of political expression from activism to violence Tillerson said While the emir of Qatar has made progress in halting financial support and expelling terrorist elements from his country  he must do more and he must do it quicklyIn comments apparently addressed to Saudi Arabia and its partners however he said Others must also continue to eliminate  support for violent extremism within their own borders  Trump on the same theme said For Qatar we want you back among the unity of responsible nations We ask Qatar and other nations in the region to do more and do it fasterTrump also appeared to issue a more generalized call for changed behavior in the region although he did not mention political reforms I want to call on all of the nations to stop immediately supporting terrorism stop teaching people to kill other people stop filling their minds with hate and intolerance he said I wont name other countries but we are not done solving the problemHours before the US statements on Friday the four Arab nations that cut ties with Qatar placed dozens of people and groups with suspected links to the nation on a terrorism blacklist deepening the disputeSaudi Arabia the UAE Bahrain and Egypt designated 59 individuals and 12 charities as terrorists in a joint statement published by the Saudi news agency The list included the spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood as well as several Qatari-funded charities  In a joint statement the Saudis and their partners said they had created the list because of the continuous and ongoing violations of the authorities in Doha of Qatars commitments and obligationsIt included 18 Qatari citizens accused of financing terrorism well-known business executives politicians and top members of Qatars ruling family In addition to the Muslim Brotherhoods leader Egyptian-born cleric Youssef al-Qaradawi 25 other Egyptian nationals were included on the list Shiite Muslim groups in Bahrain allegedly linked to Iran were also on the list as were citizens of Libya Kuwait the UAE and YemenIn its own statement the Qatari government said that the list reinforces baseless allegations that hold no foundation in fact  The Government of the State of Qatar strongly condemns terrorism in all its forms We do not have not and will not support terrorist groups said the statement Indeed our position on countering terrorism is stronger than many of the signatories of the joint statement  a fact that has been conveniently ignored by the authorsThe terror list came a day after Bahrain and the UAE declared it a crime punishable by multi-year prison sentences to show sympathy or favoritism to Qatar or criticize both governments actions toward Qatar through social media or other waysMeanwhile Al Jazeera the Qatari-funded television network said on Thursday that its website and digital platforms were under cyberattack and facing systematic and continual hacking attemptsOther regional players have come out in support of QatarLate Thursday Turkeys president Recep Tayyip Erdogan approved legislation passed by parliament to deploy Turkish troops in Qatar expediting a previously agreed pact on military cooperation between the two countriesTurkey has also promised to send food and water supplies to Qatar if needed The diplomatic dispute has led to closures of Qatars borders and access to neighboring airspace threatening Qatars regional trade relationships as well as the air routes of its national carrier Qatar AirwaysAt the State Department Tillerson called on the kingdom of Saudi Arabia the UAE Bahrain and Egypt to ease the blockage against Qatar saying there were humanitarian consequences including shortages of food and families being forceably separated Children pulled out of schoolWe believe these are unintended consequences especially during this holy month of Ramadan he said but they cant be underestimated The blockade is also impairing US and other international business activities and is hindering US military actions and the campaign against ISIS an acronym for the Islamic StateStressing the importance of GCC unity Tillerson said the United States had spoken to all the leaders involved and said to all of them we know you are stronger together Raghavan reported from Doha Thomas Gibbons-Neff in Washington contributed to this reportTOKYO  President Trump donned a military-style bomber jacket shortly after arriving Sunday in Japan and projected confidence that the United States will confront threats in Asia telling hundreds of US troops that they will have his administrations support to fight to overpower and to always always always winTrumps tough talk in a speech to US and Japanese military personnel at Yokota Air Base shortly after Air Force One touched down here aimed to set a tone for his five-nation tour during which the president said he is likely to meet with Russian President Vladimir PutinThe president told reporters during his flight here that he wants Putins help on North Korea as his administration attempts to consolidate support for its strategy to pressure Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons programHistory has proven over and over that the road of the tyrant is a steady march towards poverty suffering and servitude Trump told the troops perhaps referring obliquely to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un whose name he did not mention Noting that he has proposed a bigger military budget Trump surveyed the troops in an air base hangar and declared Weve got a lot of stuff coming use it wellThe boisterous scene during which the troops cheered and chanted USA was closely watched in capitals across Northeast Asia where governments from Seoul to Beijing are looking for signals of how Trump will address the threat on his first trip to the region The presidents heightened rhetoric aimed at North Korea and the Kim regime has set the region on edge over concerns that increasing tensions could result in a military confrontation  On the plane Trump told reporters that heplans to decide very soon whether to relabel North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism The North spent 10 years on that list before being removed in 2008 by the George W Bush administration for meeting nuclear inspection requirements Pyongyang later violated the agreementBut Trump also offered encouragement for North Korean citizens calling them great peopleTheyre industrious theyre warm much warmer than the world really knows and understands he told reporters on the plane Theyre great people and I hope it all works out for everybody And it would be a wonderful thing if it could work for those great people and for everybodyAnd he seemed unconcerned about the prospect that North Korea might use his trip to the region to demonstrate its military might by firing a missile Well soon find out he said Good luckAfter speaking at the air base Trump spent the day with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe playing nine holes of golf though a White House official said they did not keep score At the golf course Abe took pains to ensure Trump felt comfortable He presented Trump with white baseball caps with the embroidered words Donald and Shinzo Make Alliance Even Greater which both men signed and he served Trump who can be picky about his food a burger specially made from American beefOn Monday the two will hold formal bilateral meetings to talk about security and trade first lady Melania Trump who is accompanying her husband on the trip will join the president for a morning meeting with Japanese Emperor Akihito and then take part in separate slate of eventsTrump & Abe signing white ball caps that read Donald and Shinzo Make Alliance Even Greater  Michael C Bender (@MichaelCBender) The golf outing aimed to recreate the bond the two men forged during Abes visit in February to Trumps Florida resort Mar-a-Lago where they played a round It was while the two leaders dined together that evening that Kim launched a missile test prompting an angry condemnation from both men at a joint statement to reporters in FloridaSome national security experts have cautioned that Kim could choose to conduct another test during Trumps 12 days in the region to try to upstage himNorth Koreas goal is not to simply acquire horrific weapons to maintain the status quo said a senior White House official who briefed reporters in Tokyo on the condition of anonymity They are seeking these weapons to change the status quo Their primary goal is to reunify the Korean Peninsula and these weapons are part of the planTrump who had spent Saturday night in Honolulu and toured Pearl Harbor seemed in buoyant spirits Sunday He wore an unbuttoned open-collared white shirt with no tie to chat with the press on Air Force One and heenthusiastically donned the brown leather bomber jacket presented to him by Air Force officers at YokotaI like this better he joked after replacing his navy blue suit coat  Trump confirmed that he expects to meet with Putinprobably on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Da Nang Vietnam later in the trip The meeting would come as special counsel Robert S Mueller IIIs probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia has heated up Last week Mueller indicted three people in Trumps orbit  two senior campaign aidesand one lower-level unpaid volunteer  as part of his ongoing investigationBut the president who has often expressed admiration for authoritarian leaders has remained reluctant to criticize PutinThe president also promised that trade will also be a key focus of his trip with China  a frequent target of his trade-related ire  looming largest on the economic front Chinese President Xi Jinpingconsolidated power last month at the 19th Communist Party Congress and Trump is preparing to face a newly emboldened Xi on his home turfI think were going in with tremendous strength Trump saidWhen a reporter asked him about Xis elevated position the president cut off the questioner saying Excuse me so am IHe then rattled off a laundry list of highlights of US power including the surging stock market low unemployment and success in combating the Islamic State in the Middle EastI think hes viewing us as very very strong and also very friendly Trump said But we have to do better with trade with China because its a one-way street right now and it has been for many years And we will But the reason our stock market is so successful is because of me Ive always been great with money  Trump noted that he will spend the first anniversary of his Election Day victory in Beijing on Wednesday and he facetiously invited the traveling press corps to help him celebrateCan you believe it is almost exactly one year he said Well have to celebrate togetherThe president didnt even let a question about a  of him from former presidents George HW Bush and George W Bush spoil his good moodIll comment after we come back he said I dont need headlines I dont want to make their book successfulThe Iranian-supplied rockets were raining down on Gen James N Mattiss troops throughout the spring and summer of 2011 with greater and greater intensitySix American soldiers were by a volley in eastern Baghdad in early June A few weeks later three more Americans died in a similar strike driving the monthly death toll to 15 It was the  for US troops in Iraq in more than two years and Irans proxies were vowing more rockets and more bloodshedMattis the top American commander in the Middle East was determined to send a clear message to Tehran to stop it His proposal crafted with the support of the ambassador and the senior American commander in Iraq was to hit back inside Iran said current and former senior US officials who took part in the debateOne option was a dead-of-night US strike against an Iranian power plant or oil refinery said the officials speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive operationsYou could let them know that we have rockets too one senior US official said of the options forwarded by Mattis to WashingtonMattiss proposals quickly reached the White House which had a different view of how to curb Irans increasingly aggressive behavior To President Obama a US strike on Iranian soil would only inflame a volatile situation and widen a conflict that he had promised to end Others in the White House worried that Mattiss proposal risked starting yet another war in the Middle EastThe battle over how to respond to the mounting American casualties in summer 2011 reflected the deepening divide between the president and his top commander in the Middle East In a White House worried about  and the unintended consequences of military action Mattis was the voice from the field consistently calling for a tougher responseThere were clearly White House staff who thought the recommendations he was making were too aggressive said Leon E Panetta who was defense secretary at the time But I thought a lot of that was frankly not having the maturity to look at all of the options that a president should look at in order to make the right decisionsUltimately Mattiss advocacy and aggressive style the White House and the president he was servingNow Mattis will play a different role for a new commander in chief As President-elect Donald Trumps choice to lead the Pentagon Mattis will oversee a force of nearly 13 million active-duty troops scattered across more than 150 countries He will serve a president who has the impartiality of Americas intelligence agencies and has moved in often puzzling ways to longtime adversaries such as Russian President Vladimir Putin He has emphasized the value of unpredictability over careful deliberation and raw power over diplomacyMattiss falling out with the Obama administration especially over Iran offers a perspective into how the retired four-star Marine general will lead the worlds largest military and the advice he will bring to Trump during the most sensitive Situation Room debatesThe heated discussions in 2011 over how to respond to the Iranian rockets stretched on for weeksThere were concerns about proportionality effectiveness and whether the Iranians would escalate said one former Pentagon official who took part in the discussions Could you actually hit the guys who were responsible as opposed to some random entity Would it be anything more than a pinprick How do you do something more than a pinprick without starting a conflictIn the end Mattis was authorized to take action inside Iraq against the leaders of the Iranian-backed militiasSenior White House officials said the American military response effectively deterred the Iranians and slowed the rocket attacks that were killing US soldiers and Marines Only 10 Americans died in Iraq during the last five months of 2011It was a very tough tough period a former senior White House official said And it was a very tough responseMattis and some of his allies who favored a cross-border operation had a different takeaway The American response slowed the attacks against US troops in Iraq but it also demonstrated that the Obama White House was unwilling to take the fight directly to the Iranians even when they drew American bloodThe American response solved the immediate problem of Iranian-backed attacks but was not sufficient to deter Iran from further challenges to the US military throughout the region one senior US official involved in the deliberations saidFor much of the Obama presidency Iran loomed as one of the toughest and most volatile foreign policy problems A big part of that challenge was managing Israel the United States closest ally in the region but one that might take unilateral action against IranIsraeli leaders were sending mixed messages to Obama and his top advisers about how far they were willing to go to stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon Then-Defense Minister Ehud Barak briefed his Pentagon counterparts on secret plans to launch a commando-style raid on Irans most heavily fortified nuclear site Israels Mossad intelligence service in turn privately told the Americans that the Israelis could not act against Iran alone The White House was never certain whom to believeMattiss job at Central Command was to be prepared if Israel triggered a war and to signal to the Iranians that the outcome of any wider conflict with the United States would be devastating for them It was a responsibility that Mattis took seriously sometimes too seriously for those at the White House and the State Department current and former officials saidSoon after Mattis was tapped to lead US forces in the Middle East in August 2010 Obama asked the general to spell out his top priorities Mattis replied that he had three Number one Iran Number two Iran Number three Iran said a senior US official who was present The generals singular focus unnerved some civilian leaders who thought he should pay attention to a broader range of threatsHis style and Marine swagger often struck the wrong chord in a White House that was focused on diplomacy and that was notably short of top officials with military experience Mattis and his aides relentlessly drilled the US militarys war plan for Iran During one planning session which focused on the wars aftermath and included senior officials from Washington Mattis repeatedly joked that Irans navy would be at the bottom of the ocean participants saidHis preparations for a possible conflict also rattled some US diplomats whom Mattis invited to Central Commands regional headquarters in Qatar in 2011 for briefings on how Iran might strike back at US allies and facilities Some of the diplomats had the impression that Mattis was describing a World War III scenario one ambassador saidAmong the greatest dangers in the region was uncertainty and some White House officials worried that Iran might misread Mattiss war preparations as an act of aggression At the time the United States had no direct channels of communication with the Iranian military to de-escalate tensionsOn occasion the US military would conduct exercises designed to send messages to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps about Americas seriousness During and after those maneuvers US spy agencies would monitor the Iranians reactions Sometimes the Iranians missed the intended signal suggesting to the Americans that they did not notice what the United States had done At other times they seemed to react to American actions that were not intended to be provocativeThe fog of war was enormous a former senior Pentagon official saidMattis proposed opening a direct channel with the Iranian military to mitigate the risk of miscalculation But the White House worried about sparking a diplomatic backlash rejected the proposalIn this atmosphere of growing tension Mattis began pressing for more authority to hit the Iranians hard if it looked as though Tehran was shifting to a war footing Irans first move in a fight with the United States or Israel probably would be to drop mines into the Strait of Hormuz choking off the Middle Easts oil supplyMattis asked for permission to strike Iranian fast boats as soon as the United States had solid intelligence that the Iranians were loading them with mines His rationale was that the boats were most vulnerable when they were still in port and that a swift blow could cripple Irans war effort before it had even startedHis number one objective was to prevent the war from breaking out by being ready to preempt the Iranians a former senior military officer said If he had taken the Iranian swarm boats out with mines in them then that was going to be it for themThe White House worried that bad intelligence or a rash judgment could trigger an unnecessary war with Iran Its understandable that if we were going to engage in an act of war in the Strait of Hormuz that the president ought to play a key role Panetta saidBut Panetta added it also was Mattiss job to offer the president his best military advice and options The United States would have only a few hours to act after Iran began loading the mines Once the mines were in place Mattis knew reopening the strait could take three weeks and lead to US casualtiesThe end result of the heated debate in late 2011 and early 2012 was a compromise Obama would bypass the White Houses careful and cumbersome policy process and decide on an expedited basis whether to strike the fast boats Panetta saidMattiss bold moves were seen as helpful when the White House was trying to press Iran into talks to curb its nuclear program His brash style was also a reassurance to Israeli leaders threatening to launch unilateral strikes The Israelis may have Obamas willingness to use force against Iran to prevent it from building a nuclear bomb But they believed Mattis was seriousIn time however as secret talks with Iran got underway in the summer of 2012 some White House officials began to see Mattis as a potential liabilityEach week Mattis wrote a classified letter to the defense secretary that was forwarded to the White House Typically Mattiss updates focused on Irans support for terrorism and its destabilizing activities throughout the region To the White House these threats were secondary to restricting Irans nuclear program and Mattiss hard-nosed approach as outlined in the weekly letters was seen by some as out of step with the presidents top foreign diplomatic priorityEventually higher-ups in the Pentagon encouraged Mattis to shift his focus away from Iran and concentrate on the rest of the Central Command region which encompassed all of the Middle East as well as Afghanistan and Pakistan The feedback was to tone down the Iran stuff in the letter one former military official said Basically they said it wouldnt hurt to talk about something elseMattis often said it was his role to act as Americas sentinel in the Middle East He refused to soften his assessmentsIt was a kind of culture clash said Dennis Ross who advised Obama on Iran policy There was such a preoccupation in the White House with not doing things that would provoke Iran or be seen as provocative Mattis was by definition inclined toward doing those things that would be seen as provocative And as time went by this became increasingly less acceptable to themIn early 2013 the general was told he was being replaced five months early Inside the White House Mattiss early departure was not viewed as a firing He had not behaved unethically or rebelled against his civilian chain of commandJim Mattis was not a runaway general said Matthew Spence a senior administration official who worked closely with Mattis There was a very unfair impression that he was coming out of the trenches and only saying go go go In reality he was one of the most thoughtful strategists in uniform that I have ever worked withBut Mattis had a different view of his departure He was convinced that he had been dismissed early for running afoul of the White House friends and former colleagues saidNow Mattis is poised to serve a new commander in chief whose brash approach could force the former general into a new and unfamiliar role When Iranian naval vessels were harassing American warships this summer in the Strait of Hormuz Trump responded with a When they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they shouldnt be allowed to make they will be shot out of the water Trump said to thunderous applause at a campaign rallyAs defense secretary Mattis may be compelled to act as a check on an inexperienced presidents instincts There are already some signs that he is thinking along these lines and indications that his task will not be an easy oneShortly after Trump tapped him to lead the Pentagon Mattis asked Michle Flournoy the front-runner for the defense secretary job in a Hillary Clinton White House to consider serving as his deputyMattiss courtship of Flournoy suggested a bias for continuity over radical change and underscored his determination to be an independent voice in White House policy debatesFlournoy visited Trump Tower in New York to discuss the job with senior Trump foreign policy advisers Soon after she decided her differences with the president-elect were too deep to accept the positionSeveral weeks later Mattis is still searching for a deputyCorey Stewart may have lost Virginias Republican nomination for governor but he is feeling newly emboldened as Ed Gillespie the candidate who defeated him has co-opted the polarizing issues at the center of his political playbook In television commercials and on the stump Gillespie has laid claim to defending Confederate monuments and linking the Latino gang MS-13 to undocumented immigrants aping President Trumps populist agenda as channeled by Stewart in his near-upset in last Junes GOP primary It feels like my campaign doesnt it Stewart said of Gillespies commercials as Tuesdays election loomed his fulsome grin punctuating his delight I feel vindicated by it What is it that they say Imitation is the best form of flattery A cocksure disciple of Trump Stewart was dismissed as an unknown underfunded candidate by Virginias GOP establishment when he challenged Gillespie the former lobbyist Republican Party chair and advisor to President George W Bush But the mockery turned to astonishment when Stewart chair of Prince Williams Countys Board of Supervisors came within a percentage point of victory albeit in a low-turnout primary Now as Gillespie has appropriated his tactics and polls suggest he has narrowed the gap with Democrat Lt Gov Ralph Northam Stewarts stature as a political force is growing as he seeks to challenge Sen Tim Kaine (D) next yearCorey Stewart is the reason Gillespie is going to win Stephen K Bannon the former White House chief strategist and Trumps campaign czar said in an interview It was the Trump-Stewart talking points that got Gillespie close and even maybe to victory It was embracing Trumps agenda as personified by Coreys platform This was not a competitive race four weeks ago You could have stuck a fork in GillespieBannon described Stewart as the titular head of the Trump movement in the commonwealth even as he volunteered that he was the one who issued the order to fire Stewart as Trumps Virginia co-chair during the 2016 campaign But he said he did so to placate Reince Preibus who was infuriated that Stewart -- ignoring a command from GOP leaders -- held a protest outside the Republican National Committees Washington headquarters to complain that the party wasnt fully embracing Trump  I think the reason we didnt win Virginia is that we fired Corey  otherwise we would have been more competitive Bannon said I was a Corey Stewart fan at the time but I had to keep peace in the valleyVirginia was the only Southern state to go for Hillary Clinton who beat Trump by five points Bannon is now leading an effort to target establishment Republican senators aligned with Senate Majority Leader Sen Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) in next years mid-term elections But he said he also has an eye on Kaine and that insurgent Republicans see Virginia in play The only way to beat Kaine next year is with a full on Trump agenda and by nationalizing the race with a candidate like Corey Stewart Bannon said It has to be someone who can articulate the Trump agenda   No other Republicans have declared an intention to run for the Senate seat yetBannons view of Stewart is not shared by Virginias Republican establishment which may be why Gillespie has refrained from appearing with him on the campaign trailIf Alabama had [former Gov George] Wallace Virginia gets Stewart--its massive resistance 20 said Shaun Kenney former executive director of the commonwealths Republican Party He was referring to the strategy to fight desegregation in Virginia declared in the 1950s by Sen Harry F Byrd a conservative Democrat and power broker Corey is running because Gillespie couldnt put him away Kenney said Its not a vindication as much as it is a mestastization Its like turning your back on a bad debt At some point the interest comes due and the interest in this case is the nationalist wing of the party They feel strength now  Democrats for their part struggle to contain their glee over Stewart as Kaines potential challenger How lucky could you be to get Corey Stewart running against you in a general election asked state Sen Richard Saslaw (D-Fairfax) I pray for it Corey Stewart is lucky hes not in a straight jacket    For all his populist zeal Stewart is a veritable lord of the manner residing on an 18th century plantation in Prince William County once owned by George Washingtons first biographer and where Washington is said to have spent a nightStewart and his Swedish-born wife Maria have furnished their 13-room home with Victorian settees and oil paintings that they bought at antique auctions The plantations 25 acres include countless trees manicured hedges and not a single yard sign promoting Virginias Republican candidate for governor (two signs for Jill Vogel running for lieutenant governor were leaning against the garage door) Weve got to get one weve got to get one Stewart said of a Gillespie sign his tone not exactly oozing urgency as he got int his red pick up truck last week on his way for lunch at a nearby restaurant While he tells Republican audiences he will vote for Gillespie and says they should too Stewart struggles to show enthusiasm for a candidate he describes as boring Hes your standard Republican  very cautious very reluctant to go out on the edge on any controversial issue said Stewart between bites of a salmon salad with goat cheese and champagne vinaigrette dressing But Stewart said he was pleasantly surprised to see Gillespies ads about MS-13 and protecting monuments that were somewhat edgy It may be enough to bring him over the line Maybe not I was ahead of the game in addressing those issues  in fact I was even ahead of the president Stewart said of Trumps embrace of Confederate monuments He basically echoed the same words I usedAt Bannons urging Stewart said he has offered to campaign for Gillespie an offer he said that was being ignored even Sunday when the ticket was planning a closing rally in southwest Virginia Nevertheless Stewart has sought to promote the Republican ticket appearing at a Bikers for Trump rally last weekend where he roused the crowd when he proclaimed four categories of Democrats -- criminals communists crackheads and the weirdosIn the interview Stewart said if hes the GOPs nominee against Kaine he would focus more on economic issues while expecting the Democrats to attack him for defending the monuments and for being anti-immigrant Then Im going to say to the people Look the Democrats are focusing on this garbage Im talking about the economy he said Tim Kaine is the radical the Democrats are the radicalsStewart said that type of tactic has served him well as he has won four elections in Prince William a Democratic majority county I always focus on the issues that people are concerned with at that time he said Some might say Isnt that being an opportunist From my perspective its simply addressing the needs of the people you represent As Trump likes to brand opponents on Twitter Stewart tagged Gillespie as Establishment Ed in the primary and hes already asking supporters help him conceive monikers for Kaine whom he described as a little weird Crazy Kaine Kooky Kaine he said offering potential nicknames People think he looks like The Joker  crazy psychotic unhingedIan Sams a spokesman for the Kaine campaign dismissed Stewart Who cares what Corey Stewart wants to nickname anyone Sams said Corey runs around doing his best Donald Trump impression and next to nothing for his constituents in Prince William County Hes devoid of ideas to make Virginians lives better and instead wants to run a pig sty campaign driven by ugly headlines While Corey hurls insults Tim Kaine is fighting in the Senate to protect Virginians health care help create jobs and keep Americans safeStewart makes no apologies for his coarse language saying We need some honesty Thats what people want Theyre tired of being placated by soft fake words If he wins a Senate seat he promises to be provocative and hard-charging and to the right of every other member of the United States Senate I will be deliberately pushing buttonsShifting the political spectrum to the right jerking the country back to the right  thats what I want to do he said If you want to energize the base you have to talk about these emotional issuesAt moments he acknowledged he goes too farHe said he regrets for example appearing during the primary campaign at a press conference with members of the right wing group known as Unity and Security for America that was protesting the removal of a Robert E Lee statue in downtown Charlottesville Stewart said he was unaware of extremist positions taken by the groups leader Jason Kessler who later organized a white supremacist rally in CharlottesvilleWhen I realized what he was I had nothing to do with him Stewart said We should have done a better job finding out who he was I make mistakes Thats not who I am I dont have to agree with everybody but there are some things that are so reprehensible you want nothing to do with themHe also expressed regret for having recently poked fun at the transgender candidate challenging state Del Bob Marshall (R-Prince William) His name was Dan Roem Now its Danica Roem he told the Bikers for Trump rally eliciting laughs Not that theres anything wrong with thatReflecting on that moment five days later Stewart said I dont want to make fun of anybody like that I dont like to bully people like thatStewart said he tests his rhetorical missiles on a group of advisors before firing For example he said that when conceiving of his four categories of Democrats he had planned on including hypocrites and perverts But he replaced hypocrites with communists because its not hard enough And he scrapped perverts because women dont like that termSo he went with weirdosEvery once in awhile youre going to say something over the top Stewart said But that way at least people know youre realWhen Saudi Arabia and a number of other major Arab states announced last week that they were cutting diplomatic relations with Qatar the first reaction of many in the tiny Gulf state was simple Head to the supermarket Thats because almost all food products in Qatar are imported usually across the now-closed land border with Saudi ArabiaThe country may be oil-rich but most of its landmass is desert and unsuitable for agricultureAs photos of barren supermarket shelves  many feared the worst But one Qatari businessman has offered a partial solution Flyin 4000 cowsMoutaz Al Khayyat chairman of Power International Holding told  that it may take 60 flights to deliver all the cows This is the time to work for Qatarhe told the news agencyKhayyat had already been planning to expand his companys agricultural business he told Bloomberg News The plan has now been expedited so that by mid-July he can cover a third of Qatars demand for dairy products Although the facilities for the cows were already built Khayyat said the shipping cost for the animals would increase five times to $8 millionA request for comment from Power International Holding was not immediately returnedQatari authorities have repeatedly dismissed concerns about the countrys food supply We can live forever like this foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told reporters in Doha on adding that only 16 percent of Qatars food imports came through the now-closed land border crossing with Saudi Arabia Over recent days a social media campaign to show off goods that were made in Qatar has spread online   Hajermohamed (@Hajeralmerri) Analysts have had their doubts howeverQatar receives 99 percent of its food from outside Theodore Karasik a senior adviser with Washington-based Gulf State Analytics told  They are wholly dependent on outside supplies particularly with foodstuffs Karasik said that a decade ago the country was estimated to have only a few days of emergency food supplies at bestIran and Turkey have flown in food supplies to Qatar over recent days while the country has launched new shipping routes via Oman tomaintain its supply of food from other sources Some Qataris seem to be extremely grateful I will never buy Saudi Arabian and UAE products again a Qatari man leaving the Al Meera supermarket told  I will stay loyal to the people who support us nowThe economic blockade and diplomatic isolation of Qatar led by Saudi Arabia Bahrain the United Arab Emirates and Egypt was ordered last week after they accused the country of supporting terrorismRepublican gubernatorial candidate Corey A Stewart told an audience at a Northern Virginia synagogue Sunday night that he blames the political left for rising anti-Semitism stunning many in the audience who felt Stewart excused bigotry coming from his own supportersToday most of the anti-Semitic bigotry is not coming from the right Its coming from the left We have to face it said Stewart prompting a collective gasp and incredulous laughter from the crowd of about 400 at Temple Rodef Shalom in Fairfax CountyStewart who is significantly lagging in his campaign for the Republican nomination behind front-runner Ed Gillespie has made the defense of the states Confederate heritage a mainstay of his bid and has attracted support from white supremacists But in his remarks Stewart ticked off three instances  including one more than a decade old  in which Democrats had been labeled anti-Semitic or sexistWhat about Keith Ellison from Minnesota Stewart said referring to the Democratic congressman who has been criticized by some for his earlier support for Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan Audience members shouted back What about TrumpStewart received the iciest reception of the four candidates who appeared at the forum which was sponsored by the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington He participated with one of his Republican rivals state Sen Frank W Wagner (Virginia Beach) and Democrats Tom Perriello a former congressman and Ralph Northam the states lieutenant governor The only missing candidate was Gillespie His communications director said the candidate was attending a campaign event for state Del Margaret Ransone (R-Kinsale) His campaign finance director delivered remarks on his behalf at Temple Rodef Shalom The candidates appeared one at a time to deliver remarks and then answer questions that had been submitted through an online forum   Guila Franklin Siegel the associate director of the JCRC agreed that its important to address bigotry on all ends of the political spectrum but said she was disheartened by Stewarts remarksI thought it was disappointing he didnt take the opportunity to speak about what he could do within his own sphere of influence to combat anti-Semitism and all other forms of bigotry and intolerance instead of looking at what other people are doing in other parts of the political spectrum Siegel said The comments from Stewart the chairman of the Prince William Board of County Superviors come amid rising anxiety in the Jewish community about the increasing frequency acts of anti-Semitism including recent vandalism at the Jewish Community Center of Northern Virginia Police said the man arrested in the case had connections to the Aryan Underground  Many attendees in this Democratic stronghold were less concerned with Stewarts remarks and more focused on choosing between Perriello and NorthamSang Moore a 42-year-old manager at a credit union who lives in Falls Church said she was still undecided but leaning toward voting for Northam because of his experience in state government where he served as a lawmaker before being elected lieutenant governor In her eyes it gave him an edge over Perriello who lost his congressional seat in 2010 after one term and then worked for a left-leaning think tank before becoming a special envoy in Africa for the State Department Perriellos experience while vast and impressive is not Ralph Northams Moore said Perriello and Northam are locked in a neck-and-neck battle for the Democratic nomination according to polls Perriello panned President Trump on Sunday and blamed his rhetoric for increasing acts of racism and hate in the region He cited the vandalism at the Jewish Community Center the harassment of a woman in a hijab at a Trader Joes in Reston Va and a torchlight rally organized by white supremacists in Charlottesville to protest the proposed removal of a statue of Robert E Lee  We have to be honest that we stand at a scary moment where weve seen the kind of hatred and bigotry unleashed and enabled from the president himself those around him and those who stand beside him Perriello saidPerriello also touted his experience working as a negotiator in Africa saying it demonstrates his ability to work through disagreements If we can bring together people who have literally been killing each other for years weve got to find a way to find common ground he said Northams remarks garnered the most applause The soft-spoken pediatric neurologist talked of treating toddlers for gunshot wounds after mishaps with firearms and domestic violence victims shot by their partners as evidence of the need for stricter gun control including restricting gun purchases to one per monthNobody needs to buy more than one gun a month Northam said Wagner who is running third in the GOP race just behind Stewart in the latest Washington Post-Schar School poll mentioned how he once ran a company with a prominent Jewish businessman He spoke of his proposal to revamp the high school curriculum to give students the flexibility to take career and technical education courses Somebody with a good career and technical background and industry credentials is going to earn more money than a college graduate Wagner saidHe also pitched his proposal to raise the fuel tax to improve the transportation infrastructure We have to make a bigger investment in transportation if we expect the Virginia economy to grow Wagner said Both parties will choose their nominees in a June 13 primary and the general election will be in November May 22 is the last day to register to vote in the primaryBahrain on Thursday declared it a crime punishable by imprisonment of up to five years and a fine to show sympathy or favoritism to Qatar or to object in any way to Bahrains decision to break relations and impose economic and border restrictions on the neighboring Persian Gulf countryA similar statement by the United Arab Emirates with a possible 15-year penalty was issued Wednesday prohibiting criticism of that government or sympathy toward Qatar whether it be through the means of social media or any type of written visual or verbal formThe measures in countries where civil rights are already sharply restricted came as AlJazeera the state-funded Qatari media organization said its website and digital platforms were under cyberattack and facing systematic and continual hacking attemptsPresident Trump met Thursday at the White House with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to discuss the situation and reiterated his proposal that Tillerson help mediate  according to State Department spokeswoman Heather NauertBut the American preference is for the GCC countries to arrive at a solution of their own Nauert said  On Monday three members of the six-nation GCC or Persian Gulf Cooperation Council  Saudi Arabia the UAE and Bahrain  severed relations with Qatar a fourth member They were joined by Egypt and since then several other Arab nationsIn statements the Saudis and the others have demanded that Qatar distance itself from Iran and stop support for terrorist groups Qatar has to realize its interests are with us not with another country that conspires against us wants to dominate and divide us Bahrain Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmad al-Khalifa told Asharq al-Awsat a Saudi-owned newspaperOther countries including Turkey have voiced support for Qatar Kuwait and Oman within the GCC have tried to mediateTrumps offer of US mediation was first voiced in a telephone call Wednesday with Qatars emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad al-Thani in which the president offered to hold a meeting of regional leaders at the White HouseA White House readout of the call took a markedly different tone from Trumps first comments on the rift in Twitters postings Monday congratulating Saudi Arabia for taking action against Qatar Trump also credited his own meetings with the Saudis the GCC and other Muslim leaders in Riyadh late last month with sparking the actionThose initial tweets also differed sharply from statements by Tillerson and Mattis who at the time were visiting Australia and called for Persian Gulf unity The United States directs its air wars in Syria Iraq and Afghanistan from a huge air base in Qatar where more than 10000 US service members are stationedOn Wednesday the readout of Trumps call to Qatar said he reiterated that a united GCC and its partnership with the United States are critical to defeating terrorism and promoting regional stabilityIn the past the Treasury Department has said that Saudi Arabia and Qatar among others in the region have provided support for Sunni extremist groups More recently it has said that governments in the gulf have taken steps to stop money flows but it has singled out Kuwait and to a lesser extent Qatar for failing to stop terrorism financing by individuals in those nationsA number of regional experts have charged that Trumps lavish praise of Saudi King Salman during his visit to Riyadh effectively encouraged that kingdom to act on long-standing disputes with Qatar over its less restrictive foreign and domestic policies and what the Saudis charge is biased reporting by Al JazeeraQatars foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani speaking to reporters in Doha on Thursday said his government had not received a list of specific demands from the Saudi-led bloc but he suggested Qatar was unwilling to modify its policies to satisfy their complaintsWe are not ready to surrender and will never be ready to surrender the independence of our foreign policy Thani said according to AlJazeera Kareem Fahim in Istanbul contributed to this reportIn November 2015 Stephen K Bannon  then the executive chairman of Breitbart News  was hosting a satellite radio show His guest was Rep Ryan Zinke (R-Mont) who opposed President Obamas plan to resettle some Syrian refugees in the United StatesWe need to put a stop on refugees until we can vet Zinke saidBannon cut him offWhy even let em in he askedBannon said that vetting refugees from Muslim-majority countries would cost money and time Cant that money be used in the United States he said Should we just take a pause and a hiatus for a number of years on any influx from that area of the worldIn the years before Bannon grabbed the worlds attention as President Trumps chief White House strategist he was developing and articulating a fiery populist vision for remaking the United States and its role in the worldBannons past statements aired primarily on Breitbart and other conservative platforms serve as a road map for the controversial agenda that has roiled Washington and shaken the global order during Trumps first two weeks in officeNow at the center of power in the White House Bannon is moving quickly to turn his ideas into policy helping direct the biggest decisions of Trumps administration The withdrawal from a major trade pact A ban on all visitors from seven majority-Muslim countries And  in an echo of that conversation with Zinke who is now Trumps nominee for interior secretary  there was a temporary ban on all new refugeesThe result has been intense fury from Democrats discomfort among many Republicans and a growing sense of unease in the world that Trump intends to undermine an America-centered world that has lasted 70 years This sense of turmoil welcomed by many Trump supporters as proof that the new president is following through on his vow to jolt Washington reflects the sort of transformation that Bannon has long called forThat worldview which Bannon laid out in interviews and speeches over the past several years hinges largely on Bannons belief in American sovereignty Bannon said that countries should protect their citizens and their essence by reducing immigration legal and illegal and pulling back from multinational agreementsAt the same time Bannon was concerned that the United States and the Judeo-Christian West were in a war against an expansionist Islamic ideology  but that they were losing the war by not recognizing what it was Bannon said this fight was so important it was worth overlooking differences and rivalries with countries like RussiaIt is not yet clear how far Bannon will be able to go to enact his agenda His early policy moves have been marred by administrative chaos But his worldview calls for bigger changes than those already madeIn the past Bannon had wondered aloud whether the country was ready to follow his lead Now he will find outIs that grit still there that tenacity that weve seen on the battlefields  fighting for something greater than themselves Bannon said in another radio interview last May before he joined the Trump campaignThat said Bannon is one of the biggest open questions in this countryBannon 62 is a former Navy officer and Goldman Sachs banker who made a fortune after he acquired a share of the royalties from a fledgling TV show called Seinfeld In the past 15 years he shifted into entertainment and conservative media making films about Ronald Reagan and Sarah Palin and then taking a lead role at Breitbart NewsAt Breitbart Bannon cemented his role as a voice for the alt-right the far-right movement that has attracted white supremacists and has found a home on the websiteBannon also forged a rapport with Trump interviewing the businessman-candidate on his show and then in August 2016 joining the campaign as chief executiveNow Bannon has become one of the most powerful men in America And hes not afraid to say soIn interviews with reporters since Trumps election Bannon has eschewed the traditional its-all-about-the-boss humility of presidential staffersDick Cheney Darth Vader Satan Thats power he told the Hollywood Reporter in November embracing the comparisons of him to those figuresIn the same interview Bannon compared himself to a powerful aide to Englands Henry VIII  an aide who helped engineer a world-shaking move of his era the split of the Church of England from the Catholic ChurchI am Thomas Cromwell in the court of the Tudors Bannon told the Hollywood ReporterTo explore Bannons worldview The Washington Post reviewed hours of radio interviews that Bannon conducted while hosting a Breitbart radio talk show as well as speeches and interviews he has given since 2014Bannon did not respond to a request for comment made on Tuesday afternoonIn his public statements Bannon espoused a basic idea that Trump would later seize as the centerpiece of his campaignWhile others saw the world rebounding from the financial crisis of 2008 Bannon just saw it becoming more divided by classThe elites that had caused the crisis  or at least failed to stop it  were now rising higher Everyone else was being left behindThe middle class the working men and women in the world  are just tired of being dictated to by what we call the party of Davos Bannon said in a 2014 speech to a conference at the Vatican in a recording obtained by BuzzFeed Davos is a Swiss ski resort that hosts an annual conclave of wealthy and powerful peopleBannon blamed both major political parties for this system and set out to force his ideas on an unwilling Republican leadershipWhat he wanted he said again and again was sovereignty Both in the United States and in its traditional allies in Western EuropeOn one of the first Breitbart Radio shows in early November 2015 Bannon praised the growing movement in Britain to exit the European Union He said that the British had joined the EU merely as a trading federation but that it had grown into a force that had stripped Britons of sovereignty in every aspect important to their own lifeBannon has been supportive of similar movements in other European countries to pull out of the union Trump has echoed those sentiments in his first few days as president It is a remarkable shift in US policy After decades of building multinational alliances as a guarantee of peace now the White House has indicated it may undermine themBannon in his 2014 speech at the Vatican cast this as a return to a better pastI think strong countries and strong nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors Bannon said And that is really the building blocks that built Western Europe and the United States and I think its what can see us forwardIn the case of the United States Bannon was skeptical of multinational trade pacts saying that they ceded control In a radio interview in November 2015 Sen Jeff Sessions (R-Ala) agreed with BannonWe shouldnt be tying ourselves down like Gulliver in the land of Lilliputians with so many strings a guy cant move said Sessions who is now Trumps nominee to become attorney general He was referring to a scene from the novel Gullivers Travels in which the hero is tied down by a race of tiny men That is where we are heading and its not necessaryOne solution put forward by Bannon the United States should pursue bilateral trade agreements  one country at a time  rather than multi-country agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership supported by ObamaHe suggested as much to Trump himself when the candidate appeared on his show in November 2015Trump brings [a deal] back to the Senate and gets his bilateral trade deal with Taiwan or with Japan approved by two-thirds of the Senate Bannon said And you have to go argue Hey this is why its a good deal And thats the way the Founders wanted itOn a March 2016 episode Bannon said that restoring sovereignty meant reducing immigration In his radio shows he criticized the federal H-1B visa programs that permit US companies to fill technical positions with workers from overseasThe progressive plutocrats in Silicon Valley Bannon said want unlimited ability to go around the world and bring people back to the United States Engineering schools Bannon said are all full of people from South Asia and East Asia  Theyve come in here to take these jobs Meanwhile Bannon said American students cant get engineering degrees they cant get into these graduate schools because they are all foreign students When they come out they cant get a jobDont we have a problem with legal immigration asked Bannon repeatedlyTwenty percent of this country is immigrants Is that not the beating heart of this problem he said meaning the problem of native-born Americans being unable to find jobs and rising wagesIn another show Bannon had complained to Trump that so many Silicon Valley chief executives were South Asian or Asian This was a rare time when Trump  normally receptive to Bannons ideas on-air  pushed back I still want people to come in Trump said But I want them to go through the processSo far Trump has made no changes to the high-skilled visa program This week White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that the Trump administration may reexamine the programEven as Bannon was calling for a general retreat from multinational alliances however he was warning of the need for a new alliance  involving only a subset of the worlds countriesThe Judeo-Christian West was at war he said but didnt seem to understand it yetThere is a major war brewing a war thats already global Bannon said at the Vatican in 2014 at a time when the Islamic State was gaining territory Every day that we refuse to look at this as what it is  and the scale of it and really the viciousness of it  will be a day where you will rue that we didnt actBannon has given few details about the mechanics of the war he thinks the West should fight But he has been clear that it is urgent enough to take priority over other rivalries and worriesIn his talk at the Vatican Bannon was asked about Russian President Vladimir Putin Bannons answer was two-sidedI think that Putin and his cronies are really a kleptocracy that are really an imperialist power that want to expand he said But Bannon said there were bigger concerns than Russia  and there was something to admire in Putins call for more traditional valuesHowever I really believe that in this current environment where youre facing a potential new caliphate that is very aggressive that is really a situation  Im not saying we can put [Russia] on a back burner  but I think we have to deal with first things first Bannon saidIf Bannon succeeds Bannons own comparison to Englands Thomas Cromwell might be apt  to a pointThe analogy  if its going to work  is that Bannon has his own agenda which he will try to use Trump for and will try to exploit the power that Trump has given him without his master always noticing said Diarmaid MacCulloch a professor of history at Englands Oxford UniversityBut Cromwell was later executed after Henry VIII turned against him For a man like that MacCulloch said power is always tenuous Its very much dependent on the favor of the kingSTILLWATER Okla Should Baker Mayfield hoist the Heisman Trophy in New York City next month the Oklahoma quarterback will likely look back on Saturdays  as the turning point in his candidacy for s most prestigious awardHe showed up at Boone Pickens Stadium for the latest edition of the Bedlam Series rivalry brimming with his usual swagger wearing a new handlebar mustache and running routes as a wide receiver during pregame warmups catching passes in the end zone with one hand as if he were Odell Beckham Jr Then he walked the walk completing 24 of 36 passes for five touchdowns and a mind-bending 598 yards a program record Sophomore wide receiver Marquise Brown caught nine of those passes for two touchdowns and 265 yards  another Sooners record and more than half of his season total entering the gameHes made for atmospheres like this This is his favorite thing in the world Oklahoma Coach Lincoln Riley said of Mayfield  Yet those performances had to be saved by an Oklahoma defense that had been torched for much of the afternoon With the Sooners ahead by three with just more than three minutes remaining Mayfield was intercepted in the end zone on third down But the Oklahoma defense  which yielded 652 yards forced only three punts and had allowed the Cowboys to convert each of the first three times they went for it on fourth down  came up with a crucialturnover on downsat the Oklahoma 38-yard line with 106 leftTwo plays later Trey Sermon burst through the line for 53 yards and one last touchdown to keep the Sooners College Football Playoff goals and Mayfields Heisman hopes intactIm not worried about winning that Mayfield said Im worried about winning games  Both of those ambitions were bolstered on a day of upsets across college football although this performance by Mayfield and the Sooners was impressive enough to render that help irrelevant Mayfield outdueled Oklahoma State quarterback Mason Rudolph who was hardly a slouch in passing for 448 yards and five touchdowns and pulling his team within three points twice in the second half It simply wasnt enough to upstage Mayfield who is now 13-0 in true road games during his career Oklahoma has won a national-best 15 consecutive road games including 13 straight true Big 12 road games which ties a conference recordNo matter how you put it we win ballgames Mayfield said If we keep winning we take care of our own destiny Im not exactly sure who lost across the country but our job is to winThe betting over-under for this game was set at 76 earlier this week but that was reached by halftime with the score tied at 38 Mayfield and Rudolph each threw for three touchdowns in a half that featured 857 yards of total offense For a while it seemed as if the Football Bowl Subdivision record of 1708 combined yards in a game  set last year by Oklahoma and Texas Tech  was in jeopardy In light of that perhaps the most stunning part of the first half was that Oklahoma opted to run out the clock inside its own territory with more than 30 seconds remainingRudolphs first major mistake of the second half came on the second drive of the half from his own 1-yard line when Oklahoma defensive lineman Kenneth Mann stripped him The ball hung in the air and was intercepted by linebacker Ogbonnia Okoronkwo That led to a field goal Rudolphs second major mistake of the half came on a first and goal from the 3 when he telegraphed a slant into double coverage and was picked off in the end zone by Sooners defensive back Will JohnsonWe made the plays when we had to Sooners defensive coordinator Mike Stoops saidMayfield looked exhausted in the late stages of a game that lasted well over four hours after throwing a 43-yard touchdown to running back Rodney Anderson on a wide-open wheel route late in the third quarter to make it 48-38 he limped back to the sideline with his head down before Anderson had even reached the end zone He found his second wind On the next possession he gunned a77-yard touchdown throw to Brownandresponded by running the length of his sideline high-stepping and clapping hands with his coaches and teammates celebrating yet another Heisman moment in an afternoon filled with themAfterward Mayfield showed Boone Pickens Stadium his greasy facial hair one last time as he walked back to the locker room his arm around senior cornerback Jordan ThomasThis is a game Mayfield said that Ill always rememberOver the past few weeks Carlos Batista noticed something odd  his neighbor Sayfullo Saipov would occasionally drive a Home Depot pickup truck on the block even though he didnt seem to be carrying any building material or doing any construction workBatista 23 said he noticed Saipov driving the truck around with a couple of his friendsThey didnt even have one piece of wood in there and thats why I found it a little suspicious Batista said And I do construction so I know when somebody is doing some type of workFederal agents suspect the early rentals were part of Saipovs preparation for the attack he carried out Tuesday   Eight people were killed and a dozen injured  the deadliest act of terrorism in New York City since the World Trade Center was felled by airplane hijackers in 2001 According to criminal charges filed Wednesday night Saipov rented the truck on Oct 22 to practice making turns with the vehicle in preparation for the attack The criminal complaint said Saipov confessed he began planning for it about a year ago  Saipov emigrated to the United States from Uzbekistan in 2010 and before moving to Paterson he lived in Ohio and Florida Counterterrorism officials say they had not previously investigated him but his name had surfaced in an FBI probe of a friend and he was named as a point of contact on immigration paperwork for other immigrantsLaw enforcement officials cautioned that in the small tightknit world of Uzbek immigrants to the United States it was not that unusual for Saipovs name to surface in multiple settings They added that until Monday federal agents had not found anything to prompt specific concerns about himIn his confession to authorities after the attack Saipov left no doubt about his motive  support for Islamic State also known as ISIS According to the criminal complaint filed against him Saipov requested to display ISISs flag in his hospital room and stated that he felt good about what he had done Investigators also said he had been watching violent Islamic State videos on his phone for monthsFriends and acquaintances said since he came to the United States Saipov worked intermittently as a truck driver and an Uber driver but some said he had a bad temper and lost driving jobs because of it When his neighbor Batista saw the Home Depot rental truck on his block Saipov was always driving and his two friends were passengers While he found Saipovs use of the truck odd he didnt stand out in other ways the neighbor said Batista thought of him generally as a calming influence in the neighborhood where he had lived for about half a year  One time when Batista was riding his dirt bike he got into an argument with two of Saipovs friends Saipov emerged from his house to break up the dispute He was the peacemaker Batista said I went on my wayBatista did not know the names of the two men Saipov was often seen withFBI officials have questioned Saipovs wife who has denied any knowledge of the planned violence according to a person familiar with the discussionThe person who spoke to his wife by phone Tuesday evening but did not want to be identified said she seemed shocked and horrified and scared and sad At the time federal agents were at her house encouraging her to cooperate to ensure no one else was harmedOther neighbors on the block of Genessee Avenue where Saipov lived said nothing struck them as unusual about the 29-year-old father of three young children Altana Dimitrovska a tenant who lived in the same small apartment complex said she was surprised by the news She used to see Saipov bringing one of his children to school in the mornings Speaking through a translator Dimitrovska said she once asked him if he ever went to work because she would see him on the sidewalk a lotHe said yeah I do go to work But I never saw him going to work she said Asked whether she ever saw anything suspicious about the man the 63-year-old neighbor replied No no noBefore he lived in Paterson Saipov and his family lived in an apartment in Tampa next to Kyong Eagan Eagan called Saipov shy soft-spoken very quietHe was a small guy only 100 pounds and 5 feet tall she said I could have punched and knocked him down I cant believe this small guy did this monstrous thing During the time Saipov and his family were her neighbors she said he was very generous to her He would give me a whole case of water from his truck Eagan said Sometimes he would give me a whole box of mango juice and never charged me Eagan said he also brought her home-cooked meals and said he wanted to share food from his country with her Eagan said that on most weekends about 30 men  young and old  gathered at Saipovs house to pray I just have to pinch myself over and over Eagan said Thats my neighbor Thats my neighbor This doesnt make sense to me He was a very polite man He offered me food and drinks He never said anything hateful about the country Hes a monster now  Eagan says Saipov lived in her apartment complex just over a year and left Tampa this past spring He said he left her a vacuum cleaner brooms a mop two printers and a computer and on March 8 according to her receipt she donated them to the Salvation ArmyHe was in a big hurry to move out of there Eagan said In Ohio where Saipov lived when he first immigrated to the United States one of his friends described a darker personality  one prone to fights and misunderstandingsEveryone in our neighborhood knew he was a little bit troubled said truck driver Mirrakhmat Muminov 38 living outside Akron Ohio He remembered Saipov once parked in a spot for handicapped drivers and that someone tried to make him move his carHe started yelling Is that your place Are you buying this place Why are you telling me where to park  Muminov said This aggressive behavior happened all the timeOn the job sometimes customers would get mad if he was late for a delivery and refuse to pay him He would raise his voice and say How can you not pay me  Muminov said The customers would call us to report the problem We would warn him a couple times You have to be nice to customers And then we fired himMuminov said that Saipov lived in the Cuyahoga Falls area which has an Uzbek immigrant community of several dozen refugees for about three years   Rosenberg reported from Paterson NJ Abigail Hauslohner in Paterson Jon Silman in Tampa and Julie Tate Jennifer Jenkins and Katie Mettler in Washington

over the years OReilly and Fox News have paid $13 million to five women to settle claims of sexual harassment or inappropriate conduct OReilly has long been a polarizing figure but his show

the most popular in cable news after its 2009 debutDespite his large following Becks polarizing commentaryfrightened off mainstream brands Mostmemorably Beck declared on the air that President Barack Obama was a racist who has a deep-seated hatred for white peopleSponsors didnt desert Beck all at once but eventually hundreds of companies refused to buy airtime during his showOReilly is a long long way from becoming a business liability on par with Beck But when advertisers start walking TV executives start paying attention The bottom-line reality is that lost revenue registers in a way that liberal outrage over something like say a  does notRep Maxine Waters (D-Calif) whose hair OReilly likened toa James Brown wig last week suggested on MSNBC Wednesday eveningthat the King of Cable News belongs behind bars along with others at Fox News which she accused of operating a sexual harassment enterpriseIt shouldnt be in America that you can sexually harass women and then buy your way out of it because youre rich she said If they continue to do this in the way that they have done they need to go to jailYet OReilly has proven that even questions about journalistic integrity can be shrugged off or spun to his advantage The Falklands episode two years ago centered on previous claims OReilly had made about his career as a reporter such as this one in his 2001 book Ive reported on the ground in active war zones from El Salvador to the FalklandsIn fact OReilly like almost all journalists who covered the Falklands War in 1982  never set foot on the Falkland Islands After Mother Jones published its report OReilly said he never meant to suggest he was on the islands and was referring to his on-the-ground coverage of postwar protests on the Argentine mainland in Buenos Aires He said that distinguishing between combat on the islands and faraway demonstrations in which soldiers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters amounted to splitting hairsSlates Justin Peters  why reporting by Mother Jones and subsequent coverage by the likes of Media Matters would not dent OReillyBeing accused of fabulism by liberal news outlets like Mother Jones and Media Matters doesnt harm OReillys credibility because OReillys credibility is dependent on exploiting a sense of victimization among his audience Much of the Fox News demographic is composed of people who feel that theyre under attack by unscrupulous liberals So when it appears that a host comes under attack by unscrupulous liberals that serves to reinforce their existing worldview The first thought isnt  Its OReillys viewers mightbe similarly galvanized now The King of Cable News enjoyed a  at the height of the Falklands scrutiny which only made his nightlyshow a more appealing forum on which to air commercials The Times citing data from Kantar Media that OReillys program hauled in $446 million in ad revenue from 2014 to 2016The continued success of The Factor depends on advertisers willingness to keep paying for access to OReillys viewers and a bunch are no longer willingAccusations of sexual harassment and million-dollar payouts to silence accusers have tarnished Bill OReillys image in the past week and caused dozens of companies to pull their ads from his show But if the ratings are any indication the man once dubbed the King of Cable News hasnt lost any of his loyal subjectsMore than 371 million people tuned into The OReilly Factor last week giving him a 12 percent bump from the viewership he attracted the week before and up a staggering 28 percent from the same week in 2016 the Nielsen company said Tuesday A New YorkTimes story said OReilly and 21st Century Fox had paid out a total of $13 million to five women who had filed harassment lawsuitsThe women who made allegations against Mr OReilly either worked for him or appeared on his show They have complained about a wide range of behavior including verbal abuse lewd comments unwanted advances and phone calls in which it sounded as if Mr OReilly was masturbating according to documents and interviewsThe reporting suggests a pattern As an influential figure in the newsroom Mr OReilly would create a bond with some women by offering advice and promising to help them professionally He then would pursue sexual relationships with them causing some to fear that if they rebuffed him their careers would stall  The National Organization for Women has  US Rep MaxineWaters (D-Calif)  OReilly stirred controversy earlier this month after he said the black legislators hair looks like a James Brown wig  told MSNBC that OReilly

President Trump I dont think Bill did anything wrongSaturday Night Live even poked fun at the presidents comments in a  Baldwins OReilly asked the fake Trump how familiar he was with the case to which Baldwin-as-Trump replied Im more familiar with this case than say health care but I really didnt look into it much noSince the accusations came out nearly 60companies have pulled their ads from The

strong a legacy its past two presidents really hadthe White Housewroteto CNN It called the younger Bushs decision to wage war on Iraq one of the greatest foreign policy mistakes in American historyNEW WH responds to Bush41 calling POTUS a blowhard Calls Iraq greatest foreign policy mistakes in American history via/   Ryan Nobles (@ryanobles) The books author Mark Updegroveinterviewed theBushes last year  long before Trumps inauguration  and found neither wanted to see what theydescribed as acoarse populist campaignerbecome presidentI dont like him George HWBush told Updegrovebefore the election according to the bookI dont know much about him but I know hes a blowhard And Im not too excited about him being [our] leaderA month earlier Trumphad famouslycited himself as his ownbest foreign policy adviser Because I have a very good brain and Ive said a lot of thingswho had no diplomatic or military experienceUpon learning this Updegrove wrote George W Bush thought to himself Wow this guy really doesnt understand the job of presidentThose comments came as Trump neared the Republican nomination for president having vanquished most other contenders including another member of the Bush family  whom Trump repeatedly mocked as George W Bush didnt expect Trump to win the general election Updegrove told CNN in  about his new bookWhen Trump started to rise I think he became concerned because he saw this populism ofDonald Trump getting in the way of Americas position in the world Updegrove saidAs he watched Trumps campaign theyounger Bushfeared he  Bush would be the last Republican president said the author who founded the National Medal of Honor Museum this year after several years as director of theLyndon Baines JohnsonPresidential Library and MuseumAnd it wasnt just about Hillary Clinton becoming presidenthe said It was because Donald Trump represented everything that the Bushes abhorredTrump stood for rudeness international isolationism and weak leadership in the eyes of the Bushes according toUpdegrove  reservations echoed by many establishment Republicans In September George W Bush gave ain which he didntmentionTrumpbut lamented these same vices  and politicsthat seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabricationBut Trump who has made  in less than a year and almost constantly insults his many rivalsdid win the presidency  It is rare in the modern political erato see former presidentsBut this is all different with Donald Trump presidential historian Douglas Brinkley saidIt allows us tounderstand how much a renegade Trump is in the Republican Party he said Trump represents the outsider and the Bush family are quintessential insidersThe Bushes have despised Trump for decadesBrinkley said citing reports that the elder Bush  in the 1992 electionTrumphad his turn in 2016 when he ridiculedJeb Bushout of the race and campaigned againstGeorge W Bushs decision to wage war in IraqNo Democrat has criticized the war in Iraq withas much anger as Donald Trump Brinkley said How can George W Bush resurrect his post-presidency career when the sittingpresident is telling everyone every day how awful he isSo the historian wasnt surprised to seeTrumps old campaign feuds embroil his White House in 2017 although he had to think back more than a half-century to cite a comparable example (President Harry S Truman once said soon-to-be-president Dwight D Eisenhowerknew no more about politics)  Andnot only did the Bush presidents lament the prospect of a Trump presidency in 2016  Updegrove wrote that they also shunnedtheir

real human suffering onourconstituents he said at a  as he fought Trumps effort to repeal his administrations health-care policiesTrump doesnt appear to be any chummier with former president Bill Clinton whose wife he defeated in the 2016 race Clinton and Trump werein a public spat as recently as December each accusing the other of general ignoranceOf all theformerpresidentstheone Trump once  the worst President in the history of the United Stateshas lately been kindest to himIn an interview with the New York Times  Jimmy Carteraccused the news media of being harder on Trump than any other president certainly that Ive known about He said ifthe United States had receded as a global leader under President Trump it hadalready been doing so for many yearsCarter even said hed offered his services to the Trump administrationBut as the Times wrote the ex-presidenthad harsher words for another successor Obama perhaps signaling one way or another the era of presidential friendlinessis overJerry Jones heard Greg Hardys comments about Gisele Bundchen being hot and playing his first game with the Dallas Cowboys with guns blazin and like the NFL he is looking the other wayJones was at first a little nonplussed when told about comments by Hardy who will play in his first NFL game since being suspended for a domestic incident allegedly involving the assault of an ex-girlfriend and a bed covered with firearms Hardy coming off a four-game suspension by the league over the matter praised the supermodel wife of quarterback Tom Brady in a tone-deaf way given his pastI love seeing Tom Brady Hardy said Hes cool as crap Have you seen his wife I hope she comes to the game I hope her sister comes to the game all her friends come to the gameHardy didnt stop there Told by a reporter that other quarterbacks like Blake Bortles are married to attractive women (such is the state of sports journalism these days) Hardy addedIs she [attractive] This kind of information is important Thats how I select my Pro BowlsJoness initial reaction at the NFL owners fall meeting was Oh my goodness Perhaps he should have stopped there but he didntWhen I saw him marry [Bundchen] Tom went up in my eyes 100 percent Jones said (via SIcom) Shes very very attractive and it shows what an outstanding individual Tom isOh brother Brady in a conference call was asked if Hardys remarks bothered himNo Im just getting ready to play man Ive got to focus on my job Hes a great player Weve got to  It takes a lot of different things to handle a guy like that But hes been a great player since hes been in the league so were going to have to prepare for him and be ready for all different types of moves that hes got Brady said But theyve got a good D-line anyway They count on getting pressure from their front four getting to the quarterback so I dont really care about his personal feelings(You know what means Hes going to throw for 7 trillion yards and 84 touchdowns Sunday)Hardys remarks about guns were surprising tooI hope I come out guns blazin Im full of excitement and full of juice Hardy said Im ready to go I have what they call fresh legs Im really excited to get out there on that grass or turf and see what they can doJones paused for a moment when asked about that then went the head-in-the-sand routeWell youre not allowed to have guns on the football field Jonessaid We all know thats just a way of expressing yourself I hope his guns are a-blazinCowboys Coach Jason Garrett circled the wagons in his defense of HardyTypically we try to keep things in house here with the Cowboys Greg is excited to be playing Sometimes things come out of your mouth when you are excited he said I think he has an understanding that it is more important to define yourself as a player more than anything else I think he will learn from those comments and the reaction to them I dont think it was anything  there was no bad intent by any means I think he is just excited to get back to playing footballNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell who struggled mightily and failed to get the issue of domestic violence right got this wrong too  perhaps because this is the man who unsuccessfully tried to suspend Brady for DeflateGate the same number of games as Hardy (whose suspension was reduced to four games)Im not aware of the comments Goodell said at a press conference showing that he is either blase about the matter or takes the counsel of no one at NFL headquarters So I cant respond to the comments because I havent seen them But we have high standards in the NFL and we expect people to follow them The vast majority of NFL players are outstanding young men They do great things in the community Im proud of what they doThe reaction nationally was one of incredulity Tony Kornheiser on Pardon the Interruption called for Hardy to be immediately suspended again  wrote Question for Jerry Jones and Jason Garrett How do you like that Greg Hardy now Sounds like the player you so magnanimously gave a second chance to is living down to his reputation  saw it reflecting badly on NFL leadership as well as HardyIf theres one man in professional sports who should be contrite its Hardy Clearly he doesnt have it in him This unrepentant and immature behavior by Hardy in his debut with the Dallas media reflects terribly not only on him but also on the Cowboys the NFLPA the NFL and everyone else who is supposed to be monitoring and guiding Hardy Is there no one who is counseling him Little over a year since the Rice elevator video what kind of leadership is thisWell its the kind that is solely focused on the product on the field and conveniently forgets everything that happened early in the 2014 seasonFormer Democratic National Committee head Donna Brazile writes in a new book that she seriously contemplated setting in motion a process to replace Hillary Clinton as the partys 2016 presidential nominee with then-Vice President Biden in the aftermath of Clintons fainting spell in part because Clintons campaign was anemic and had taken on the odor of failureIn an  Brazile details widespread dysfunction and dissension throughout the Democratic Party including secret deliberations over using her powers as interim DNC chair to initiate the process of removing Clinton and running mate Sen Tim Kaine (Va) from the ticket after Clintons Sept 11 2016 collapse in New York CityBrazile writes that she considered a dozen combinations to replace the nominees and settled on Biden and Sen Cory Booker (NJ) the duo she felt most certain would win over enough working-class voters to defeat Republican Donald Trump But then she writes I thought of Hillary and all the women in the country who were so proud of and excited about her I could not do this to themBrazile paints a scathing portrait of Clinton as a well-intentioned historic candidate whose campaign was badly mismanaged took minority constituencies for granted and made blunders with stiff and stupid messages The campaign was so lacking in passion for the candidate she writes that its New York headquarters felt like a sterile hospital ward where someone had diedBrazile alleges that Clintons top aides routinely disrespected her and put the DNC on a starvation diet depriving it of funding for voter turnout operationsAs one of her partys most prominent black strategists Brazile also recounts fiery disagreements with Clintons staffers  including a conference call in which she told three senior campaign officials Charlie Baker Marlon Marshall and Dennis Cheng that she was being treated like a slaveIm not Patsey the slave Brazile recalls telling them a reference to the character played by Lupita Nyongo in the film 12 Years a Slave Yall keep whipping me and whipping me and you never give me any money or any way to do my damn job I am not going to be your whipping girlCheng the campaigns national finance director did not participate in this call according to a senior Clinton campaign official  Braziles  titled Hacks The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House will be released Tuesday by Hachette Books A copy of the 288-page book was obtained in advance by The Washington PostFormer Clinton campaign officials stronglydisputed some details in Braziles account as well as heroverall characterization of the campaign and theydisparagedher memoir as an effort to sell books and manufacture dramaMore than 100 former senior aides Saturday night reading We do not recognize the campaign she portrays in the bookWe were shocked to learn the news that Donna Brazile actively considered overturning the will of the Democratic voters by attempting to replace Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine as the Democratic Presidential and Vice Presidential nominees the letterbegan It is particularly troubling andpuzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda spread by both the Russians and our opponent about our candidates healthPerhaps not since George Stephanopoulos wrote  a 1999 memoir of his years working for former president Bill Clinton has a political strategist penned such a blistering tell-allIn it Brazile reveals how fissures of race gender and age tore at the heart of the operation  even as Clinton was campaigning on a message of inclusiveness and trying to assemble a rainbow coalition under the banner of Stronger TogetherA veteran operative and television pundit who had long served as DNCs vice chair Brazile  in July 2016 for chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz The Florida congresswoman was ousted from the DNC on the eve of the party convention after WikiLeaks released stolen emails among her and her advisers that showed favoritism for Clinton during the primariesBrazile describes her mounting anxiety about Russias theft of emails and other data from DNC servers the slow process of discovering the full extent of the cyberattacks and the personal fallout She likens the feeling to having rats in your basement You take measures to get rid of them but knowing they are there or have been there means you never feel truly at peaceBrazile writes that she was haunted by the still-unsolved murder of DNC data staffer Seth Rich and feared for her own life shutting the blinds to her office window so snipers could not see her and installing surveillance cameras at her home  At first Brazile writes of the hacking top Democratic officials were encouraging us not to talk about it But she says a wake-up moment came when she visited the White House in August 2016 for President Obamas 55th birthday party National security adviser Susan E Rice and former attorney general Eric H Holder Jr separately pulled her aside to urge her to take the Russian hacking seriously which she did she writesThat fall Brazile says she tried to persuade her Republican counterparts to agree to a joint statement condemning Russian interference but that they ignored her messages and callsBackstage at a debate she writes she approached Sean Spicer then-chief strategist for the Republican National Committee but I could see his eyes dart away like this was the last thing he wanted to talk to me about She asked RNC Chairman Reince Priebus too but I got that special DC frost where the person smiles when he sees you but immediately looks past you trying to find someone in the room to come right over and interrupt the conversationThere would be no joint statementThe WikiLeaks releases included an email in which Brazile a paid CNN contributor at the time shared potential topics and questions for a CNN town hall in advance with the Clinton campaign She claims in her book that she did not recall sending the email and could not find it in her computer archives Nevertheless she eventually admitted to sending it believing her reputation would have suffered regardlessAt the Oct 19 debate in Las Vegas with the email scandal simmering the Clinton campaign sat Brazile not in the front row  where she had been at the previous debate  but in bleachers out of view of cameras She recalls watching the debate with the Rev Jesse Jackson among others whom they had to invite but wanted to tuck awayBrazile describes in wrenching detail Clintons bout with pneumonia On Sept 9 she saw the nominee backstage at a Manhattan gala and she seemed wobbly on her feet and had a rattled cough Brazile recommended Clinton see an acupuncturistTwo days later Clinton collapsed as she left a Sept 11 memorial service at Ground Zero in New York Brazile blasts the campaigns initial efforts to shroud details of her health as shamefulWhenever Brazile got frustrated with Clintons aides she writes she would remind them that the DNC charter empowered her to initiate the replacement of the nominee If a nominee became disabled she explains the party chair would oversee a complicated process of filling the vacancy that would include a meeting of the full DNCAfter Clintons fainting spell some Democratic insiders were abuzz with talk of replacing her  and Brazile says she was giving it considerable thoughtThe morning of Sept 12 Brazile got a call from Bidens chief of staff saying the vice president wanted to speak with her She recalls thinking Gee I wonder what he wanted to talk to me about Jeff Weaver campaign manager for Sen Bernie Sanders (I-Vt) called too to set up a call with his boss and former Maryland governor Martin OMalley sent her an emailBrazile also was paid a surprise visit in her DNC office by Baker who she writes was dispatched by the Clinton campaign to make sure that Donna didnt do anything crazyAgain and again I thought about Joe Biden Brazile writes But she adds No matter my doubts and my fears about the election and Hillary as a candidate I could not make good on that threat to replace herNeither Baker nor any othersenior campaign official wereaware thatBrazilehad any thoughts about or actively contemplatedchanging the ticket a senior Clinton campaign official said SaturdayCharlie may well have been there to talk her out of doing something crazy but it certainly was not about this said the officialwho spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matterBrazile writes that she inherited a national party in disarray in part because President Obama Clinton and Wasserman Schultz were three titanic egos who had stripped the party to a shell for their own purposesBrazile writes that she inherited Wasserman Schultzs office  with tropical pink walls that she found hard on the eyes  and ridiculous perks such as a Chevrolet Tahoe with driver and a personal entourage that included an assistant known as a body womanIn her first few days on the job Brazile writes that she also discovered the DNC was $2 million in debt and that the payroll was stacked with hangers-on and sycophants For instance Wasserman Schultz kept two consulting firms  SKDKnickerbocker and Precision Strategies  each on $25000-a-month retainers and one of Obamas pollsters was still being paid $180000 a yearThe outgoing president no longer needed to assess his approval ratings or his policy decisions at least not when the Democratic Party was fighting for its survival against a hostile foreign power she writes JenOMalley-Dillon a partner at Precision Strategies defended her firms work fortheDNC We worked hard to get the partys technologyinfrastructure and ground operations in shape for thegeneral election regardless of the nominee she wrote Saturdayin an email There was no gravy train and we are proud of our work Brazile also details how Clinton effectively took control of the DNC in August 2015 before the primaries began with a joint fundraising agreement between the party and the Clinton campaignShe said the deal gave Clinton control over the DNCs finances strategy and staff decisions  disadvantaging other candidates including Sanders This was not a criminal act but as I saw it it compromised the partys integrity she writesAn excerpt of this chapter  titled Bernie I Found the Cancer  was  sparking discord and recriminations through the partyAs she traveled the country Brazile writes she detected an alarming lack of enthusiasm for Clinton On black radio stations few people defended the nominee In Hispanic neighborhoods the only Clinton signs she saw were at the campaign field officesBut at headquarters in New York the mood was one of self-satisfaction and inevitability and Braziles early reports of trouble were dismissed with a condescending toneBrazile describes the 10th floor of Clintons Brooklyn headquarters where senior staff worked Calm and antiseptic like a hospital It had that techno-hush as if someone had died I felt like I should whisper Everybodys fingers were on their keyboards and no one was looking at anyone else You half-expected to see someone in a lab coat walk byDuring one visit she writes she thought of a question former Democratic congressman Tony Coelho used to ask her about campaigns Are the kids having sex Are they having fun If not lets create something to get that going or otherwise were not going to winI didnt sense much fun or [having sex] in Brooklyn she deadpansBrazile writes that Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook and his lieutenants were so obsessed with voter data and predictive analytics that they missed the big pictureThey knew how to size up voters not by meeting them and finding out what they cared about what moved their hearts and stirred their souls but by analyzing their habits she writes You might be able to persuade a handful of  magazine readers who drink gin and tonics to change their vote to Hillary but you had not necessarily made them enthusiastic enough to want to get up off the couch and go to the pollsBrazile describes Mook in his mid-30s as overseeing a patriarchy They were all men in his inner circle she writes adding He had this habit of nodding when you are talking leaving you with the impression that he has listened to you but then never seeming to follow up on what you thought you had agreed onMany of Clintons senior staff were women including Mooks chief of staff as well as campaign co-chair Huma AbedinBraziles criticisms were not reserved for Mook After Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri challenged Braziles plan for Kaine to deliver a pep talk to DNC staff at the party convention in Philadelphia Brazile writes I was thinking Palmieri on Saturday disputed Braziles account tweeting Sad to learn she feels this way about me Dont recall request she refers toBrazile writes with particular disdain about Brandon Davis a Mook protege who worked as a liaison between the DNC and the Clinton campaign She describes him as a spy saying he treated her like a crazy senile old auntie and couldnt wait to tell all his friends the nutty things she saidIn staff meetings Brazile recalls Brandon often rolled his eyes as if I was the stupidest woman hed ever had to endure on his climb to the topBrazile opens her book by describing the painful days following Clintons defeat She received calls of gratitude from party leaders but still felt slightedI never heard from Hillary she writes I knew what I wanted to say to her and it was  But in the weeks after the loss every time I checked my phone thinking I might have missed her call it wasnt herFinally in February 2017 Clinton rangThis was chitchat like I was talking to someone I didnt know Brazile writes I know Hillary I know she was being as sincere as possible but I wanted something more from herFormerDemocratic National Committee interim chair Donna Brazile said Sunday that despite a joint fundraising agreement between the DNC andHillary Clintons campaign there wasno evidence that the 2016 presidential primaries were rigged whileher successor Tom Perez said the DNC is workingto earnbackthe trust of votersThe comments came asBrazile details the fundraising agreement in

wererun by states Perezpointed out that in many of the caucuses which were run by the party Sanders bested ClintonNevertheless he said We have to earn the trust of the voters and during the process of the Democratic primary we fell short of that undeniablyWhen I hear the word rigged lets be very clear Hillary Clinton won the Democratic primary by 4 million votes The Democratic National Committee does not run elections for primaries  States run elections and those elections were run by the states We run caucuses and Bernie Sanders did very well in the caucusesHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) had a similar reactionwhen asked onCNNs State of the Union whether she thought the primaries were riggedEveryone goes back to re-litigate elections when you lose Pelosi said Everybody has a version and maybe all of it have an element of truth But I think what we need to do is go forwardIn her ABC interview Brazile also explained her secret deliberations about whether to initiate a complicated DNC process to replace Clinton as the nominee after her Brazile writes in her book Hacks that she had settled on Vice President Joe Biden as the best replacement and had serious doubts during that period about the direction of Clintons campaignbut didnot initiate the process As party chair she did not have the power to unilaterally replace the nomineeI was under tremendous pressure after Secretary Clinton fainted to have a Plan B  Brazile said on ABC I didnt want a Plan B Plan A was great for me I supported Hillary and I wanted her to win But we were under pressureBrazile said she kept her own counsel during this period and did not talk about it withBidenThis was something you play out in your mindshe saidBraziles book is a savagememoir of her experiences withClintons campaign which she describes as mismanaged and lacking in passion  On Saturday night after The Washington Post on some of Braziles allegations and characterizations more than 100 Clinton staffers signed an  disputing the former party chairs accountWe do not recognize the campaign she portrays inthe book the letter readThe letter also read We were shocked to learn the news that Donna Brazile actively considered overturning the will of the Democratic voters by attempting to replace Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine as the Democratic Presidential and Vice Presidential nominees It is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda spread by both the Russians and our opponent about our candidates healthPerez said in his Sunday interview on NBC The charge that Hillary Clinton was somehow incapacitated is quite frankly ludicrous Hillary Clinton was a tireless senator a tireless secretary of state and a tireless candidateBrazile said she had no regrets penning a tell-all and when Stephanopoulos questioned whether her account is helpful to the Democratic Party she took umbrageGeorge for those who are telling me to shut up they told Hillary that a couple of months ago Brazile said referring to the release of Clintons memoir You know what I tell them Go to hell Im going to tell my story  And I say go to hell because why am I supposed to be the only person that is unable to tell my storySen Bob Corker was on his way to the Senate chamber for a vote drinking coffee from a foam cup  and resolutely mum when asked about President Trumps upcoming trip to Asia his tax-reform strategy and what the Tennessee Republican meant when he called the White House an adult day-care center I have no desire to enter into you know 24/7 you know disagreement Corker explained in a brief interview When I have strong disagreements Im going to express them stronglyCorker seized the role of presidential critic in chief last month when he  in a rapid-fire series of conversations with reporters of debasing the country with his untruths and name-calling If he could do it all over he added he would not have supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election It was a deeply personal and seemingly calculated fusillade  and the culmination of an uneven year in which Corker tried to partner with a new Republican White House but ultimately couldnt resist the urge to very publicly walk awayThe two things he cannot stand said Corkers longtime chief of staff Todd Womack are bullies and people who do not tell the truthNow Corker has his party on edge wondering where and when he will strike again and what it will mean  for the fragile GOP alliance for the partys languishing agenda and for Corker himself as he gears up for a final year in the Senate before retirementI worry about what it does to his ability to be effective with the White House with his peers said Tom Ingram Corkers longtime friend and former political strategist No one not even Corker seems sure where this one will lead Asked whether key moments changed his thinking about Trump Corker demurred  promising to explain it all eventually but not yetThe answer to that is very specifically absolutely yes he said But I dont want to rehash those right now I will at some point probably Interviews with Corkers associates friends colleagues and aides revealed some of those turning points including concern over the summer about Trumps fiscal ideas and later Trumps controversial assessment of the deadly violence in Charlottesville These associates also explained that Corkers frustration built over time and that his outbursts of frustration combined impulse circumstance and the kind of gut-level decision-making that has guided a lifetime of unconventional choices   Unlike Sen Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) who has harshly and consistently criticized Trump since the 2016 campaign Corker slowly lost faith both with the presidents disposition as a leader and with the policies his White House was pursuing A construction tycoon Corker forged an early bond with Trump over their shared business backgrounds His name surfaced as a potential running mate and later for secretary of state He used such words as incredible and excited and positive to  They played golf and talked on the phoneAs chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee Corker became known for an affable role giving the president foreign-policy advice According to Ingram Corker had felt some disappointment that he wasnt tapped for a high-level administration post But he moved on pretty quicklyEvidence of strain emerged over the spring and summer After the revelation in May that Trump had disclosed classified information to Russias foreign minister and ambassador Corker  that the White House was in a downward spiral A couple of months later Corker voiced private concern with his own political strategists that Trump was not doing enough to curb federal spending according to two people familiar with the conversationsAnd just days after Trump stoked controversy in blaming both sides for what happened at a deadly white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville Corker  Aug 17 that Trump had not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needed to demonstrate in order to be successfulBut it wasnt just the Charlottesville comments that troubled Corker people close to him said Other controversial actions Trump had taken also weighed on his mind The setting that day also contributed to his decision to speak out He was asked about Trump by reporters at the Rotary Club in his home town of Chattanooga where he had served as mayor He wanted to be upfront with the folks back home Corker was also struck with the growing realization that what concerned him about Trump was not getting better associates said He had talked to Trump over dinners and other private chats He had expressed his worries to confidants in less public settings His hope had been that Trump would change his ways That didnt happenOn Sept 26 Corker  His decision came as a surprise even to some people in his inner circle He had been preparing for a campaign  traveling back home raising money Womack said two days shaped Corkers decision more than any others One was an economic development announcement on Aug 24 in Middle Tennessee While sitting on stage and looking at the audience he reflected on his time in the Senate and felt a sense of completion This is where he knew in his heart it was time to step down Womack said The second was at a fundraiser in Washington the night before the announcement where he voiced pessimism about the Republican legislative agenda He knew in his head that moment Womack said that it was time to bow out Others in Corkers orbit believe the prospect of a difficult Republican primary also weighed on the senators mind  a primary that grew likelier as his feud with Trump escalatedTrump has fueled the conflict too He has disparaged the 5-foot 7-inch senator as Liddle Bob Corker on Twitter and  an ineffective senator Trumps  and criticism of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also bothered Corker On Oct 4 Corker told reporters I think sometimes people stay in incredibly frustrating positions like that because they feel like they know what it is that theyre  you know  the kind of policies that they are putting in place For Corker impulses and uncertainty have governed a lifetime of audacious moves According to associates he has always gone his own way eschewed advice and taken risks  without always knowing how things will end There was the time he joined his high school football team as a defensive backI was 56 and 140 pounds and at a rivalry game a very large running back  probably 200 pounds  was coming down the sideline at me full speed Corker once told  I caught him square in the chest and drove him backwards I remember Coach Davis grabbing me by the back of my pants in excitement after the play I was proud because I had executed it in the exact way I had been taughtDecades later Corker broke with party leaders to join Democrats in the Dodd-Frank financial regulation talks during Barack Obamas presidency only to be left empty-handed at the conclusion  Some Republicans have been relieved that Corker has stayed largely silent since he went off on the president Oct 24 He had chosen to speak out at a moment when Republicans were supposed to be fostering unity and cohesion not deepening fissures That very day Trump was in the Capitol to visit with Senate Republicans and gin up support for the tax overhaul Theres a biblical concept of Matthew Chapter 18  when you have a dispute with somebody you go to them face to face and be able to work it out said Sen James Lankford (R-Okla) on the day of Corkers criticism And its still not a bad practice no matter where you areMost Republican senators have avoided public comment on the Trump-Corker fight Privately some have encouraged peace Weve all visited said Sen Mike Rounds (R-SD) when asked if he has spoken to either Corker or Flake who announced his own retirement with a long rebuke of the president on the same day that Corker spoke out And we all understand some of their frustrations Thats part of it Look these are two good people But Donald Trump is the president of the United States And for the good of this entire country we want him to be successfulOn his way to the Senate vote last week Corker said he had not spoken to the president since his denunciation the week before Womack attributed Corkers desire not to revisit his criticism of Trump as part of his goal of being productive and focusing on policy Soon however Corker and Trump would be at odds again A day later on Friday Corker fired off a statement criticizing Trump for demanding that the Justice Department and FBI target Democrats and for calling for the death penalty for the suspect in the New York City terrorist attackIn a speechintended to galvanize Arab andMuslim leaders against threats from extremists and Iran President Trump demanded unity from his audience in Saudi Arabia and focusOne goal transcends every other consideration he said to the assembled leaders in the Saudi capital in an address that shifted between stark realism and startling optimism We pray this special gathering may someday be remembered as the beginning of peace in the Middle East he saidBut instead of peace the Middle East was battered by a wave of conflict in the days that followed awash with recriminations and repression that suggested that far from uniting the region Trumps words had only aggravated its dividesQatar and Saudi Arabia launched a bizarre and unexpected war of words that highlighted their longtime competition for regional influence and their often sharply contrasting visionsAs that dispute raged last week the leaders of  and Egypt embarked on unusually vicious crackdowns on political opponents at homekilling five people and arresting hundredsAnd leaders in Iran Saudi Arabias principal rival where voters earlier this month  went on the offensive condemning Trumps announcement of billions of dollars in  while revealing the existence of an underground ballistic missile facilityAnalysts said the tensions were almost surely a consequence of Trumps visit to Riyadh a forceful American endorsement of Saudi leadership in the Arab world punctuated by the weapons sales which had stirred panic and anxiety among the kingdoms competitors and enemies while emboldening its loyal and authoritarian alliesAnd Trumps appeal for a common stand against terrorism was unlikely to heal the rifts analysts said It was delivered to an audience of Arab leaders who have applied the term so broadly and casually  to violent militants as well as anti-government bloggers  as to render the word almost meaninglessDonald Trump now accepts the view of Saudi Arabia as a strategic bastion in the Arab and Islamic World said Fawaz Gerges a professor of Middle East studies at the London School of Economics And his visit was related to the tumult that ensued Gerges saidWhat you are seeing now is that the Saudi-led coalition feels empowered They are on the offensive Its a new era Everyone has to toe the line and join this alliance he said  The consequences of the shift could trouble the region for years he said by intensifying proxy wars in Yemen or Syria where Saudi Arabia and Iran have supported opposing sides Gerges saidNew fronts also could ignite  between Israel and Hezbollah Irans ally in places like southern LebanonAll sides are preparing for the next round Gerges saidIranian officials initially shrugged off Trumps vociferous anti-Iran comments in Riyadh dismissing the summit as spectacle Irans Internet-savvy foreign minister Javad Zarif ridiculed the US-Saudi arms deal on TwitterBut in the days since the Iranian government has adopted a more defiant tone denouncing  against Shiite-led opposition activists as a direct consequence of Trumps visitOn Thursday Iran unveiled the countrys third underground ballistic missile facility Its ongoing missile production has been a source of contention between Iran and the United StatesUS officials should know that whenever we need a missile test for technical reasons we will test it and we will not wait for their permission Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said at a news conference in Tehran on TuesdayIt was a departure from the conciliatory tone Rouhani took on the campaign trail and came as a senior military aide to Irans supreme leader also condemned the weapons deal as an attempt to destabilize the regionAs the Arab world braced for an escalating confrontation between Saudi Arabia and Iran another fight broke out last week between Saudi Arabia and Qatar whose long-standing rivalry has flared repeatedly since the Arab uprisings in 2011The genesis of the feud was a report published on the website of Qatars state news agency on Wednesday It quoted Qatars emir as criticizing the messages that had emerged from the Riyadh conference including the attacks by Trump and others on Iran and condemnations of Hamas and Hezbollah the Palestinian and Lebanese militant groupsQatar later said that the emir had never spoken and that the state news agency had been hackedThat did not prevent Saudi Arabia from launching days of scathing attacks on Qatar through Saudi media channels which suggested it would not tolerate any divergence from the Saudi-led positionIn a column titled Who runs Qatar a Saudi columnist Said al-Suraihi writing on the al-Arabiya news site said Qatar had disengaged itself from the consensus on issues that represent a common danger to the entire regionTrumps visit  which included what was widely seen as a pledge not to lecture the region on human rights abuses  also raised fears about stepped-up domestic repression in Saudi Arabia and the countries in its orbit including Bahrain the United Arab Emirates and Egypt Violence last week in Bahrain highlighted those concerns The tiny island nation  a Saudi ally and a close partner of the United States  has faced criticism for the governments repression of dissent and accusations of systemic discrimination against Bahrains Shiite majorityTrump met with Bahrains king in Riyadh last week and promised their relationship would be free of the strain of previous years  a reference to the Obama administrations periodic scolding of Bahrain for rights abuses  On Tuesday two days after the meeting forces in Bahrain raided an opposition sit-in outside the house of Bahrains most revered Shiite cleric killing five people in the deadliest confrontation with its opponents since a pro-democracy uprising on the island in 2011On the same day in Egypt the government of President Abdel-Fatah al-Sissi arrested one of the countrys most prominent opposition lawyers and a likely challenger to Sissi in elections that will be held next yearSissi  who had appeared in a widely circulated picture alongside Trump and the Saudi king during the meeting in Riyadh palming a glowing orb in a newly minted counterterrorism center  has received political support as well as billions of dollars in aid from the Saudis over the last few yearsKhalid Ali the lawyer who was arrested had played a prominent role in the legal effort to block a plan by the government to transfer sovereignty of two islands in the Red Sea from Egypt to Saudi ArabiaIt was not clear whether the arrest was related to the Saudi conference Dozens of people have been detained in Egypt in recent weeks including leftist and liberal government opponents as well as workers and trade unionists according to Gamal Eid an Egyptian human rights advocateThe authorities also blocked at least 21 news websites this week including Qatar-based outlets as well as Mada Masr a news portal that it is widely seen as Egypts last remaining independent publicationThe crackdown was not new Eid said but after the meeting in Riyadh  and Trumps green light the campaign of arrests and censorship was growing fast he said           Heba Farouk Mahfouz in Cairo contributed to this reportThe  the vast hardware and software system the Chinese government uses to prevent access to certain Internet content is often depicted as monolithic and Orwellian uses new and reveals serious cracks Although extensive the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) system of control over online social interaction is quite diffuse  and at times incoherent New moves by Beijing however may be in line to shore up the FirewallOur analysis found many inconsistencies in government  or faking grass-roots comments on news sites and social media Using metadata from a database of more than50 million posts on Chinese news websites we identified government astroturfers (known colloquially as the )  Chinese astroturfing work is highly decentralized and erratic and the fake posts are often at odds with the expressed preferences of the central government This is most likely a reflection of the   across different bureaucracies and regionsOur research on what gets deleted shows similar inconsistencies Chinas Firewall relies on censors to delete content that suggests collective action against the government  protests strikes petitions  or taunts to the leadershipGovernment censors do not uniformly and exclusively target collective action  Censors target political humor almost as frequently Posts depicting President Xi Jinping as  or his  are heavily censored for instanceHeres a closer look at how information control in China works  or not holds that astroturfing is about strategic distraction through cheerleading for the state But the Chinese governments expressed intent is guiding the formation of opinions changing minds through manipulation of available information instruct paid commentators in China to hog the seats on the Internet sofa by bombarding social media with pro-government messages By quickly diluting negative attitudes online and spreading positive energy () government commentators can guide public opinion as it develops  flood the comment section  and tirelessly grasp for the right to speak  How does this work in practice At the Group of 20 meeting in September 2016 President Xi Jinping misread his teleprompter telling people to  instead of lighten the burden of farmers Government censors deleted online news references to the flubAt the same meeting Xis wife drew favorable attention for her outfit a traditional dress that emphasized her good figure These comments also disappeared Astroturfers quickly filled the comment sections to G-20 news stories with sofa posts such as I support Xi Jinping Under his leadership China will become stronger and strongerThese comments take the first seats on the Internet sofa pushing down negative comments such asthe teleprompter mistake In a sea of upvoted highly visible fawning posts negative comments are diluted until the censors can delete them  These positive energy comments especially when posted early and often may discourage those with antigovernment opinions from voicing their complaints  or reassess their position once the astroturfed commentary appearsWe found examples where censors in one agency were deleting content identical to content produced by astroturfersAfter the June 2016 concluded in favor of the Philippines Chinas censors worked overtime to dampen protests from nationalistic  The censors targets werent surprising international pro-ruling and  However most of the censored posts were from ultranationalists advocating war with the United States or the PhilippinesBut some astroturfers used racist offensive language to demean the Philippines and the United States  whom they blamed for meddling in the South China Sea Instead of de-escalating per government instructions astroturfers posted the same vitriolic messages that were heavily censored on Sina Weibo such as Its no use arguing with jackals its more effective to hunt them down with a rifle and Dispatch warships  Provoke the enemy Open-fire when the Americans come Others called Filipinos misbehaving monkeysThis astroturfing behavior is not consistent with  findings which reported a predominance of cheerleading comments in Chinese astroturfing Our data show only 36 percent of comments related to The Hague ruling were cheerleading Aside from cheerleading posts more than50 percent of the astroturfed commentary argued for war or included racial slurs about Filipino people insults of other netizens or rage over the rulingCensorship and astroturfing are part of a broader information control strategy Government opinion management manuals suggest that the same employees responsible for astroturfing also compile information on public opinion during collective action events  and use this to revise contingency plans for future public opinion emergenciesWhat happened online after the August 2015 explosions at a Tianjin warehouse show how Beijing manages a public opinion emergency These explosions killed 173 people decimated a large area of Tianjins port and displaced nearly 3500 residentsThis was Chinas  Its likely the government had in place a contingency plan with instructions on how to diffuse threatening or antigovernment opinionCensors aimed to   to limit the spread of information calling attention to government malfeasance and health concerns As shown in Figure 1 astroturfers vigorously posted comments that contrasted with angry and indignant netizens who blamed the explosion on lax enforcement Astroturfers reframed the conversations to highlight emotions of sadness pride and unity to eulogize firefightersIn the Tianjin crisis the quick and unified online response suggests a great deal of government planning coordination and iterative updating of information strategies But the response to the South China Sea ruling points to a lack of preparation and coordination  and perhaps even disagreement between different parts of the governmentOur findings suggest that information control in China is more varied and decentralized than we thought as a Washington Post  also argued Chinas ability to control information is impressive but decentralization makes the system hard to tightly control For example althoughthe surveillance powers granted by Chinas recently issued  are formidable its implementation has been far from disciplined A  details how private data obtained using these new powers is being openly sold on the market perhaps by rogue government officialsThese moves suggest that Beijing is taking new steps to solidify control over the Web  and making sure whats out there on the Internet are the messages that the CCP wants Chinas citizens to readChinas direction is clear Beijings goal is what  researchers Mirjam Meissner and Jost Wbbeke call  a tighter strategy of mass surveillance and individual targeting that aims not only to guide discourse online but to leverage it for more effective governance propaganda and political controlHeather Heyer was killed

Scroll away and Ill meet you on the other sideYou made it Back in 1940 the 1040 form had  -- pretty manageable even with the small type Butyoud have to wade through  to fully understand the 2013 formThese numbers stand as a pretty good proxy for the growing complexity of the federal tax code over the past 60 years Filling up those hundreds of pages today are instructions for dealing with the byzantine tangle of credits deductions and tax scenarios that Congress has built into tax law over the years Many of these provisions  and a number of others -- like the gambling loss deduction -- are flat-out indefensibleThis complexity would be laughable if it didnt directly impact the lives ofevery man woman and child in America every single year Congress has flirted with major overhauls to the tax code for years now but it continually gets hung up on intractable partisan differences Maybe this year will be the year for reform thoughDont hold your breathPresident Trump escalated a war of words with North Korea on Friday calling Kim Jong Un a madman who would be tested like never before the latest in a potentially dangerous exchange of threats that included the North Korean leader calling Trump derangedThe playground-level taunts marked a sudden and potentially alarming turn toward personal enmity between the two leaders who are still taking one anothers measure The insults capped a week in which Trump threatened to obliterate the impoverished but nuclear-armed nation to protect the United States and its allies he also announced sweeping new US financial sanctionsDiplomats fretted that Trump was making a bad situation worse by threatening military action North Korea said it is considering how to respond and suggested Friday that it may soon test a hydrogen bomb over the PacificThe latest exchange began late Thursday when Kim called Trump a mentally deranged US dotard and referred to Trumps speech at the United Nations on Tuesday as unprecedented rude nonsenseName-calling is standard procedure for North Korea but the kind of direct statement issued in Kims name Thursday night is unusualTrump responded early Friday via TwitterKim Jong Un of North Korea who is obviously a madman who doesnt mind starving or killing his people will be tested like never before the president tweetedTrump returned to the theme later Friday saying at a political rally in Alabama that Rocket Man should have been handled a long time agoI want to tell you something and Im sure hes listening because he watches every word Hes watching us like he never watched anybody before And maybe something gets worked out and maybe it doesnt Personally Im not sure it will Trump said But Ill tell you one thing You are protectedThe Trump administration said last week that Trump is merely using the kind of blunt language that the isolated North Korean leader understands But officials acknowledge that they know little about how Kim perceives the worldAsian diplomats have warned the United States that the risk is particularly acute if Kim feels he is losing respect with the North Korean military and government elitePentagon leaders also worry that in the current charged environment either leader or his military might misinterpret the others intentions So far the White House has pursued a sometimes confusing three-part strategy of tougher economic sanctions military threats and an offer of negotiationsWe dont know how their means of communication and behavior will be Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Wednesday How the decision-maker or the people that are closer to the decision-maker are going to behave is something we will have to understand and learnTrump declared Tuesday while addressing the UN General Assembly that the United States has great strength and patience but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies we will have no choice but to totally destroy North KoreaNorth Koreas official Korean Central News Agency on Friday referred to Trumps speech as rubbish This thrice-cursed sophism made by the mentally deranged hooligan has shocked the whole world the news agency saidThe exchange of insults came as China on Friday disputed Trumps claim that it has joined a new round of punishing economic sanctions against its communist allyUnveiling the penalties Thursday Trump said that Chinese President Xi Jinping had ordered Chinese banks to cease conducting business with North Korean entities He welcomed the move as very bold and somewhat unexpectedBut on Friday Chinas Foreign Ministry spokesman denied that Beijing had agreed to go that farAs far as I know what you have mentioned just now is not consistent with the facts spokesman Lu Kang said at a regular news conference in response to a question about Trumps comments  Rising tension and the threat of a new war on the Korean Peninsula shaped Trumps four days of diplomatic discussions at the United Nations He met with the leaders of Japan and South Korea  US allies directly threatened by North Korea  and mocked Kim as Rocket Man on a suicide mission before announcing sweeping new US financial sanctionsKim did not attend the session and neither did Xi or Russian President Vladimir Putin whose nation also does business with North KoreaRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned the gathering Thursday of a very dangerous confrontation spiralWe resolutely condemn the nuclear missile adventures of Pyongyang in violation of Security Council resolutions But military hysteria is not just an impasse its disasterTrump also said diplomacy can still work to avert a crisis and US officials scurried to tell allies that Trump is not itching for warWhen asked Friday whether the presidents tweets were working to avert war Tillerson highlighted the US diplomatic efforts to address the North Korea situationThe president obviously takes the responsibility of the security of the American people very seriously and it is his first and foremost responsibility Tillerson said on ABCs Good Morning AmericaWe will continue our efforts in the diplomatic arena but all of our military options  as the president has said  are on the table he addedThe White House said Friday that Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in who met Thursday shared the view that maintaining overwhelming military superiority over North Korea is essential  China has tightened the financial screws on North Korea under UN sanctions approved in recent weeks But Beijing remains unwilling to completely isolate the regime and has not cut all financial tiesGiven that China accounts for nearly 90percent of North Koreas trade Beijings cooperation is vital to Trumps  to isolate and pressure PyongyangThe  Trump issued Thursday imposes sanctions on any foreign financial institution that knowingly conducts or facilitates any significant transaction in connection with trade with North Korea It also bans aircraft and ships from entering the United States if they have traveled to North Korea in the preceding 180 daysAt Fridays Chinese Foreign Ministry briefing Lu repeated Beijings familiar talking points that China comprehensively and strictly implements UN resolutions but opposes unilateral sanctions imposed outside the UN frameworkChinas stance on this is clear and consistent he saidLu declined to comment on the personalized exchange between Trump and KimHe also again appealed for calmWhats needed now is to implement the UN resolutions strictly and positively explore channels to solve problems via talks rather than provoking each other and adding oil to the fire Lu said Denyer reported from Beijing Anna Fifield in Tokyo Shirley Feng Luna Lin and Liu Yang in Beijing and Abby Phillip in Huntsville Ala contributed to this reportThe view from China could hardly be much worse the leaders of North Korea and the United States threatening to rain down total destruction on each other while US bombers and fighters stage a show of military might close to Chinas shoresIn public Chinas foreign ministry has calmly advocated for restraint and warned Pyongyang and Washington not add to fuel to the fire But behind closed doors experts said Sunday Beijing is as frustrated with North Korea and with the situation as it has ever beenAs North Koreas dominant trading partner China is widely seen as the key to solving the crisis yet experts say its influence over Pyongyang has never been weakerUnwilling to completely pull the plug it has nevertheless agreed to a stiff package of sanctions at the United Nations and implemented them with unprecedented determination experts saySo far all that has achieved is to alienate its neighbor and erstwhile friendThe North Koreans have figured out that the Chinese are genuinely in a bind said Euan Graham director of the International Security Program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney Having cried wolf for so long about having limited influence the Chinese genuinely do have limited influence in North Korea right now Its not just weasel wordsThe key step that China hesitates to take is cutting off crude oil exports to North Korea On Saturday China announced that it would limit exports of refined petroleum products and ban exports of condensates and liquefied natural gas to comply with the latest UN sanctions It will also ban imports of textiles from North KoreaBut China is not prepared to do anything that might bring down the North Korean regime potentially bringing refugees streaming across its border and unifying the Korean Peninsula under a US-friendly governmentNorth Koreas leaders experts in brinkmanship know that full well and this knowledge has allowed them to call Chinas bluff repeatedlyBut just in case they are also thought to have stockpiled between six and nine months of oil supplies  enough to keep the military and key industries going for some time Graham saidOn Saturday North Koreas foreign minister  that a strike against the US mainland is inevitable because President Trump mocked leader Kim Jong Un with the nickname Little Rocket ManIn response to Ri Yong Hos threats at the United Nations Trump If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man they wont be around much longerUS bombers escorted by fighter jets flew off the North Korean coast in a show of force on Saturday while in Pyongyang tens of thousands of people staged a mass rally

sure said Lu Chao a Korean Peninsula expert at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences in Shenyang China Although there is no imminent sign of an outbreak of war partial conflicts especially between the South and North Korea on the sea where boundaries are not set are very likely to occurNext month Chinas Communist Party leadership is to meet for a key congress during which President Xi Jinping is due to be confirmed for another five-year term as Communist Party general secretaryAt home and abroad there has been a big effort to project confidence and control and to ensure calmness and stability in the run-up to this meeting That effort has been felt in every arm and at every level of government here But Pyongyang simply isnt listeningIts sixth and most recent nuclear test was staged this month at a time when Xi was hosting leaders from BRICS (Brazil Russia India China South Africa) nations at a key summit  an insult that the face-conscious Chinese would have felt deeplyXi has never met Kim and the two men are thought to hold each other in contempt Chinas attempts to send an envoy to Pyongyang to calm the situation have been rebuffedSome experts say Beijing has only itself to blame  for helping North Korea in the past and allegedly enabling the regime to develop its missile program Yet there is no doubt it is now paying a priceChina has watched in alarm and anger this year as South Korea installed an American missile defense system that Beijing fears could be used to spy on Chinese territory It will also not have welcomed US warplanes flying close to its shores this weekendSouth Koreas presidential office said Seoul and Washington had coordinated closely over the deployment of the US bombers calling it one of the most effective countermeasures against the advancement of North Koreas nuclear and missile programs South Korean news media reportedWhile Seoul cooperates with Washington Pyongyang is freezing out BeijingOn Saturday KCNA issued a list of diplomatic missions that had held celebrations this month to mark the 69th anniversary of North Koreas founding The list included 17 nations  but pointedly not ChinaThe deterioration in relations between Beijing and Pyongyang erupted much more forcefully into the open Friday when KCNA angrily rebuked its Chinese state media counterparts for threatening insulting and undermining their country In a piece entitled Rude Deed of Shameless Media it took aim at the Chinese Communist Party newspaper the Peoples Daily for arguing in favor of sanctionsThe party organ of the socialist country bragging long history denounced socialist Korea so maliciously in collusion with the imperialists KCNA wroteIn China experts said North Korea has resolved to continue development of its nuclear and missile program  at least until it can put a nuclear warhead on a missile capable of reaching the United States  despite whatever external pressure is appliedSanctions in my view will not reverse North Koreas resolute determination said Shen Dingli deputy dean of Fudan Universitys Institute of International Studies in ShanghaiBut Lu at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences insisted that sanctions would work  at least by encouraging North Korea to one day return to talksThe sanctions that have been imposed will have a significant impact on North Koreas economy making them reconsider benefits and losses and choose between being an enemy of the international community or sitting back at the negotiating table he saidI believe that one day North Korea will be at the table  Shirley Feng contributed to this reportChinas Communist Party formally elevated President Xi Jinping to the same status as party legends Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping on Tuesday writing his name into its constitution and setting up the nations leader for an extended stay in powerThe move will make Xi the most powerful Chinese leader in decades with ambitions to tighten party control over society and make his country a superpower on the world stage with a political philosophy directly opposed to that of the West  The unanimous vote to enshrine Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics in a New Era in the constitution came on the final day of a week-long party congress a gathering of the party elite held every five years in the imposing and cavernous Great Hall of the People on the western side of Beijings Tiananmen SquareThere is no  of pithy quotations as there was under Mao but instead a mightier drier tome of Xis speeches on  Nevertheless his ideas will now become compulsory learning for Chinese students from primary school throughuniversityXis is an explicit rejection of Western ideas about democracy and free speech in favor of Communist Party leadership in every aspect of life and a desire to challenge the United States preeminent role in the Asia-Pacific region and beyondOn Wednesday more evidence of Xis power will emerge when he introduces to the media theother members of the Communist Partys top leadership the Politburo Standing Committee Experts say it is unlikely that a clear successor will emerge or be anointed leaving Xis preeminent position free of an obvious challenge The 19th Party Congress effectively marks the start of Xis second five-year term as party general secretary But the chances are now higher that this will not be his last  or at least that he will remain the most powerful person in China beyond 2022  The amendment of the party constitution effectively confirms Xi Jinpings aspiration to be the Mao Zedong of the 21stcentury  that means a top leader with no constraints on tenure or retirement age said Willy Wo-Lap Lam a political expert at the Chinese University of Hong KongThe inclusion of Xis name in the party document makes him only the third Chinese leader to be so honored with his ideology joining Marxism-Leninism Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory as a guide to actionChinas Communist Party imposed a system of collective leadership after the death of Mao It was a party scarred by the madness cruelty and famine that one man had prompted throughdisastrous policies notably the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural RevolutionAs a result Xis two predecessors Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao ruled through consensus  as the first among equals at the top of the ladder  and were limited to two terms in powerNow the party is moving in the other direction  Xis power is not unlimited and many of his key policy measures reflect ideas adopted by the party before he took power Yet the past week has seen an explosion of sycophancy toward Chinas leader after his mammoth 3 -hour speech kicked off proceedings last Wednesday This is a personal style of rule much like President Vladimir Putins in RussiaThroughout the week senior officials lined up one after the other to laud what they described as Xis profound courageous thrilling insightful masterpiece of a speech which shone the light of Marxist Truth and moved some of them from the bottom of their hearts some saidIn retrospect it was an overwhelming assertion of authority to a degree unseen since Mao said Franois Godement director of the China-Asia program at the European Council on Foreign RelationsXistill would have to overcome significant obstacles if he wants to remain in power beyond the next party congress in 2022 including a convention that officials retire if they are68 orolder said Yanmei Xie a China policy expert at Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing By that timeXi will be 69There had been speculation that Xi would break fromprevious practice by asking Wang Qishan his right-hand man andpowerful head of the anti-corruption authority to stay on another five years Yet the 69-year-old Wangs name does not appear on a new list of Central Committee members implying that the retirement convention remains in place at least for nowXi also would have to amend the constitution if he wanted a third term as president  or appoint a loyal follower to the top job while retaining power behind the scenes as Putin did in Russia in 2008Nevertheless the fact that Xis name figures in the constitution puts him on a par with the partysimmortals Mao and Deng who had no term limits and did not retire said XieAnd thedrumbeat of propaganda about loyalty to his leadership  combined with the constant threat of an unforgiving anti-corruption campaign that has taken down several powerful rivals  makes it more difficult for anyone who dares challenge himThe introduction of Xi Thought makes the question of succession while Xi is alive a moot issue said Bill Bishop publisher of the newsletterHe is the man with an eponymous theory in the party constitution so no one will have more authority than him  no matter what title Xi holds Bishop saidXi Jinping Thought embodies several important principles experts said primarily that the party is in control of every aspect of life in China including the economy the Internet politics culture and religion The party must be more disciplined and more responsive to peoples needs but its leadership must not be questionedXi highlighted what he called theprincipal contradiction in modern China between unbalanced and unequal development andpeoples needs for a better life  Meanwhile the market will continue to play an important role in the economy but the party and key state-owned enterprises will remain supremeBut the other big message is that China is on a path to become a true global superpower  very much on its own termsUnder his reign there is no more hope of convergence said Godement at the European Council on Foreign RelationsThat would have seen China becoming more open more ruled by law and more democratic as it became wealthier and its interests and political systemultimately converging with those of the WestThe idea of political reform in a Western sense is now firmly outthe window Indeed Chinese state media no longer hides its contempt for the political and economic systems of the WestXis messagepromotes a nationalist assertive China with a much stronger military  a country that he says will not threaten the world but will resolutely defend its interestsBy the middle of this century or before China aims to close the gap economically and militarily with the United States and become the ultimate arbiter in the Asia-Pacific region said the Chinese University of Hong Kongs LamIf Maos era was one of revolution and nation-building and Dengs was one of reform and opening that set China on the path to becoming a global economic power Xis era perhaps is one of control and nationalismof realizing what he calls the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenationDengs influence on the course of Chinese history was weighty but his power was wielded less explicitly often behind the scenes As a result his Theory on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics was not formally incorporated into the party constitution until after his deathFormer leader Jiangs ideological contribution is recognized in the document as the Theory of Three Represents and Hus as Scientific Outlook on Development but neither man is mentioned by nameUnlike many authoritarian regimes where leaders remain in office until they die are overthrown in a coup or exit after a conflict the has developed an institutionalized process for replacing leadersThe CCP holds a National Party Congress every five years to select leaders and approve other initiatives The 19th Party Congress which opened Oct 18 should provide a clear indication of Chinas top leaders for the next five years and perhaps beyond Heres a rundownEvery five years the CCPs leadership meets to appoint leaders revise the constitution and set the partys priorities for the next five years Like US political party conventions the outcome is determined well in advance and there are few surprises CCP leaders finalized much of the agenda and critical decisions in late summer Unlike the American conventions however the outcomes of CCP party congresses remain a closely guarded secret until the actual Party CongressOver 2200 delegates are attending the 19thParty Congress  representing the provinces the military major sectors like state-owned enterprises the financial system and so on The Party Congress is too large to deliberate and decide matters Instead it will ratify whatever decisions party leaders present this weekLook for this Party Congress to do two main things First it will revise the CCP constitution Each party congress amends the constitution to signify the status of top leaders and to identify policy priorities The constitution now contains references to   Jiang Zemins theory of the  and Hu Jintaos  concept  The 19thParty Congress is expected to add some mention of an idea associated with President Xi Jinping either his  or  Neither Jiang Zemin nor Hu Jintao was identified by name in the constitution but each mans ideas were If Xi Jinping Thought makes it into the constitution it would put Xi in the same pantheon as Mao and Deng above his predecessors Jiang and HuSecond the 19thParty Congress will elect a new   a body of over 200 party government and military leaders This is inner party democracy as the Party Congress will get a list of around 230 names and then elect around 220 of them to the Central Committee Party leaders will fully vet the list of candidates in advance only the most trusted people make the final cutThe new Central Committee will hold its first plenary session as soon as the Party Congress concludes next week Its main purpose is to elect a new Politburo of around two dozen top leaders and its  which currently has seven membersThe Standing Committee is the most powerful political body in China Who ends up here will give us a real clue about Chinas top leaders for the next five years and maybe beyond Heres where it gets really interesting Chinas leadership succession is constrained by two factors  Term limits work like this Chinas top leaders can remain in their posts for two terms after which they have to either be appointed to another position or retireXi Jinping has served one term as CCP general secretary and will undoubtedly be reappointed for a second term The big question is whether someone will be elevated into the Standing Committee and identified as Xis successor Xis immediate predecessor Hu Jintao was the heir apparent for 10 years before becoming general secretary in 2002 and Xi himself was added to the Politburo Standing Committee in 2007 to indicate he was next in line for the post of general secretary in 2012  If a successor is not identified there will be speculation that Xi does not intend to resign as party secretary in 2022 at the end of his second term Alternatively the CCP could resurrect the post of party chairman which the party retired in 1982 a few years after Chairman Mao Zedong died But either of those moves  Xi remaining general secretary for more than two terms or taking the title that Mao used to hold  would indicate that Xi holds dominant sway over other party leadersThe CCP age limits also may see some bending Once leaders turn 68 they cannot be reappointed though they can serve out their terms Five of the seven current Standing Committee members are over that age limit One of them  Wang Qishan  is one of Xis most important allies and has been in charge of the ongoing  that has removed both tigers and flies in other words central-level party government and military leaders  even retired leaders  as well as local leaders Xi may want to keep Wang and others around in some official capacity but that would require violating the agreed-upon age limitsChinas term and age limits arent completely ironclad Only in the transition from Hu Jintao to Xi Jinping in 2012 were they fully honored Before that Jiang Zemin maneuvered around the age limits in 1997 and skirted the term limits in 2002 when he held on to the post of chairman of the Central Military Commission even though he resigned as general secretary and president But these limits have been enforced against all other top leaders The current 19thParty Congress will therefore be a test of how strong those norms really areThis may seem like a bottom-up process local party members elect delegates to the Party Congress which elects the Central Committee which elects the Politburo and its Standing Committee But its really a top-down process Incumbent and retired leaders negotiate for months about who will remain who will be promoted and who will retire This is old-school politicking designed to keep or change the balance of different factions and institutional interestsThese leadership changes are not simply about political power as there are policy implications For the past few years there has been a stalemate between party leaders who want to stimulate the economy for short-term growth and those who favor longer-term economic restructuring It is thought that Xi favors restructuring the economy but it is hard to know for sure Chinese leaders no longer openly display their   If the leadership changes break that stalemate the CCP may finally start addressing the problems of local debt overcapacity in some sectors and pollution This assumes that Xi has a reform agenda in mind So far there has been little evidence of that Like Vladimir Putin in Russia his goal may simply be to remain in powerOnce the Party Congress and Central Committee meetings conclude next week we will have a clearer sense of Xis power Even if he wants to remain in office for more than two terms and keep allies close even though they are past the retirement age are other party leaders willing to abandon these norms The outcome of the 19th Party Congress will give us a much better sense of how well institutionalized elite politics in China has becomeThe Dictators Dilemma The Chinese Communist Partys Strategy for SurvivalChinas ambassador on Monday brushed off the Trump administrations complaints that Beijing is employing predatory trade and economic practices to bully and intimidate neighbors suggesting that the United States look in the mirror because they might be describing themselvesAmbassador Cui Tiankais comments during a briefing with reporters came as President Trump prepares to leave Washington at weeks end for a 12-day swing through five Asian nations including China during which the main topics are expected to be confronting North Korea and discussions on US trade relations in the regionCui emphasized that Chinese President Xi Jinping fresh off his consolidation of power at Chinas 19th Communist Party Congress is preparing to welcome Trump with a lavish reception including a military honor guard and formal banquet The ambassador said the aim is to honor Trump on his first visit to China since taking office with a state visit-plus that aims to replicate Trumps two-day summit with Xi at Mar-a-Lago in south Florida in AprilAt the same time however Cui sketched out a muscular view of Chinese foreign policy and urged the United States and its allies to do more to pursue a negotiated solution to Pyongyangs nuclear weapons program and to ratchet down rising tensions on the Korean PeninsulaCui said China is faithfully implementing the United Nations Security Councils new economic sanctions on North Korea but he added that if only China is making its best efforts and others are doing things that lead to an escalation of tensions this issue will not be solved It will become even more difficult and the end result will hurt everybodys interestsThe ambassador declined to specifically address Trumps UN speech last month during which he vowed to totally destroy North Korea if necessary or Trumps tweets in which he derisively referred to dictator Kim Jong Un as the Little Rocket ManIm not the White House spokesman he said But he said that other countries could do more to seek a negotiated solution I do not think there has been sufficient international efforts on this front China will do its utmost to promote dialogue and negotiation We have put forward so many proposals  freeze for freeze and the dual track approach [to diplomacy] I just hope others have a more positive response to our proposalsThe Trump administration following the policies of past administrations has refused to entertain the idea of freezing US and South Korean military cooperation in exchange for a freeze on North Koreas nuclear and ballistic missile programs Trump has continued to push Beijing to exert more pressure on Pyongyang and the administration granted additional powers to the US Treasury Department to enact sanctions on foreign companies and banks that do business in North Korea China is the Norths largest trading partnerWe are taking measures to implement the sanctions though honestly many sanctions are being implemented with high costs for China itself because we are DPRKs neighbor he said using the acronym for the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea North Koreas formal name But we still believe theres a larger global interest of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula so we are willing to take up more costsTrump is scheduled to arrive in Beijing on Nov 8 after stops in Tokyo and Seoul He will have a formal bilateral meeting with Xi and Cui said plans are underway for the two leaders to have significant additional opportunities to talk After two nights in Beijing Trump will visit Vietnam for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and the Philippines for a meeting with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations White House officials saidOn trade Cui vigorously defended Chinas policies and stressed that Beijing is pursuing economic reforms aimed at closing the trade imbalance with the United States which Trump railed on during his campaign Trump has not followed through on campaign threats to label China a currency manipulator but he has continued to suggest that the United States is being harmed by unfair economic practices in China Mexico South Korea and other countriesCui said the two sides have been involved in lengthy negotiations and he predicted that an agreement would be struck to pursue new economic partnerships building on the 100-day economic plan announced at the Mar-a-Lago summitWe proceed good faith and goodwill Cui said There has not been any evidence China is trying to dominate the region He said that some of the trade imbalance is structural due to the United States more advanced position in the global production chain and he emphasized that China will hold its first international import summit in Shanghai next yearWe do not want a trade surplus he added This in the long run will not help Chinas economy It might even hurt Chinas economy We want more balanced trade relations with other countriesAt one point speaking in Chinese Cui noted that China actually runs a trade deficit with the United States in the services sector and he joked that those in the United States should read the writings of former Chinese president Deng Xiaoping who was credited with opening the countrys economy to the West in the late 1970sDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton fell ill during a memorial service marking the 15th anniversary of the Sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks leaving abruptly and inserting new speculation about her health into a presidential campaign in which Republican Donald Trump has called her weak and unfitVideo of Clintons hurried departure from the Ground Zero memorial showed her buckling and stumbling as she got into her van Clintons campaign issued a statement from her doctor later Sunday revealing that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlierThe video circulated on Twitter appeared to show Clinton 68 flanked by several Secret Service agents leaning against a security bollard while agents prepare to assist her into a black van As she steps forward Clinton can be seen falling as agents help lift her into the vanSecretary Clinton has been experiencing a cough related to allergies Lisa R Bardack Clintons physician said Sunday in the statement On Friday during follow up evaluation of her prolonged cough she was diagnosed with pneumonia She was put on antibiotics and advised to rest and modify her schedule While at this mornings event she became overheated and dehydrated I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicelyA planned trip to California on Monday and Tuesday has been canceled campaign officials said late Sunday Clinton had been scheduled to attend several fundraising events across the state in addition to a major economic speech in Southern California and a taped appearance on the talk show Ellen It remained uncertain whether Clinton would continue with her planned travel to Las Vegas on Wednesday Campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said Clinton left the ceremony early and retreated to her daughter Chelseas apartment in the Gramercy neighborhood of Lower ManhattanClinton was not seen for more than two hours after which she emerged from Chelsea Clintons apartment building walking normally smiling and wavingThe incident quickly renewed attention to Clintons health Trump has repeatedly questioned her well-being saying that she doesnt have the strength or stamina for the presidency and accusing her of being exhausted and sleeping too muchAcoughing episode on Labor Day had prompted a fresh round of questions about Clintons health During a speech at a festival in Cleveland Clinton startedcoughing repeatedly at the outset of her remarks took several sips of water and a lozenge and continued to sound hoarse as she spoke Later that day Clinton told reporters her condition was caused by seasonal allergiesAn initial campaign statement about Sundays illness did not mention the pneumonia diagnosis from two days prior adding to public speculation that the campaign was hiding something Clinton has followed an intensely busy schedule in recent days and she had appeared healthy when she convened a meeting of national security experts Friday afternoon in New York and then spoke at a fundraising party that night It was at that fundraiser where Clinton ignited a controversy by claiming that half of Trumps supporters are in a basket of deplorables  Neither Trump who is 70 nor his aides responded to requests for comment Sunday nor did he weigh in on Twitter or in television interviews as he is known to do But attacks from him and his allies including former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani (R) have intensified in the past month as unverified and often debunked theories about Clintons health have floated on the Internet And Sundays incident prompted an avalanche of speculation on social media from other Clinton criticsAccording to two Trump advisers Trump decided to stay away from seizing on the Sunday incident with the aim of bringing Clintons deplorables comments  for which she has expressed regret  back to the forefront of the campaign this week and avoiding any chance for Clinton to say that Trump was overstepping on the health frontIf confronted by reporters about Clintons health Trump plans to say that he hopes she gets well and may raise questions about the campaigns transparency Sunday they added The advisers spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss campaign deliberationsBoth Clinton and Trump had planned to take the day off from formal campaigning in observance of the Sept 11 anniversary Trump attended the same memorial service at Ground ZeroRep Peter T King (R-NY) a Long Island congressman who stood with Trumps group at the ceremony said he spoke with Trump shortly after Clinton departedIt was actually Trump who told me what was going on King said in an interview Sunday He leaned over and told me that Hillary wasnt feeling well I said Really That was all he saidA former Secret Service agent said that the security details movements showed that the agents had not planned for her to leave that early and had to make some rushed security plans on the fly Clintons van was not in place when she arrived at the curb and her detail leader who normally sticks by her side at all times had to leave her momentarily to open the door of her van  A small group of reporters traveling with Clinton was left behind and was not immediately informed that she had departedClinton had arrived at the memorial site at 818 am Reporters traveling with Clinton became aware about936 am that she was no longer standing where she had been near several Democratic officials By 948 am hercampaign confirmed thatClinton had leftthe viewing area but offered no more details until about 11amShortly before noon as Clinton exited her daughters apartment building on East 26th Street she hugged a young girl and posed for a picture waved and briefly answered questions shouted by reporters before she departed in her motorcadeIm feeling great its a beautiful day in New York Clinton saidJust before noon it was 82degrees and humid at Ground Zero although it was probably a bit cooler when Clinton had left two hours earlierIt was pretty hot out there but she seemed fine to me and left on her own accord said Sen Charles E Schumer (D-NY) who also attended the ceremony in an emailed statementRep Joseph Crowley (D-NY) said it is unfortunate that this episode will feed into conspiracies about Clintons health He said anyone could have been similarly affected and Clinton tends to be held to her own demigod statusClinton has been generally healthy with the exception of clotting in one leg in 1998 and a concussion and associated health problems from a fall in December 2012 But she has been attacked repeatedly by critics and accused of hiding more serious health issuesGiuliani a close adviser to Trump who is regularly at his side on the campaign trail said last month that he thinks Clinton is tired and looks sickWhat youve got to do is go online Giuliani said on Fox News Sunday in late August accusing the media of hiding information about Clintons health So go online and put down Hillary Clinton illness take a look at the videos for yourselfTrump showed up to the ceremony with no formal notice to reporters who cover him and there were no arrangements for a media pool This is not the first time that Trump has avoided having a media pool  last month he traveled without reporters to Louisiana to view flood damage and to Mexico City to meet with the Mexican president After attending the ceremony Trump and Giuliani briefly visited New York City Fire Department Rescue Company 1 An NBC News reporter there asked Trump about Clintons health incident this morning Trump shook his head frowned and said I dont know anything about itIf he wins in November Trump 70 would become the oldest president ever elected In December Trump  a four-paragraph letter signed by physician Harold N Bornstein of Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan that contained few specifics but declared that Trump would be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidencyThe letter pales in comparison to the more than 1000 pages of medical records released in May2008 by Sen John McCain (Ariz) who was then 71 and went on to become the Republican presidential nominee The records detailed eight years of care that McCain received while fighting cancer Trumps spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in late August that Trump has no problem releasing a full medical history as long as Clinton does the same Last week Trump said that he is willing to go first On Friday The Dr Oz Show announced that Trump and his eldest daughter Ivanka Trump will appear on the show on Sept 15 to discuss Trumps own personal health regimenClintons 2012 episode led to a brief hospitalization for a blood clot in her head Details on Clintons condition were initially hard to come by but her State Department office eventually provided extensive medical informationClinton wore special corrective glasses for months and her husband former president Bill Clinton told an audience in 2014 that it had taken about six months for his wife to recover fully Clinton has said she was surprised by the illness because she had not experienced anything like it beforeClintons campaign  from her personal physician Bardack in July 2015 pronouncing the candidate healthy and suffering no lasting effects from the concussionThe 2012 concussion caused concern among Clinton friends and supporters who hoped that she would make a second run for the presidency some of whom predicted correctly that the episode would fuel speculation that Clinton was too frail to be commander in chiefHer campaign dismisses any suggestion that the candidate is not up to the job while suggesting that the speculation is an example of a sexist double standard that is not applied to male candidatesClinton is the first woman to become a major-party presidential nominee The health questions come as she tries to make a more personal and direct appeal to voters that focuses on her credentials and backgroundAs rumors have mounted about Clintons health in recent weeks her running mate Sen Tim Kaine (D-Va) has inserted a short section into his speeches about how much stamina she hasDuring a keynote address Saturday night at a Human Rights Campaign dinner Kaine said I cant imagine the stamina and energy it takes to run this campaign for 18 months Kaine added This is one determined lady Gearan reported from Washington Kayla Epstein and Philip Bump in New York and Jenna Johnson Carol D Leonnig Robert Costa and John Wagner in Washington contributed to this

just isnt going to come from the powerhouse East DivisionA week after  it stumbled again as Michigan State kicked a last-second field goal to earn a  in a lightning-delayed game in East LansingAnd Ohio States control of the division lasted all of seven days as it went to Iowa and departed with a (see more below)Thats two losses apiece for Ohio State and Penn State And while were at it thats two setbacks each for Michigan and Michigan StateA philosophy of two-and-through as an eliminator has effectively worked in the first three years of the playoff era That wont work every year but its worth asking Who have these guys defeated besides each otherPenn State offers some hope with defeats of Iowa Michigan and Northwestern Michigan State has its division triumphs to go with a victory over Iowa Ohio State It beat Army and Penn State  and thats about itThe Buckeyes are basically done as a playoff contender and both Michigan State and Penn State need some help elsewhere to go along with winning out It all leaves 9-0 Wisconsin  a team largely forgotten about in part because   as the most plausible semifinal candidate from what was once briefly the land of Legends and Leaders The Oklahoma quarterback threw for a school-record 598 yards plus five touchdowns as the  to remain in the national title chase  While the Sooners (8-1 5-1 Big 12) tacked on an impressive road victory Mayfield has a case to be the favorite for the Heisman Trophy with four weeks left in the season Unlike last year when Louisvilles Lamar Jackson emerged as the obvious pick and could afford some November hiccups theres a little more parity to this years fieldThat means a shaky game from Ohio State quarterback JT Barrett and quiet ones from tailbacks Saquon Barkley (Penn State) and Bryce Love (Stanford)  all in losses all on the same day  will help Mayfields candidacy It also opens the door for a popular voting trope  best player on the best team or at the very least best player on a playoff team  to dominate the Heisman proceedings next month* The Hurricanes didnt clinch the ACCs Coastal Division just yet thanks to Virginias victory but pretty much everything else went perfectly for Mark Richts bunch It forced four turnovers in a defense-oriented game while handling Virginia Tech 28-10 to improve to 8-0   Where in the world did that come fromNot the Iowa-beating-Ohio State-at-home part of things The Hawkeyes have a history of making life miserable for visiting teams They beat Michigan last year They nearly beat Penn State this season And this isnt exactly a recent phenomenon eitherBut the hanging-half-a-hundred portion of the festivities That was unexpectedConsider that the Hawkeyes (6-3 3-3 Big Ten) hadnt scored 50 points against any Big Ten opponent since 2008 (Minnesota) In the nine years since that 55-0 victory Iowa had reached 50 points in nonconference play only twice (against Western Michigan in 2013 and North Texas in 2016) In their last four outings the Hawkeyes had participated in three 17-10 gamesNate Stanley was superb throwing for 226 yards and five TDs Meanwhile four Barrett interceptions led to one defensive touchdown for Iowa and another 10 points secured on short fields Even with those factors its tough to find something more surprising this weekend than Iowa scoring with such ease against Ohio State It took two months longer than anyone would have guessed and came against the Big 12s biggest punching bag but the Bears have their first victory under Charlie Brewer threw for three touchdown passes as  to become the last power conference team to earn a victory With the Bears (1-8 1-5 Big 12) on the board the only winless teams left in the FBS are Georgia Southern and Texas-El Paso Not only did the Bulldogs (9-0 6-0 SEC) handle  they sealed the SEC East when Kentucky lost to Mississippi Given the dominance of the Georgia defense and the chaos in some other leagues (to varying degrees in the Big Ten Big 12 and Pac-12) its looking more likely that a 12-1 Georgia with a loss to Alabama in the SEC title game would still find its way into the playoff The Cavaliers (6-3 3-2 ACC) are headed to the postseason for the first time since 2011 after  It spares Virginia the misery of a six-game losing streak to end the year at 5-7  which was a distinct possibility with Louisville Miami and Virginia Tech still to come  and is a sign of concrete progress in Coach Bronco Mendenhalls second season Turns out a 42-7 bludgeoning at the hands of Georgia followed a day later by the ouster (sorry mutual parting)  wasnt rock bottom for the Gators Maybe a  will qualify as the low point for Florida (3-5 3-4 SEC) which must win out against South Carolina UAB and Florida State to become bowl-eligible  The Gators are stuck playing out the string in a lost season under interim coach Randy Shannon But theres no reason that should be obvious to all who are watching While Missouri (4-5 1-4) is playing better since its bye week it stillhas a wobbly defense That didnt matter against Florida which needed 11 possessions before scoring its first touchdown The Texas A&M coach was a popular option for hot seat lists before the season Then came the opening week meltdown against UCLA a commendablerebound and now back-to-back losses to Mississippi State and Auburn the latter a  on SaturdayAt 5-4 the best the Aggies can do by the end of the regular season is reach 8-4 And thats exactly the regular season record Sumlin led Texas A&M in three of the last four seasonsIts plain for all to see that Texas A&M has hit a plateau  the proverbial  though Glen Plus One might be a more appropriate term in this case  and might ultimately regress by a game or two this year A late-season slide is nothing new in College Station and this years seems likely to precipitate a change Three losses equals three strikes for the Cardinal no matter how wacky the year  doesnt entirely knock it out of the Pac-12 North race but David Shaws team isnt going to climb back into the playoff hunt even if it beats Washington Notre Dame and the Pac-12 South champ over the next monthSide note This pretty much leaves Washington  feeble nonconference schedule and all  as the only viable playoff possibility in the Pac-12Conor McGregor apologized for recently being overheard using a homophobic slur The UFC lightweight champion added that he has advocated in the past for LGBT rights in Ireland and that the criticism he has received is another example ofthe desire some people have to throw him under the busThat criticism began earlier this month after McGregor was shown on video consoling hisSBG Ireland teammate Artem Lobov following a loss at UFC Fight Night 118 in Gdansk PolandAll Im saying hes a f-t McGregor  with his arm around Lobov I never knew he was a f-tIn a segment for Irelands  set to air Friday McGregor explained that he had been watching a sparring partner a training partner a friend a brother of mine who has given his health his body health his brain health everything to help me prepare for fights to give my brain health and my body health to entertain the public He said he was upset by the manner in whichAndre Fili defeated Lobovin a potentially career-defining fight which involved stalling and running awayI was whispering in his ear and I was speaking on that and I said what I said the 29-year-old McGregor said I meant no disrespect to nobody of the LGBT community I didnt mean no disrespectYoud swear I was screaming at two people of the same sex kissing he continued I campaigned when we were trying to get same-sex marriage legalized I was campaigning for thatIt is another one where things just get blown out and they love to just any chance they get they love to throw me under the busI meant no disrespect  apologises for using the word f****t recently watch McGregor on the  this Friday  The Late Late Show (@RTELateLateShow) In 2015 McGregor  out his support for a national referendum in Ireland that would allow same-sex marriage (it was approved by 62 percent of the voters) He followed that up with comments at a promotional event for his UFC 189 fight against Jose AldoWe all deserve equal rights McGregor  at the time Were all human here at the end of the day regardless of color gender sexuality Any of that Its all meaningless We all deserve the same rights It just feels right to meMcGregor has also been accused of racist comments in the past particularly in remarks he has made while belittling future opponents While promoting his August fight with Floyd Mayweather he told the boxer  then described the film Rocky III as the one [with] the dancing monkeys in the gymAhead of the fight against the Brazilian Aldo McGregor said What I really want to do is turn his favela into a Reebok sweatshop They work well over there In 2016 he calledNate Diaz a cholo gangster from the hoodIm human I slip up I say stupid things every damn day All I can [do] is hold my hand up and apologize if anyone was offended McGregor told Reuters on Tuesday The word used to describe that opponent [Fili] was incorrect and very offensive and I can apologize for that(H/T )Conor McGregor who once said the only weight he cared about was the weight of the checks has little desire to be a prizefighter anymore At least thats what the 29-year-old Irishman told a group of adoring fans who ironically perhaps paid up to $1400 for a seat at SEC Aradillo a 3000-seat venue in Glasgow to listen to him talk this weekInstead of money in the boxing ring its legitimacyhes after in the UFC Octagon where he has yet to defend the lightweight title he won last November against Eddie AlvarezIve already gone from the highest of the high in terms of a money fight he said (via ) alludingto his August boxing loss to Floyd Mayweather forwhich the UFC star took home  Now the question I always get is about defending the [UFC] belt and legitimizing the sport and the rankingsRanked the No 2 pound-for-pound fighter in the UFC behind flyweight Demetrious Johnson McGregor is the only lightweight to make the top 15 But that hasnt stopped many fans of mixed martial arts from alleging the Irishman might be purposefully avoiding defending his belt due to  an undefeated fighter from RussiaNurmagomedov has been angling for a fight with McGregor for a year but injury and other circumstances have kept him out of the OctagonMeanwhile No 2 contender Tony Ferguson is set to face Kevin Lee for the interim lightweight title at UFC 216 next Saturdayfollowedperhaps by a chance to meet McGregor before Nurmagomedov gets his shotIm very interested in seeing this fight [next] weekend and to see how the lightweight title picture pans out and to go in and correct that whole situation McGregor said Friday Thats where my thoughts areOf course he hasnt quite ruled out prizefighting altogether McGregor expressed interest in again fighting Nate Diaz who he has met twice before winning once While no belt would be up for grabs that matchup would probably earn him the most possible money in the OctagonIt will happen he said of the fight before insinuating that he realizes the payout wont approach anywhere near what he got for fighting Mayweather whos now retiredThe more I spend time away from it McGregor said I think Ive already done all of the money fightsSen Bob Corker (R-Tenn) the chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee who has recently emerged as a finalist in the search for Donald Trumps running mate told The Washington Post in an interview Wednesday that he has taken himself out of consideration for the positionCorker said that he informed the presumptive Republican presidential nominee of his decision during their day together on Tuesday when the senator had a series of meetings with campaign officials in New York and then flew with Trump to an evening rally in North Carolina  There are people far more suited for being a candidate for vice president and I think Im far more suited for other types of things Corker said in an extensive phone interview where he repeatedly praised Trump and said he is eager to serve as an informal adviser to the candidate in the coming monthsAs they sat close together on Trumps Boeing 757 Corker recalled telling Trump about how hes more policy-oriented than political and how even though he has become friendly with Trump he did not feel comfortable stepping fully into the role of political attack dog or rousing speechmakerIts a highly political job and thats not who I am Corker said We had a very open conversation about that and actually we have been very candid about it from the very beginning of our meetings I left there feeling very good about him as a person but also realized that at age 63 I know the things Im good at doing And knowing what a candidate for vice president has to do its just not the right thing for me and I dont think its the right thing for themSo Im going to move on Corker said I am very positive about him as a person It was incredible to be with him in Raleigh and see the way people react to him Theyre so excited and I truly believe he has such an opportunity aheadCorker added that he expects Trump to make a final decision on his pick by July 15 three days before the opening of the Republican National Convention  Over the past month Corker has been under serious consideration by Trump and had submitted personal documents to lawyerAB Culvahouse Jr who is managing the vetting processCorkers sudden departure from the campaigns high-stakes deliberations over the selection leaves a group of Trump allies still in the runningFormer House speaker Newt Gingrich New Jersey Gov Chris Christie and Indiana Gov Mike Pence remain near the top of the short list according to multiple Trump campaign associatesIn the interview Corker said he spent eight hours with Trump on Tuesday starting with meetings at Trump Tower in Manhattan in the late morning and ending in the late eveningYesterday tightened the bond and certainly a friendship has been created It was a pretty remarkable day he said I spent a good deal of time with Ivanka and Jared Trumps elder daughter and her husband Jared Kushner I spent a good deal of time with Paul Manafort just about where things are going Then there was time with Trump in his office and on his plane He said he also spent time with Trumps son EricI do wish people had an opportunity to visit there and see the people who work with him Theyre the kind of people I like to be associated with You dont get the caricature of Trump if you will You see he couldnt be more of a gentleman and how he acts the same with both the most senior and the most junior people around him he saidCorker first came into Trumps orbit after praising aspects of the candidates foreign policy Both men are not aligned with the GOPs hawkish wing and found themselves at times echoing each other about how the United States should operate in the world  Eventually Corker found his way to Trump Tower in May for a private conversation with Trump a visit thatstoked vice-presidential speculationI wasnt going to say anything I just came to visit Corker said onstage Tuesday alongside Trump But I have to tell you something The rallies that I have back home arent quite like thisPretty good pretty tough Trump interjected smiling as he pointed at supportersPretty cool Corker said This is unbelievable isnt itIs a dangerous pattern emerging in US-China relations International relations scholar Graham Allison coined the term  in 2012 to explain how a rising power can instill fear in an existing power leading to hostility and mistrust that can escalate into warIn his  Allison argues that China and the United States are falling into this trap which owes its name to Greek historian  of the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta which proved disastrous for both sides Fast-forward a couple of millennia and some observers worry that Washington and Beijing are heading toward the same fate  But the focus on whether the United States and China will follow this path has obscured another insight from Thucydidess classic work   how the geography of East Asia would shape what a US-China war might look like and just how dangerous and destructive such a war may beThe Thucydides Trap we often see in debates about rising powers is actually a simple version of power transition theory which dates back to the  The idea is that a war between great powers is more likely when a rising state seeks to topple the international pecking order It is easy to see why this idea might be applicable to contemporary US-China relationsThere are other ways to view the situation Some scholars have argued that things may be more stable when two leading powers are at similar strength others argue that the sources of war lie elsewhere And the  does not provide a lot of evidence that rising and dominant powers fight directly or for the reasons that power transition theorists suggest This leads some scholars to suggest that the power transition model is a  to understanding None of this discussion means that US and Chinese analysts should ignore Thucydides although perhaps they should look for inspiration from other parts of his bookThucydides is best remembered for his short argument about the causes of war but he said much more about its conduct His insights are quite relevant for a hypothetical clash between the United States and China This is especially the case in his commentary on the first few years of the Peloponnesian War where he describes how Athens and Sparta stumbled into a protracted fight that neither side expectedHow they got there has to do with a very different kind of Thucydides trap They wanted a quick victory and they wanted to avoid their respective enemies comparative military advantages Both opponents fell victim to delusions about bloodless victory without hard fighting After their early efforts failed they faced a terrible dilemma capitulate or settle into a long and uncertain warAnd both sides faced the same basic challenge when the war began in 431 BC  how to avoid engaging on terms that favored the enemy Sparta (like China today) was a dominant land power while Athens was the dominant naval power (like todays United States) Sparta needed to figure out how to defeat Athens without challenging its navy directly Meanwhile Athens needed Sparta to concede without taking the risk of a pitched battle on land against the formidable Spartan army  Neither side had a good solution  but they pursued operational fantasies about how to win without having to challenge the enemys main area of strength Athens wanted to use its navy to assist land forces that would conduct raids on Spartas allies while simultaneously encouraging a slave insurrection in the Spartan homeland Sparta for its part thoughtthat others would take on the Athenian navy on its behalf  and then it could focus instead on fighting on landNot much came out of these plans for the first few years As long as Sparta and Athens were unwilling to challenge their counterparts directly neither was able to hurt the enemy enough to force surrender Neither side was willing to back down And because they could both retreat to reliable sanctuaries  Sparta on land Athens at sea  they didnt need to seek termsA toxic blend of geography and politics conspired against the Greek great powers and the result was an exhausting war that no one wanted Geography enabled retreat while political pressures encouraged continued fighting Meanwhile the military balance held with Sparta dominant on land and Athens controlling the water What followed were years of costly but indecisive campaigns Neither side was strong enough to win nor weak enough to loseHeres how this applies to US-China relations today As I explain in a forthcoming article in the  the United States and China risk slipping into this patternWar is far from inevitable of course But if it did break out the United States and China  like Athens and Sparta  would each be able to retreat safely in the event of early wartime setbacks When we read about potential flash points that could spark a confrontation especially over Taiwan and disputed maritime claims this geographic risk lurks in the backgroundWartime setbacks that send each side retreating to its safe haven are possible perhaps even likely given that both sides are placing their bets on elaborate plans to win quickly In this scenario China and the United States would each put a premium on interfering with the others communications and blinding its intelligence capabilities to inject confusion on the battlefield and make it hard to coordinate complex operationsFor the  the goal would be to seize the initiative ensuring freedom of movement in the waters near the Chinese mainland overcoming anti-access weapons and buying time for superior reinforcements to arrive in the region For China it means forcing the United States to fight farther from the shore which might prevent it from effectively defending its regional allies and partners  These plans might sound good in theory but both sides are investing in efforts to secure their communications against debilitating attacks The normal fog and friction of war also work against operational plans that depend on precise attacks with little margin for error Leaders might also become so concerned about  that they scale back their opening moves further decreasing their effectiveness For all these reasons both sides may end up disappointed by the result of the first volleyA quick political settlement might be the rational response in this case but the fact that both sides were willing to take the gigantic risk of war suggests they will find it hard to stomach the prospect of backing down especially if they havent suffered many casualties This is a recipe for a long and grinding warThis is the kind of Thucydides trap that looms over any US-China conflict Geography politics and the maritime-land balance in East Asia create a situation likely to lead to prolonged fighting The central task for strategists is figuring out how to escape it If they cannot the only alternative is avoiding war in the first placeThe Dallas Cowboys signing of Greg Hardy came under a cloud of controversy given that the former Panthers defensive end sat outalmost the entire previous season as his domestic-violence case wound through the court system Hardy ended up serving a four-game suspension and after upon joining the Cowboys he also made news for a  with wide receiver Dez BryantHardy also had six sacks and an interception for Dallas but a report Thursday claimed that the team which signed him to a one-year deal is ready to part ways with the defensive end The reason though apparently has less to do with any possible anger issues on Hardys part and more to do with his penchant for partyingThe expectation from their side is that the Cowboys are not going to bring Hardy back said  The problem for the Cowboys Cole continued is that Hardy partied a lot during the season and simply was not in great physical shape as the season wore on and on and onThat was part of the reason he was tardy to several meetings during the season and part of the reason why the team felt so distracted by his presenceAll of that said Hardy played extremely well and  everyone will say he was a force on the field And thats one of the reasons why sources close to Hardy say that hes going to sign with somebody during free agency It will not however be the CowboysStephen Jones on bringing back Greg Hardy Were not gonna address that yet Still a work in progress Well continue to have discussions Jon Machota (@jonmachota) So to recap Hardy liked to party and that made him tardy Of course if that kind of behavior is a major problem in Dallas one has to wonder about all the chatterHardy is still just 27 years old and he had 26 sacks combined in the 2012 and 2013 seasons so it is likely that some team will take another chance on him However for a player loaded with baggage having apparently worn out his welcome in Jerry Jonessrelatively lax environment has to be viewed by many squads as yet another red flagMany if not most MMA fans have given up on the hope of Ronda Rousey evercompeting again in the octagon but her longtime coach recently said that he would like to see her take on rival Cris Cyborg Justino That got the attention of the Brazilian fighter who said Tuesday that shed still be up for a match against Rouseyif its inside the WWE ringBoth of us are now at different chapters in our careers and for me that chapter is finished the 32-year-old Justino  of a long-awaited MMA showdown with Rousey The two traded verbal shots for years but competed at different weight classes and for the most part in different companiesWhen Justino joined the UFC in 2015 it raised hopes that she and Rousey would finally square off but that year saw the beginning of the apparent end of the latterssuperstar-making career Undefeated at that point Rousey went on to lose her bantamweight crown in a stunning knockout loss to Holly Holm then took over a year to return to competition only to get knocked out again in just 48 seconds by Amanda Nunes at DecembersUFC 207Since then Rousey has remained mostly silent about her plans leaving it to UFC President Dana White with whom she is close to assert that the 30-year-old former Olympian is likely done with MMAShe hasnt told me shes retiring but I dont think shes [coming back] White  in April Last year he  of Rousey She loves acting shes good at it and if she dedicates herself to it shell be even better at itIf Ronda is wanting to make the fight for the fans I would still be willing to give them it but I think it would be better to take place inside the WWE ring Justino said on her website For her it gets her one step closer to Hollywood and for me it would be another exciting challenge and a chance to test my athletic abilityRousey appeared at WrestleMania 31 and she recently popped up again  amid reports that she is in fact  Justino has also dipped her toe in that pool having challenged WWEs Becky Lynch to a match at AugustsSummerSlamRouseys MMA coach Edmond Tarverdyan said Monday on  that a Justino fight would be the one for which he would like to see Rousey returnI want that fight he saidWhen I trained Ronda I know Ronda could beat Cyborg I know that Cyborg is too slowJustino shot back at the coach Tuesday saying I also think this [WWE fight] would be the best platform for Edmond as he is not nothing but a joke of a coachThe 1 thing  and me agree on is  is a people user   the fans enjoy rivalry   #UFC219 CyborgVHolm (@criscyborg) Justino suggestedTuesday that a better MMA fight for Rousey would be with Miesha Tate Those two squared off at UFC 168 in 2013 with Rousey winning by a third-round submission in what was until 2015 one of her toughest fightsWhen I wanted to fight her it was because she was at the top of her game and she had all of the confidence in the world Justino said of Rousey She had not been KOd twice in a row and some people were actually saying she could beat Floyd Mayweather in a fightJustino who has spent most of her career fighting at the 145-pound level said she almost killed herself trying to get down to 135 pounds where Rousey competed For her part Rousey often disparaged her would-be opponent by referring to a 2011 steroids-related suspension for Justino claiming that Justinos penchant for cheating was the reason the Brazilian had trouble moving down to bantamweightJustino ended her online comments Tuesday by pushing for a match with Holm at UFC 219 in December Holm has also expressed an eagerness for that fight which would be for the UFC featherweight titleMany Democrats expressed outrage Thursday at allegations from a former party chairwoman that an agreement with the Democratic National Committee gave the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton some day-to-day control over the party early in the 2016 campaignDonna Brazile a former interim chairwoman of the party says in  that an August 2015 agreement gave the Clinton campaign a measure of direct influence over the partys finances and strategy along with a say over staff decisions and consultation rights over issues like mailings budgets and analyticsThe control was given in exchange for a joint fundraising pledge by the Clinton campaign that helped fund the DNC through the election year Brazile saysThis was not a criminal act but as I saw it it compromised the partys integrity she wrote in a  a portion of which was excerpted Thursday in Politico Throughout the campaign the DNC and its then-chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz fiercely denied any suggestion that the party was helping Clinton over other candidates The presidential campaign of Sen Bernie Sanders (I-Vt) had criticized Wasserman Schultz for limiting the early primary debate schedule allowing party money to be used for Clinton fundraising and briefly cutting off Sanderss access to the party voter file shortly before the New Hampshire primary after a Sanders staffer inappropriately accessed informationSome Democrats now say the arrangement is evidence that the concerns were valid Ray Buckley the chairman of New Hampshires Democratic Party said that he first learned of the agreement while serving as DNC vice chair in 2016 The day that Donna discovered this she called me and I almost passed out Buckley said We were blatantly misledIn response to the report Thursday Sen Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) said in a CNN interview that she believed the primary contest between Clinton and Sen Bernie Sanders had been rigged This is a real problem she said We have to hold this party accountablePresident Trump also jumped on the controversy with a tweet on Thursday night that suggested the Justice Department should investigate the real collusion and dishonesty even though Brazile and the Sanders campaign have not alleged criminal activityDonna Brazile just stated the DNC RIGGED the system to illegally steal the Primary from Bernie Sanders he wroteTrump said in an interview with Fox News Channel broadcast Thursday night that the Brazile allegations are a major storyIts illegal number one and its really very unfair to Bernie Sanders Trump told Fox host Laura Ingraham I thought that was terribleThe current leadership of the party said it would address the problemOne of my goals here as DNC chair is to make sure that the nominating process for 2020 is a process thats fair and transparent for everybody DNC Chairman Tom Perez said in an interview with CNBC Were going to set the primary debate schedule well in advance of when we know which candidates will be thereCharlie Baker the chief operating officer of the Clinton campaign said that in 2015 the campaign agreed to raise money for the parts of the DNC that were going to be most crucial to the general election including data research communications and the like The agreement also gave the Clinton campaign some say over personnel If there was a vacancy for a position in one of these departments the DNC had to consult the campaign on the three finalists but could make the final decision itselfWe never tried to be presumptuous Baker said We were literally trying to make sure the DNC had the resources it needed whoever was the nomineeThe joint fundraising agreement allowed Clinton to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars from individual donors  money that was spread across state parties under federal campaign guidelines Sanders had a different fundraising model relying more on small-dollar donations directly to his campaign and he told the DNC that his campaign was not interested in following the same programThe idea that the DNC was willing to take a position that helped a candidate in the midst of a primary is outrageous and there is no justification for it said Mark Longabaugh a senior adviser to the Sanders campaignIt gets back to the fundamental way that Bernie Sanders was running his campaign which was to break the stranglehold of big money on politicsJeff Weaver Sanderss campaign manager said in an interview that their campaign was led to believe it had the same joint fundraising agreement as ClintonWe were not offered veto power on staff at the DNC I can tell you that said Weaver This was a laundering operation Theyd go to fundraisers theyd get a $350000 check from donors which was supposed to be divvied up Instead of disbursing that money theyd turn around and run a small-dollar fundraising to generate small contributions that went to the Clinton campaignIn a September 2015 email obtained by The Washington Post a lawyer from Perkins Coie a law firm representing both the DNC and the Clinton campaign wrote the Sanders campaign with a copy of what was presented as a standard joint fundraising agreementThis is the same one we have used with other campaigns wrote attorney Graham WilsonAt the end of the same email Wilson suggested that should the Sanders campaign raise significantly more money than was required to pay for the party voter file then Sanders could have a say in how those funds would be used to prepare for the general electionThe DNC has had discussions like this with the Clinton campaign and is of course willing to do so with all committees raising funds for the Committee Wilson wroteWeaver said the Sanders campaign decided early on to ignore the joint fundraising program and raise small dollars on its own to pay for access to the voter file Who are the wealthy people Bernie was going to bring to a fundraiser Weaver asked We had to buy the voter file right before the primariesAfter the election the effects of the Clinton fundraising effort hit some state parties hard Jane Kleeb who took over Nebraskas Democratic Party in late 2016 discovered that the party had accrued $35000 in debt for the Clinton campaignNebraska never even signed the JFA because we  didnt want to be a funnel for essentially money-laundering Kleeb said And now we learn that a small group of establishment Democrats got to determine who our nominee was That goes against everything that Democratic values are built onKleeb who along with Weaver is a member of the Democrats post-primary unity commission said the party had made some amends under Perezs leadership In his campaign to run the DNC and since Perez has chastised Wasserman Schultz for turning the party into a vehicle for the presidential campaignAfter Braziles book excerpt surfaced state chairs began calling and emailing each other about a change to the DNCs rules and bylaws that would forbid any arrangement like the one Clinton got Buckley and other DNC members suggested that the party should also give DNC members access to its budget which would have made it clear much earlier how the joint fundraising agreement was affecting the flow of money   The 2015 agreement was struck at a time when the partys finances were in a dire situation Two sources said that it was in danger of not meeting its payroll The Clinton campaign had effectively taken control of the Democratic National Committee in the year before the nominating process began said Tad Devine the top strategist for the Sanders campaign They exercised their control through the use of the joint fundraising agreementWith Election Day less than two months away Democrats are increasingly worried that Hillary Clinton has not built a formidable lead against Donald Trump despite his historic weaknesses as a national party candidateEven the Democratic nominees advisers acknowledge that she must make changes and quickly Clinton leads Trump by three percentage points having fallen from her high of nine points in August according to the latest RealClearPolitics average That tightening has frustrated many Clinton allies and operatives who are astonished that she isnt running away with this race given Trumps deep unpopularity and his continuing stream of controversial commentsGenerally Im concerned frankly said former Democratic Senate leader Thomas A Daschle (SD) It still looks positive and I think if you look at the swing states and where she is right now shes got a lead But its certainly not in the bag We have two months to go and I think its going to be a competitive race all the way through I would say shes got at least a 60percent chance of winningAt the same time Daschle said all the things that Trump has done the numbers should be far more explicitly in her favor but theyre notAmong Democrats concerns is the fact that Clinton spent a great deal of time over the summer raising millions of dollars in private fundraisers while Trump was devoting much of his schedule to rallies speeches and TV appearances  although many of those didnt go as well as his campaign may have hopedClinton has focused more heavily on fundraising than Democratic strategists had hoped would be necessary at this stage partly to help Democrats running for Congress and state offices who would be useful to Clinton if she is president and partly to hold off further erosion in the pollsOne new goal for Clinton now aides said is to spend more time trying to connect directly with voters by sharing a more personal side of herself  and by telling them where she wants to take the country  The campaign has long predicted a tightened race and has taken to using recent polls both to imbue supporters with a sense of urgency and to continue raising moneyTrumps pulled neck-and-neck in a few recent public polls and is ahead in the battleground Ohio in one survey campaign manager Robby Mook wrote to supporters His fundraising numbers are spiking  he and the Republicans raised $90million in August (his best month yet) His ground game is growing Mook wroteThat means we cant underestimate our opponent  because if we dont see a serious uptick in our fundraising right now Donald Trumps presidency could be a real possibilityTrumps campaign meanwhile battling historic unpopularity and a flood of public Republican defections has been delighted and somewhat relieved to see the polls tighten Aides attributed the change to Trumps packed August schedule including a visit to Mexico as well as increased discipline  at least by Trump standardsJust as Trump was repeatedly underestimated during the Republican primaries his aides say he is again being underestimated heading into the general election Theres a sense in the campaign that things are finally coming together and that Trump can propel himself ahead of Clinton over the next two monthsThat optimism is less prevalent outside the campaign though many operatives are loath to predict an outcome in such a volatile electionIts really quite amazing that after the Trump adventure this is still a competitive race said Scott Reed chief strategist for the US Chamber of Commerce and a longtime Republican operative who managed Bob Doles 1996 presidential campaignStuart Stevens Mitt Romneys former chief strategist threw cold water on Trumps enthusiasm in an interview Friday saying he has yet to see Trump outperform Romney in any state or with any demographic in a way that would signal that he has a chance to win Stevens said that any talk of Trump having a ground game is fantasy because Trump has yet to build a campaign structure anything like Clintons Stevens called Trumps optimism childishI dont see the path I just dont see the path Stevens said Ive been in these races where youre nine points down then youre five down  youre still losingEven among Democrats who wonder why Clinton isnt doing better the overall view is that she remains in position to win in NovemberIts going to be the craziest 60 days weve ever seen in politics said Mary Anne Marsh a veteran Democratic consultant who is not working for the campaign but said she remains confident in Clintons chances Give me any other Republican and I can tell you exactly how this is going to go down I cant do that with Donald TrumpShe added I dont think weve seen the most negative part of this campaign yet and thats saying a lotMarsh and other operatives said Clinton will benefit by more directly engaging media and the voters in the final stretch of the race  as Trump has been doing alreadyI look at this race and Im thinking thats not a dumb thing for them have to have done said Joe Trippi a veteran Democratic consultantSome changes in Clintons operation are already in evidence on the campaign trail Among them more interaction with the media a series of policy speeches that Clintons communications director Jennifer Palmieri said are more about her than about him and a shift back toward positive messages in television advertising and efforts to present positive elements of Clintons biography elsewhereBy the end of this week the first in which she has traveled on the same plane as her press corps Clinton had appeared four times before their cameras to answer questionsClinton also played to the cameras and showed a flash of irreverent humor Friday when after she had left the podium following a short press conference on national security issues she paused and then returned to answer a shouted question about Trump With dramatic timing and a sardonic smile Clinton slowly shook her head and took a breath before addressing Trumps perhaps ill-advised appearance on a television network backed by the KremlinEvery day that goes by this just becomes more of a reality-television show she said Its not a serious presidential campaign And it is beyond ones imagination to have a candidate for president praising a Russian autocrat like Vladimir Putin and throwing his lot in with him Clinton saidClinton also addressed head-on the perception that she is chilly or aloof telling the online interview site Humans of New York on Thursday that her natural reserve is born of the hard path she walked as a professional womanI had to learn as a young woman to control my emotions she wrote And thats a hard path to walk Because you need to protect yourself you need to keep steady but at the same time you dont want to seem walled off And sometimes I think I come across more in the walled off arenaShe continued And if I create that perception then I take responsibility I dont view myself as cold or unemotional And neither do my friends And neither does my family But if that sometimes is the perception I create then I cant blame people for thinking thatIn addition a television ad released Friday features a relaxed-looking Clinton speaking directly to the camera and making a bipartisan pitch that weaves in some biographical high points from her long career It was the first positive ad released recently after a string of harsh ones that mostly use Trumps own past statements against him while barely mentioning herWeve got to bring people together Thats how you solve problems and thats what Ill do as president she said in the adClinton holds several important advantages She has experience and credentials a vast campaign operation that drew the best political talent of her party the hearty support of a popular sitting president and what seems to be plenty of money She is marginally more popular than TrumpShe also has significant disadvantages Its difficult for either party to win a third consecutive term as evidenced by the fact that Republican George HW Bush is the only example in decades A sizable number of voters think the country is on the wrong trackAnd Clinton is a highly unpopular candidate in her own right Democrats maintain in particular that Clinton faces unprecedented obstacles as both the first woman to be a major-party nominee and the object of sustained Republican attack for 25yearsI dont care what any poll tells me said Clintons running mate Sen Tim Kaine of Virginia during an appearance Friday night in Norfolk Were the underdog until they call us the winner  In the meantime Trumps campaign has done its best to take advantage of those weaknesses After he restructured his campaign in August and seemed haltingly to heed the advice of his newly empowered advisers Trump stepped up his attacks on Clintons transparency her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and the ties between the State Department and the Clinton FoundationTrump has also been moving quickly to build a ground game in battleground states an effort that stalled under Trumps previous campaign leadersAlready the campaign has opened 30new campaign offices in 21states with a heavy concentration in Ohio New Hampshire and Pennsylvania as first reported by CNN Trump has also added more variety to his schedule giving more policy speeches filled with specific ideas instead of just broad promises visiting a black church in Detroit and talking with small groups of supporters and potential supportersIn a Friday afternoon conference call with reporters Republican National Committee officials and Trumps deputy campaign manager touted their field efforts and promoted their National Day of Action in which they will aim to knock on more than 350000 doors across the country on SaturdaySean Spicer the RNCs chief strategist said the number of RNC staffers and volunteers in the key states is up dramatically from four years agoThe footprint is exponentially larger Spicer saidThe Clinton campaign has warned donors and supporters since the convention that the race would be tight and they cannot afford to get too comfortableAs Ive said many many times Ive always thought this was going to be a close election Clinton said ThursdayBut there is little question that Clintons organization is broader and deeper than Trumps In a sign of overall confidence the campaign has actually expanded its outreach in three traditionally Republican states Arizona Utah and GeorgiaClintons top ground organizer Marlon Marshall touted what he called an unprecedented network of staff and volunteers in a memo to campaign supporters Friday He claimed the campaigns strategy has enabled us to take full advantage of Donald Trumps deep unpopularity but warned that this election will be harder to win than many people thinkJohn Morgan a Florida donor and supporter said Clintons slim lead is not surprising given the strong partisan divide nationallyPolitics is like sports You have your team and you are sticking with them all the way If you are an FSU fan there is nothing that your team could do to cause you to root against them much less pull for Florida Morgan said using the football rivalry of Florida State University and the University of Florida to make his pointA slim margin of victory is still victory Morgan said and still would give Clinton a strong governing mandateGeorge Bush lost the total vote and really the electoral college yet entered with what he called a mandate If she wins by five and over 300 electoral votes by those standards her mandate should be monarchy-like powersDemocratic pollster Peter D Hart took the opposite position saying that Clinton cannot afford to just squeak past an opponent as bad as TrumpHillary Clinton needs to win but she needs a victory which will allow her to say the American public has voted for an agenda that they want her to implement he said Johnson reported from Washington Abby Phillip and Philip Rucker in Washington contributed to this reportAs tensions mounted on the Korean Peninsula Adm Harry Harris made a dramatic  An aircraft carrier had been ordered to sail north from Singapore on April 8 toward the Western Pacific A spokesman for the US Pacific Command which Harris heads  the deployment directly to the number one threat in the region North Korea and its reckless irresponsible and destabilizing program of missile tests and pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on April 11 that the Carl Vinson was on her way up there Asked about the deployment in an interview with Fox Business Network that aired April 12 President Trump said We are sending an armada very powerful US media went into overdrive and Fox reported on April 14 that the armada was  toward North Korea But pictures posted by the US Navy suggest thats not quite the case  or at least not yet   A  released by the Navy showed the aircraft carrier sailing through the calm waters of Sunda Strait between the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java on Saturday April 15 By later in the day it was in the Indian Ocean according to Navy photographs In other words on the same day that the world nervously watched North Korea stage a massive military parade to celebrate the birthday of the nations founder Kim Il Sung and the press  about a preemptive US strike the US Navy put the Carl Vinson together with its escort of two guided-missile destroyers and a cruiser more than 3000 miles southwest of the Korean Peninsula  and more than 500 miles southeast of Singapore Instead of steaming toward the Korea Peninsula the carrier strike group was actually headed in the opposite direction to take part in scheduled exercises with Australian forces in the Indian Ocean according to Defense News which  Neither the Pacific Command nor the Pacific Fleet responded immediately to requests for comment On Monday Cmdr Clayton Doss a Pacific Fleet spokesman said only that the USS Carl Vinson and its escorts were transiting the Western Pacific He declined to give a more precise location except to rule out the waters around South Korea or Japan The presence of the US carrier strike group and the threat of a US military strike on North Korea had weighed heavily on Chinese minds and in the media here Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned that storm clouds were gathering and the risk of conflict rising The news that the ships were not where everyone assumed them to be was greeted with some glee in the Chinese media Tuesday Tricked badly the Global Times exulted on its social media account None of the US aircraft carriers that South Korea is desperately waiting for has come Was it all a misunderstanding or deliberate obfuscation Cai Jian an expert from the Center for Korean Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai said the whole episode was part of an elaborate game of psychological warfare or bluffing by the United States He argued that Washington never really intended to launch a military strike on North Korea right now At the peak of the standoff psychological warfare is very important he said Ross Babbage a nonresident senior fellow at the Center for Strategic Budgetary Assessments a Washington-based think tank that focuses on the military said the move may be military signaling by the United States Its more than a bluff he said A bluff suggests youre not serious My understanding is that this US administration is dead serious Its been 40 years of trying to get the North Koreans to back away from the nuclear weapons Babbage said it was also possible that the Trump administration had decided to give China a little time to put its own pressure on North Korea before sending the carrier strike group north Trump met his Chinese counterpart President Xi Jinping on April 6 and 7 and spoke by phone with him on April 11 and may have wanted to give the Chinese some breathing space to before rattling the bars Babbage said Nor should the aircraft carriers presence alone be given too much weight he added since any early strikes on North Korea would likely have been carried out by long-range aircraftMattis said the US administration was working closely with China to address the issue of North Koreas nuclear programYoure aware that the leader of North Korea again recklessly tried to provoke something by launching a missile Mattis told reporters Tuesday on his way to Riyadh Saudi Arabia It shows why were working so closely right now with the Chinese coming out of the Mar-a-Lago meeting  to try to get this under control and to aim for a denuclearized Korean Peninsula that China and the United States South Korea and Japan all share that same interest in While the belief that the Carl Vinson was heading toward Korea was reported as fact by media outlets around the world there were hints it was perhaps not steaming there as fast as many supposed On April 11 US Naval Institute News  that although the carrier had canceled port calls in Australia it had not scrubbed training events to move faster toward the Korean Peninsula and would still take more than a week to enter waters near Korea  a point that was lost amid heated talk of warOther photographs released by the Navy showed the Carl Vinson in the South China Sea from April 12 to 14 In any case the carrier strike force may indeed be finally heading north now The Korea Herald  Monday that the Carl Vinson is due to arrive in South Koreas eastern waters on April 25 in time for another important date on the North Korean calendar the anniversary of the armys founding Quoting unnamed South Korean officials the Herald said the strike group will join the South Korean Navy in a massive maritime drill designed to counter provocation from the North CNN also cited US defense officials as saying the aircraft carrier would arrive off the Korean Peninsula at the end of April Luna Lin in Beijing Dan Lamothe in Washington Thomas Gibbons-Neff in Riyadh and Anna

to Abe in particular The trade pact would have linked the United States with Japan and 10 other nations and Abe had invested significant political capital to move the agreement forward  Despite these hurdles the Trump-Abe relationship seems to be on sound footing More importantly the boost for the US-Japan alliance has been a positive development for the Trump administrationThree reasons might

of Declining Trust and How to Get it BackBy embracing Confederate symbols and flirting with the alt-right Corey Stewart seems to many political analysts to be handing the GOP nomination for Virginia governor to rival Ed GillespieSome also think Stewart is damaging the Republican brand in a way that could hurt Gillespies chances in November  in a general election that could reverberate beyond the Old DominionThe rest of the countrys looking at us and saying Look at these hicks in Virginia said Brian W Schoeneman a Virginia political analyst and blogger who served in the George W Bush administration They dont realize that hes not representative of the broader GOP and the vast majority of us  including Ed  are looking at him with horrorBut Stewart says defending Confederate symbols against political correctness is not just a cause its a winning strategy in an off-year primaryIts a very small turnout election  were talking maybe 4 or 5percent of the entire voter base he said So youve got a certain percentage of the electorate who are going to vote on abortion Youve got a certain percentage of the electorate who are going to vote on illegal immigration Andthen theres going to be apercentage who will vote on thehistorical-monuments issue Pretty soon you add them all up and its a significant portion of peopleAs for damage to the Republican brand Stewart contends that Gillespie and other establishment Republicans have hurt the party by cutting deals with Democrats and refusing to stake out bold positions on tough issuesIts the Bush family and other establishment Republicans who hurt the Republican brand so badly that we got Barack Obama he saidVirginia hasnt had a statewide candidate stand accused of being too cozy with the Confederacy since George Allens Senate reelection bid in 2006 The issue resurfaces now in a particularly high-profile race at a chaotic moment in American politicsVirginia is one of just two states  the other is New Jersey  with a governors race this year The contest is drawing national attention as an early referendum on President Trump and as an example of the populist/establishment tug of war within both major political parties Trumps surprising path to the presidency could embolden more politicians to seek office as provocateurs political analysts said Yet the lesson here could be that only Trump by virtue of his celebrity and personality can get away with itHes made the mistake of saying This [monument removal] is whats going on Im going to go big Jennifer Duffy senior editor for the Cook Political Report said of Stewart But he might have fallen off the cliff When were dealing in an atmosphere of deeply Southern states starting to remove their Confederate monuments maybe its not the issue to go crazy onBut Kyle Kondik who analyzes elections at the University of Virginia Center for Politics said he thinks the strategy could work for Stewart whose rallies sometimes draw more counterprotesters than supporters He noted that polls show many voters have not made up their minds or even tuned into the raceIf youre an underdog candidate looking for something to get attention with Stewart has certainly gotten attention for this he said Just the name ID can be more than half the battle  Sometimes it matters not so much what your own position is but who your enemies are Maybe Stewarts calculation is if he can fire up these protesters those are people that conservative Republicans think are riffraff Therefore he becomes an enemy of the left and that generates more support on the rightStewart and Gillespie started the primary race  along with underdog state Sen Frank W Wagner (Virginia Beach)  as seemingly perfect symbols of the GOPs intraparty angstStewart cut a brasher-than-Trump figure as someone who had led a crackdown on illegal immigration in Prince William County a decade ago He was such an over-the-top Virginia chairman for Trump last year that the campaign fired him Gillespie was the cautious establishment type a former lobbyist Republican National Committee chairman and White House counselor to Bush who kept his distance from TrumpWhich one would sell in an off-year contest in Virginia a state that favored Hillary Clinton by 5 points in November but also gave Trump a narrow primary win That looked like an open question at first when Stewart aimed to attract populists energized by Trumps surprise White House victoryThen Stewart chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors took his campaign in an unexpected direction The impetus was a vote early this year by the Charlottesville City Council to remove a statue of Confederate Gen Robert E Lee from a downtown parkStewart saw an opening and rallied to oppose the monuments removal The move brought him considerable attention after news videos showed counterprotesters shouting him down  From there he made Confederate monuments the centerpiece of his campaign  one that allowed him to skewer Establishment Ed for what he deemed a mealy-mouthed stance While the former RNC chief is also opposed to removal he said its a matter left to local authorities not the governorStewart held multiple rallies for the monument unfurled the Confederate flag at other events and attended an Old South ball in an outfit approximating a Civil War dress uniform  Along the way he gave an interview to Mike Cernovich the alt-right Internet figure who helped popularize the Pizzagate conspiracy theory The alt-right is a small far-right movement that seeks a whites-only state Adherents of the alt-right are known for espousing racist anti-Semitic and sexist points of viewStewart also attended a Charlottesville news conference with Jason Kessler and Isaac Smith founders of  a fledgling group that calls for defending Western CivilizationSmith has sometimes  at events and appeared at his side with alt-right symbols such as placards with Pepe the Frog and a gladiator-style shield At one raucous rally with Stewart at the University of Virginia Stewart said he does not condone white supremacy but welcomes support from anyone who wants to upend the GOP establishmentTheres a revolution going on here in conservative circles and these young people are coming up  very social-media savvy  and they are shaking things up and their views are very disparate he said Ill take support where I can get it But that doesnt mean I believe in everything they believe inSmith 20 said he enjoyed needling liberal activists with Pepe signs and shields at Stewarts events although he rejects the alt-right labelThe term I might use is dissident right Its the part of the right wing that has fun Smith said And part of the fun is just getting a rise out of these sensitive  and Id say sensitive for no good reason  people  Its a frog Its not like Im sending a picture of a member of the Ku Klux Klan holding a noose Its a smiling frog Why does this upset you so muchThe provocations have succeeded in some ways Late last month as Stewart railed against the removal of a New Orleans monument he wound up in a Twitter war with musician John Legend and others But the attention has not translated into support as measured in recent polls  Even at the recent Shad Planking a springtime political confab in the piney woods of Southside Virginia that was open only to white males until the late 1970s support for Stewart was lukewarm When a supporter flew overhead in a plane streaming a Confederate flag and a Stewart sign it drew eyerollsHes relevant in the sense that were all talking about him but were talking about him because he gobsmacked us all at how extreme his campaign has become said Quentin Kidd a Christopher Newport University government professor and pollster  Stewarts support slipped further in recent weeks when all that Confederate stuff led Stewarts local sheriff and longtime ally to yank his endorsement Four of the five Republican supervisors who serve with Stewart came out for Gillespie abandoning plans to stay neutral  Stewart knows people are counting him out  but says they are wrongThe last time liberals got mad at someone & said his campaign is imploding we took back the White House he tweetedIf he makes it to the general election Stewart said that he would start emphasizing more kitchen table issues with broader appealYou dont change your political position just what you talk about he said Obviously Ill be talking more about bringing back jobs and reducing taxesMost political strategists and observers dont think Stewart will be in the race after the June 13 primary They say the leader of Virginias second-largest jurisdiction someone who had managed to win reelection four times in racially diverse Northern Virginia  has turned himself into a fringe candidate This is manna from heaven for Gillespie said Bob Holsworth a former Virginia Commonwealth University political scientist On the one hand [Stewart] has basically ceded much of his home turf to Gillespie which is remarkable And secondly the other benefit it provides Gillespie is that the campaign is so outrageous that it captures all of the media attention and ensures that Frank Wagner gets no traction tooPolitical analysts are more divided on whether even a badly defeated Stewart would give the GOP a black eye that lasts through the general election Many think that come fall Gillespie will have to worry more about being tied to Trump than to Stewart But Democrats would like to yoke him to both They are already criticizing Gillespie for not condemning Stewarts far-right appeals a line of attack that echoes their complaints about Gillespies reluctance to speak out against Trump Not even a Confederate apologist trying to use racism to score political points can draw condemnation from @EdWGillespie Says it all tweeted former congressman Tom Perriello one of two Democrats vying to succeed term-limited Gov Terry McAuliffe (D) Abbi Sigler a spokeswoman for Gillespie declined to comment on Stewarts campaign or Democratic criticism of his silenceCandidates speak for themselves she said Ed is speaking about how we make this a stronger economy for all Virginians and its very clear that his positive message is resonating with voters statewideSome Republicans wish Gillespie would condemn Stewart  among them Schoeneman editor in chief of the conservative blog Bearing DriftMaybe you lose some general-election votes but at least you can look yourself in the mirror in the morning he said I think it has a negative impact on the party as a whole  This is not something that is even remotely reasonableBut Chris LaCivita a top adviser at the RNC for the Trump campaign does not think Stewarts Confederate antics will do any lasting damage And he thinks Gillespie is smart to stay mum about himThe first rule in politics is not to engage the idiot LaCivita said Let the idiot be the idiotThe racy Playboy magazine cover featuring the circa-1990 version of Donald Trump graced the billionaires New York office for years  right next to awards from religious groups and clippings from other magazines that didnt feature naked pictorialsThe cover and the extensive interview inside the March 1990 edition were a feather in Trumps cap placing him in elite company with other political and entertainment luminaries spotlighted by the magazineIn the famous Playboy cover photo Trump iswearing tuxedo pants a cummerbund and a bow tieBut Playmate Brandi Brandt has donned his jacket  and nothing elseI was one of the few men in the history of Playboy to be on the cover he boasted to a Washington Post reporter taking a tour of his office during the 2016 presidential campaignTrump embraced the associationDuring his bid for the presidency he was known to autograph copies of the magazine offering a quick scrawl during campaign stopsTrump continued his relationship with Playboy over the yearsIn 1993 the magazine invited him to be a guest photographer and interviewer in a nationwide Playmate search Seven years later  which featured nude women in sexual positionsTrump also seemed to appreciate the magazines founder Hugh Hefner a self-made man who built an incomparable personal brand Playmate of the Year  returns to the 13th season of All Star she is smart & beautiful Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) In 2006 Trump even invited Hefner onto The Apprentice to tell and to dole outbusiness adviceBut near the end of Hefners life as Trump transformed from businessman to candidate to commander in chief the admiration was apparently far from mutualA month before  one of his sons Cooper summed up their opinion of Trump and that 1990 cover with a less-than-flattering word embarrassmentWe dont respect the guy Cooper Hefner a self-identified liberal told  Theres a personal embarrassment because Trump is somebody who has been on our coverThe magazine Cooper Hefner added is really a philosophy about freedom And right now as history is repeating itself in real time I want Playboy to be central to that conversationDetailing his opinions in a series of tweets last month Cooper Hefner who has assumed creative control of his fathers magazine said that if the team that made Playboys editorial decisions had known what Trump would come to embody the president would have never found his way onto our coverWhy am I embarrassed about this cover Because we promote a philosophy that encourages ALL individuals to choose the life they want to live  Cooper Hefner (@cooperhefner) If the 1990 team at Playboy would have known Trumps platform than the President would have never found his way onto our cover Cooper Hefner (@cooperhefner) -But hindsight is 20/20 and the fight on the intellectual battlefield and for what really makes America great rages on Cooper Hefner (@cooperhefner) Hefner didnt detail the reasons for his fathers changed opinion of Trump Trump had been a regular at Playboy mansion parties for decadesBut as a presidential candidate Newsweek noted Trump pitched himself as a defender of the values of conservative Christians  the very same people Hefner regarded as his chief enemiesTrump also made same-sex-marriage opponent Mike Pence his running mate and Hefner was a longtime supporter of LGBT rights and took high-profile stands on sodomy laws same-sex marriage and transgender rights  Hefner died in his mansion Wednesday of natural causesHe had started his magazine in 1953 as a counterpoint to culturally conservative times and the first edition featured a photo of a nude Marilyn MonroeAs  From the first issue of Playboy in 1953 which featured a photograph of a nude Marilyn Monroe lounging on a red sheet Mr Hefner sought to overturn what he considered the puritanical moral code of Middle America His magazine was shocking at the time but it quickly found a large and receptive audience and was a principal force behind the sexual revolution of the 1960sExcerpts of Alex Haleys Roots and Bob Woodward and Carl Bernsteins All the Presidents Men appeared first in Playboy and Hefner commissioned articles by celebrated writers including Norman Mailer James Baldwin and Joyce Carol OatesAnd the magazine offered in-depth interviews with leading political cultural and business figures  Fidel Castro Muhammad Ali Steve Jobs  and Donald TrumpIn fact in 1990 Trump the businessman opined on what Trump the president would be like A president Trump Donald Trump told Playboy then would believe very strongly in extreme military strength He wouldnt trust anyone He wouldnt trust the Russians he wouldnt trust our allies hed have a huge military arsenal perfect it understand it that after Trump assumed the presidency some foreign governments turned to that 1990 interview to prepare for White House visitsThe interview at turns eerie and prophetic runs through his typically immodest self-assessment and catalogues his political philosophies while offering a scathing appraisal of America which he saw (and still sees) as weak and pushed around by the rest of the world In the interview he also unfurls a blueprint for his hypothetical presidency years before winning the White HouseIn recent months at least two world leaders have shared the interview with their staffs in advance of their first meetings with the president According to the Wall Street Journal Japanese officials revisited it ahead of Prime Minister Shinzo Abes visit last month German Chancellor Angela Merkel also studied it before arriving in the United States this week several sources sayBeyond the standard self-aggrandizement and hagiography of Trumps own business deals what makes the Playboy interview instructive reading for foreign eyes is how with greater depth than many of his campaign sound bites the future president prioritizes Americas trade partnershipsBut when he was interviewed by Playboy Trump claimed that he had no designs on the presidencyI dont want to be president he said Im 100 percent sure Id change my mind only if I saw this country continue to go down the tubesDonald Trump released a note from his personal physician on Monday that assessed the candidates health in positively Trumpian termsTrumps recent lab tests were astonishingly excellent said Harold Bornstein a gastroenterologist on the Upper East Side of Manhattan His recent examination showed only positive results His strength and stamina are extraordinary His cardiovascular system is excellent and he has no history of drinking or smokingWhats more Bornstein writes If elected Mr Trump I can state unequivocally will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidencyClearly Trumps hyperbole is itself a disease  and its contagiousA lot of the claims in Bornsteins note are a doctors effusive analysis of his patient (Bear in mind that it does Bornstein some good to have the worlds most flawless patient) But that last one about the other presidents is positively bafflingEXCLUSIVE  doc says he picked up Trumps language in health letter & interpreted it into my own  NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) In 2008 Barack Obama released the results of  Obama was 46 at the time a quarter-century younger than Trump Although Obama smoked infrequently his blood pressure was  a bit lower than Trumps (In August Trump bragged that his doctor  he had the blood pressure of a great athlete) Obamas doctor didnt portray his lab tests as astonishing but then most doctors dont use such verbiageIn 1994 the late medical doctor John Bumgarner wrote a book called which looked at the physical health of each president through Bill Clinton Many of those diagnoses based on contemporaneous reports and diaries are collected at  a website run by a pseudonymous medical doctorWere familiar with some of the more prominent presidential ailments John Kennedy suffered from Addisons disease and polio was diagnosed in Franklin Roosevelt  But other presidents had a slew of illnesses too partly because of the eras in which they livedGeorge Washington  Harry Truman had  John Tyler  Woodrow Wilson Some presidents we will hasten to point out didnt really have many notable health issues at allJimmy Carter now 91 suffered from nothing worse than hemorrhoidsBut a lot of what we know about the presidents health is a function of their having been president Historians poring over their records such as Trumans  revealed conditions only decades later Would the same doctor who called Trumps tests extraordinary be inclined to gloss over some of the more minor ailments that are worth including in a presidential history That is left as an exercise to the readerFor the most part these reports are pro forma simply meant to reassure people that the person elected president wont drop dead in 30 days William Henry Harrison-style But for Trump it was clearly an opportunity to reinforce a narrative Trump as biggest and best of all timeWe reached out to Bornstein to ask how he felt so confident in his historic comparison We have not heard backInterestingly Trumps website  people to view the health records written by the highly respected Dr Jacob Bornstein Jacob Bornstein is the father of Harold Bornstein who the younger doctor notes has been treating Trump since 1980The strength of Trumps memory is not mentioned in the medical reportThis is a very long quote but we wanted to provide a flavor of Donald Trumps strange revisionist history regarding his mocking of a disabled reporterClearly miffed that his imitation of New York Times reporter Serge F Kovaleski has resulted in a hard-hitting attack by the Clinton campaign Trump offered a lengthy rebuttal in the middle of a campaign rally As he put it the Clinton campaign is run by sick peopleMuch of what Trump says is Four-Pinocchios false So lets unpack his explanationFirst of all this is the ad that the Clinton campaign is running in battleground statesReaders may recall that the controversy started in November when Trump without any evidence asserted this claim about the Sept 11 2001 attacks I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down And I watched in Jersey City New Jersey where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down Thousands of people were cheeringHe  and yet stuck to it even in the face of overwhelming evidence that he was wrongNow lets go back to the recent rally in Colorado Springs going through his explanation in detailThats an interesting admission by Trump in that he concedes his campaign was scrambling for some scrap of evidence that what he said was right In other words Trump mouthed off and the campaign was having trouble confirming his remarks which appeared on Page 6 of The Washington Post on Sept 18 2001 described FBI probes in northern New Jersey in the wake of the attacks In the 15th paragraph it said that law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river (No mention of dancing by the way)Nope not a single fact checker found this article to be significant The language in no way confirms Trumps claim of watching on television celebrations of thousands of Muslims Allegedly indicates there is no video footage or other proof that celebrations actually took placeThis is total fantasy especially the suggestion that the Clinton campaign was upset and somehow got to Kovaleski and made him change his storyWeve checked the records and Kovaleski conductedno on-camera interviews at the time He simply gave the same statement to every news organization including The Fact Checker I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating That was not the case as best as I can rememberKovaleski obviously did not say he made a mistake and did not try to change the article He simply said he did not remember anything that matched Trumps description In other words he only confirmed what the article said  that a number of people were alleged to have celebrated not thousands or even hundredsKovaleski incidentally was not the only author of the article The Fact Checkeralso contacted his co-author Fredrick Kunkle who said despite his shoe-leather reporting the alleged celebrations could never be confirmed I specifically visited the Jersey City building and neighborhood where the celebrations were purported to have happened But I could never verify that reportHere below is a video of Trump speaking about Kovaleski on Nov 24 Note that Trump first says the article was written by a nice reporter (Kovaleski is indeed nice) Then he goes on to mock him jerking his arms in front of his body Now the poor guy you ought to see this guy Ah I dont know what I said I dont remember I dont remember maybe thats what I saidTrumps explanation in Colorado is simply not credible First of all we already confirmed that Kovaleski did not grovel or say he made a mistake Moreover Trump actually appears to paraphrase Kovaleskis brief statement about not remembering that thousands of people celebrated Trump now suggests he was just imitating a grovel but thats not what he was actually doingInstead Trump is clearly imitating Kovaleskis disability the reporter has arthrogryposis which visibly limits the functioning of his joints Trump claims he did not know Kovaleski but the reporterclosely covered Trumps troubled business dealings while he was a reporter for the NY Daily News between 1987 and 1993Donald and I were on a first-name basis for years Kovaleski  in November Ive interviewed him in his office he added Ive talked to him at press conferences All in all I would say around a dozen times Ive interacted with him as a reporter while I was at The Daily News In particular Kovaleski covered the launch of the Trump Shuttle  when the airline launched with typical Trump brashness (Within a year Trump had to unload the debt-burdened airline because of a cash crunch in his business interests)Actually he clearly did protestations notwithstanding (The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment)It remains a mystery why Trump feels the need to revisit past controversies particularly ones that reflect poorly on his tenor and judgment But as the evidence shows Trump clearly mocked Kovaleski who in any case never groveled or in any way took back his reportingIn an unremarkable statement Kovaleski merely said that his reporting did not back up Trumps statement that thousands of Muslims celebrated the fall of the Twin Towers and then Trump attacked him()On Wednesday afternoon David Corn Washington bureau chief of the left-leaning Mother Jones magazine tweeted his dismay at the rude/disrespectful quality of Republican presidential campaign rhetoricNo surprise there But then Corn did something unexpected He

of campaign Positive Hopeful Inclusive GW Bush announcing his 2000 presidential bid David Corn (@DavidCornDC) Pinch me Could it really be that this harsh Bush critic  an MSNBC contributor who authored 2004s   is actually nostalgic for Bushs brand of compassionate conservatismThat was my point  David Corn (@DavidCornDC) Okay not entirely Bush 43 has long been a piata on the left and that will probably never change But lately journalists and publications who composewhat Republicans call the  have been citing him as a positive example of how politicians canshow  more tolerance and civility in their remarks than the current contenders for the GOP nominationMehdi Hasan host of UpFront on Al Jazeera English penned an op-ed in the New York Times on Nov 30 under the headline  Just process that sentiment coming from Al Jazeera and the New York Times for a moment Now read the top of Hasans pieceAs a Briton who like millions of my compatriots opposed the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 I did not expect to ever find much to admire about President George W Bush But as a Muslim who has come to work in America I have recently had to revise my opinionLess than a week after the Sept 11 2001 attacks that killed 2996 people President Bush held a news conference at the Islamic Center of Washington The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam he said flanked by imams and community leaders Islam is peace Fourteen years later such remarks seem distant if not improbable amid the miasma of anti-Muslim hate and fearmongering fostered by the Republican candidates for presidentBushs post-9/11 address at the Islamic Center seems to have made a lasting impression The  in December that Bushs inclusive rhetoric about Muslims has been cited frequently and wistfully during the last few months as Republicans have taken ever-more strident stands on Islam and Muslims A day later  ran an op-ed declaring that Donald Trump makes George W Bush look like a paragon of statesmanshipAfter Islamic State attacks on Paris prompted Republican presidential candidates to  Slates chief political correspondent Jamelle Bouie Bush worked hard to sow tolerance for Muslim-Americans convinced  like President Obama  that respect and openness was an asset in the fight against jihadists Integrated assimilated communities dont give aid to violent extremists In the week since the Paris attacks however his would-be successors  the 2016 Republican presidential field  have jettisoned these efforts Now much of the GOP is stirring anti-Muslim sentimentAnd  liberal host Chris Hayes played part of Bushs Islamic Center address and asked a guest who was there Can you imagine a speech like that being made by a political leader or someone running for president todayIt was basically a rhetorical question with an obvious answer noEven Saturday Night Live has had some fun with the idea that Bush looks rather sensible compared withthe GOP fieldWho thought wed ever reach the point whenthis segment of the media is wishing that Republican candidates would behave more like George W Bush Yet here we areTo be clear The praise for Bush has been very narrow in scope nothing like  during a Republican undercard debate last month when he was still in the presidential running I wish he were president right now we wouldnt be in this mess Graham said referring to the current threat of Islamic terrorism which he blamed on ObamaPositive media references to Bush have been mostly relative rather than absolute Its not that he was  a good president its that todays Republican options are so bad that Bush  pretty decent by comparison Thats the argumentAlthoughsome in the liberal press have offered a hat-tip to W for refraining from demagoguery others have argued that he doesnt deserve even that much Salon has decried what it termed Still the fact that Bush would be invoked as a favorable model isa reminder of just how topsy-turvy the 2016 GOP primary has become Trump & Co not only have members of the media seeing things they never expected to see but also feeling things they never expected to feel about certain former presidentsDonald Trumps foreign policy and national security team has taken shape amid a series of foreign policy crises big and small  including the assault on Aleppo Syria the Chinese seizure of a US drone in the South China Sea and the assassination of the Russian ambassador to TurkeyFor now those crises are the purview of the Obama administration But in less than a month that will change So it is important to take stock of what we have learned about how Trump and his team will react when crises happenSo imagine Trumps first international crisis Here are eight important questionsMuch of this discussion speaks to concerns many  have  And it doesnt mean that there will be a calamitous decision Many excellent professionals remain in the government and  will have an important role to play assuming they But the research on foreign policy decision-making suggests that there will be a significant increase in risk  and not just risk associated with any policy moves Trump makes which are for better or for worse his prerogative Instead the risks will stem from the White House decision-making apparatus itself  how it takes in and processes information makes decisions and implements themEven if crises come out okay dangerous things can happen behind the scenes Many of these risky or dangerous moves may not be visible to the public or even to government officials outside the inner circle In other words no matter what happens in this hypothetical crisis we may not know just how risky Trumps handling of it actually was at least initiallyAnd the risks will not necessarily end with the first crisis The risks may be even greater if Trump is disinclined to learn  as his  on the daily briefing imply  or gains false confidence from a good outcome that may have involved some good luck (as crises often do even when presidents try hard to act carefully and manage risks) This is why continued scrutiny of appointments process and even logistics will remain importantOne fact everyone can agree on All presidents face crises Some day or some night these questions will cease to be hypotheticalFor more see  that I did with  of theIn 2014 someonecreated an online clock and called it Emma you are next It wassupposed to count down the seconds until some anonymousInternet baddie would release stolen nude images of actress Emma Watson The countdown clock turned out to be a appearing just after the Celebgate celebrity photo hacks and after as a UN goodwill ambassador for womenThere were no stolen nudes to release the whole thing its creators claimed was a prank to shut down 4chan overthe sites role in distributing revealing images stolen from the private accounts of female celebrities including Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton Its even more likely that the Emma you are next incident was simply a sketchy attention grab without any real causebehind itThe hoax was believable at the time in part because the distribution of stolen private images of women has become a fixture of online abuse And as it turns out someone out there really was determined enough to abuse Watson in this way Ahandful of private images of the actress appeared online Tuesday night  Photos from a clothes fitting Emma had with a stylist a couple of years ago have been stolen a They are not nude photographs Lawyers have been instructed and we are not commenting furtherIts not clear where the images were first posted or how they were stolen from herOn4chan several photos that appeared to fit her publicists description were still circulating Wednesday afternoon Users were posting them alongside some nude images that did not show the face of the subject Others had photoshopped the original non-nude images to make themmore revealing There was also speculation that the stolen trove of images contained photos of other celebrities  although none mentioned have confirmed that this is the caseCelebgate is the obvious context for the newest release of stolen images Watson had commented on Celebgate after it happenedEven worse than seeing womens privacy violated on social media is reading the accompanying comments that show such a lack of empathy Emma Watson (@EmmaWatson) Celebgate was a major story that brought a lot of attention to this phenomenon of online harassment but it hardly deterred the perpetrators Over the summer hackers  of the actress Leslie Jones and used it to release private information along with stolen nude images Online business empires rose and fell on the premise that jilted exes would be interested in creating revenge porn or publicly posting revealing images of someone along with their name and identifying details without their consentActress Mischa Barton said Wednesday that an alleged sex tape of her reportedly being shopped around to porn companies in Hollywood was in fact revenge porn recorded using secret cameras without her consent by someone I thought I loved and trusted When she learned of what had happened Barton said my absolute worst fear was realizedVery painful time said  MischaBarton   Claudia Rosenbaum (@CJRosenbaum) The victims of this tactic arehardly all famous women or exes In fact celebrities account for just a fraction of the

revealing images of female service members  often accompanied by thewomens names and harassing commentaryThe scope of that particular scandal is unknown but it appears to be And then there are places like AnonIB a message board that shows up again and again in stories about nude-photo scandals where people post revealing images of women that were never intended to be public  A growing number of

this f thing Cable news loves it when they show footage of destroyers firing cruise missiles at night Its Americas money shotTrump authorized the strike on a military airfield in retaliation for a chemical attack on civilians that killed at least 86people  The attack ratchets up the intensity of a complicated regional conflict  and makes a conflict with Russia more likelyNews networks looped

one appalled by the journalists laudatory words wrote that after the strikes praise flowed like wedding champagne  especially on cable newsAnd  Dan Rather took fellow journalists to taskThe number of members of the press who have lauded the actions last night as presidential is concerning he wrote War must never be considered a public relations operation It is not a way for an Administration to gain a narrative It is a step into a dangerous unknown and its full impact is impossible to predict especially in the immediate wake of the first strikePresident Trumps speech on the administrations still-somewhat-vague tax plan delivered in Indianapolis on Sept 27 was filled with many of his favorite inaccurate claims For instance he repeatedly says he is offering the largest tax cut in our countrys history a dubious claim when properly measured as a percentage of the nations gross domestic product Heres a sampling of other inaccurate claims  and one case in which he appears to have adjusted his language because of our previous fact checks The presidents suggestion that millions of small businesses and farms are affected by the estate tax is absurd  only about 5500 estates in 2017  out of nearly 3million estates  would have to pay any taxes About half of estates subject to the tax would pay an average tax of about 9 percent Thats because for a married couple about $11 million is exempt from taxationOnly 80  thats right 80  taxable estates would be farms and small businesses In 1977 139000 estates had to pay the tax In 2000 it was 52000 But Congress has kept raising the exemption and lowering the tax rate So for virtually all Americans even farms and small businesses the estate tax is just not a problemTrump exaggerates here The United States certainly has one of the highest statutory corporate tax rates in the world currently pegged as high as 391 percent when including state taxes (The federal rate is 35 percent) Trump says it is 60 percent higher than our average competitor in the developed world comparing 391 percent to the average rate for the other members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development which is 255 percent when not weighted for GDP (It is 314percent when weighted for GDP)But the official rate does not necessarily tell the whole story What also matters is the actual tax a company pays after deductions and tax benefits That is known as the effective tax rate which can be calculated differently depending on the survey  the effective rate for the United States is 271 percent compared with an effective GDP-weighted average of 277 percent for the OECD Although the US statutory tax rate is higher the average effective rate is about the same and the marginal rate on new investment is only slightly higher the CRS saysThe Congressional Budget Office  said the US effective tax rate was 186 percent which it said was among the highest of the biggest economic powers the Group of 20Kudos to Trump for updating a formerly misleading phrase that more than 90 percent of Americans need professional help to do their own taxes This 90 percent figure refers to people who file taxes by hiring professionals or using tax software such as Turbo Tax which helps people file their taxes on their own  54 percent of individual taxpayers pay preparers and about 40 percent of individual taxpayers use software that costs about $50 or moreStill its worth pointing out that there are more options now for people to easily file their taxes using paid or free softwareThe Internal Revenue Serviceprovides a Free File program a public-private partnership that allows people with adjusted gross incomes of less than $64000 to file their taxes using free software Roughly 70 percent of American taxpayers are eligible for this free software  which partners with the IRS for this program In tax year 2016 the program made a new push to offer moresoftware options that are free for taxpayers Its debatable that this would be much better for a middle-class couple with children  and it could be worse The tax plan would nearly double the standard deduction $12000 for individuals and $24000 for married couples but also eliminate personal and dependent exemptions (currently $4050 per family member)So a couple with two children already dont pay a dime on their first $28800 Thats because they get $12600 in a standard deduction and $16200 in dependent and personal exemptions Its possible Trumps expanded child tax credit might help make up some of the difference but maybe notLily Batchelder a professor of public policy at New York University who was deputy director of the National Economic Council in 2014-2015 conservatively  that Trumps plan would increase taxes for about 87 million families but the number could be as high as 11 million under reasonable assumptions That analysis was based on Trumps campaign plan which envisioned a larger increase in the standard deduction ($30000 for a married couple) This is a flip-flop He was always a fierce critic of the bill Reagans Tax Reform Act of 1986 which he now calls a beautiful sight to behold The law simplified tax brackets and eliminated tax shelters and also lowered the top individual tax rate to 28 percent but raised the capital gains rate to the same level giving them parityIn the years following the law Trump repeatedly blamed it for the savings and loan crisis a decline in real estate investing and the 1990-1991 recessionThis tax act was just an absolute catastrophe for the country for the real estate industry and I really hope that something can be done  In a television interview with Joan Rivers he  What caused the savings and loan crisis was the 1986 tax law change It was a disaster It took all of the incentives away from investorsTrump also frequently attacked one of the Democratic sponsors of the bill Sen Bill Bradley (D-NJ) including in  Mr Bradleys last big idea to be enacted into legislation was also one of the worst ideas in recent history Trump wrote saying Bradley was responsible for the elimination of a tax shelter for real estate investments (He said the good parts of the bill could be attributed to Reagan)This lacks context As governor Vice President Pence did make the largest income tax cut in Indianas history  but he didnt have a very high bar to overcome and it was a modest cut Prior to Pence there was only one time the income tax was cut without an offsetting increase in the 1970s Moreover Indianas individual income-tax rate was already  when Pence took officeIndianas individual income tax rate was 2 percent when it was established in 1964 then it was cut by 01 percent in 1979 It rose to 3 percent in 1984 in response to revenue losses from the 1979-1982 recession according to Purdue University economist Larry DeBoer Then the rate increased to 34 percent in 1988 and remained that way until Pence cut it by 02 percentage points to 32 percentAs governor Pence established a record of cutting taxes But  state lawmakers raised taxes as soon as Pence left office And compared to overall tax cuts in Indiana Pences income tax cut is far from the largest tax cut in state history Trumps claim that he would not benefit from the tax plan isnot credible Of course he has not released his tax returns so it is difficult to know for sure But he is certainly subject to the AMT  and the one recent tax return that has been leaked  shows that the AMT increased his tax bill from about $53 million to $365 million So at least in that tax year he potentially could have saved $31 millionEliminating the estate tax meanwhile is likely to benefit his heirs()Need some quick tips to assemble your fantasy lineup for Week 9 This is another big week for byes in the NFL with six

advice for your quick consumption Below youll find easily digestible nuggets from multiple fantasy experts addressing some of the critical situations fantasy owners will face from week to weekDig in And dominate  but the expectation is hell be playing Sunday when Arizona meets San Francisco Ellington had his best game of the season in the earlier meeting between the teams highlighted by his  For owners in a pinch Ellington should be a consideration vs the 49ers The Baltimore quarterback has  and is ready to go for the teams road game at Tennessee Flacco has been durable and with bye weeks a matchup against the Titans isnot a bad option A neck injury has forced San Francisco to place  ending his season Its an unfortunate turn of events for the 10th-year wideout Stop if youve heard this one before but Reeds status is not good and he could miss several weeks with a hamstring injury When Reed is healthy hes great to have on a team But more often than not Reed has been banged up and been more trouble than hes worth Hes most certainly headed toward my do-not-draft list in 2018 Sidelined by an ankle injury the past two games Sanders has recovered and  for Denver when it visits Philadelphia The Broncos have been stagnant offensively so Sanders return is welcomed in a big way New York looks like it will get back Shepard in Week 9 Shepard has been working his way back from an ankle injury He  and is in line to play vs the Rams For Shepard owners he seems like a solid play In a horrible turn of events for Houston the rookie quarterback  in practice Thursday ending his season Not only does it impact the Texans playoff pursuits but in fantasy circles it reduces the value for DeAndre Hopkins and Will Fuller But not this week play both wideouts despite the situation The No 5 overall pick has been a full participant in practiceand when Tennessee hosts the Baltimore Ravens Davis was a trendy pick on draft day but has been a non-factor for the first half of the season because of a hamstring injury For those owners in a pinch  For those owners just looking to add depth and potential to their roster Davis is a great get who could prove beneficial during the second half of the season Hes owned in less than 30 percent of ESPN leagues One of the big moves of the week saw Philadelphia acquire Jay Ajayi from the Miami Dolphins The Eagles have been utilizing LeGarrette Blount Wendell Smallwood Corey Clement and now-injured Darren Sproles since the outset of the season What does this mean in fantasy While  its hard to imagine the team will not begin working Ajayi into the lineup and get him acclimated While there could be a couple of so-so weeks  For Week 9 expectations should be tempered for both Blount and Ajayi as the Eagles host the Broncos Denver may not be as stingy on defense but still represents a tough matchup With Carolinas trade of Kelvin Benjamin Funchess would seem to be line for an increase in targets Funchess has only had one game in which hes received fewer than six targets and had a four-week stretch with 53 yards or more along with three touchdowns The Panthers offense has been in disarray for the past few weeks but a home game awaits against rival Atlanta Funchess will get opportunities and the Falcons have been susceptible to No 1 wideouts allowing five touchdowns the second-most in the NFL While Cam Newton and the offense havent been generating a lot of yards and points  vs the Falcons Richardsons ownership has skyrocketed 335 percent (overall owned in 43 percent of ESPN leagues) on the heels of his Week 8 performance in which he hauled in six receptions for 105 yards and two touchdowns for Seattle Richardson had shown glimpses all season but as Russell Wilson and the Seahawks offense has improved his role seems to be growing With a Week 9 matchup against the visiting Washington Redskins Richardson could be in line for another nice outing especially when you factor that Josh Norman will likely be assigned to covering Doug Baldwin A couple weeks back we cited a computer that was all-in on Nelson Agholor and Agholor did perform well Well that same  This is pretty much the long shot of long shots On just nine touches Booker is coming off his best game of the season (six carries for 40 yards and a TD) Denver is desperate for offense and enters Week 9 with a new quarterback CJ Anderson has not done a whole lot in recent weeks  Booker is owned in 4 percent of ESPN leagues Heres the biggest reason to not like Bookers Week 9 a matchup with an Eagles defense that has been very stingy against the run Heres the biggest reason to grab Booker even if its just to stash him on your roster  Food for thoughtThe NFLs trade deadline has moved a few faces into new placesFourth-year Patriots backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo was acquired by San Francisco to help the 49ers solve their issues under center facilitating the release of veteran passer Brian Hoyer in the process The Miami Dolphins traded running back Jay Ajayi to the Philadelphia Eagles perhaps causing a logjam at running back withLeGarrette Blount and the Houston Texans traded left tackle Duane Brown to the Seattle Seahawks giving quarterback Russell Wilson better protection on his blind side And then the Carolina Panthers despite being in the playoff hunt shipped star wideout Kelvin Benjamin to the Buffalo Bills  Thats a lot of movement for an NFL trade deadline  an event that has been called boring in the pastGaroppolo who has to grasp a new playbook wont be ready to start for another week or two but Tuesdays flurry of activity does affectAjayi and not in a good way Read on to find out whyHunt got off to a hot start but has struggled in his last three games with Mondays performance 22 carries for 46 yards plus three catches for 22 yards setting season-lows in yards per carry (21) and total yards (68) It was also thefirst timethis season the rookiedidnt top 100 yards of offenseThat should change this week Hunt will be going up against a Dallas Cowboys defensive front that has stopped only 20 percent of rushing attempts at or behind the line of scrimmage this season () andhas yet to stop a running

seasonExpect Carr and the Raiders to also have success with the deep ball Miamis secondary has allowed opposing receivers to catch a league-high five of 17 targets traveling 20 or more yards in the air four for touchdownsThis is great spot for Arizona coming off the bye and could make a great waiver-wire pickup being owned in just 30 percent of ESPN leagues heading into Week 9  Their opponent the San Francisco 49ers has allowed their quarterbacks to be  includingnine sacks and five takeaways in the past two games San Franciscos offense has also managed just 45 points per game on passing plays this year less than half the league average (99) and just 47 yards per play overall the fifth-lowest this seasonIts always tough benching a first-round pick but you may have better options on your roster this week because few wideouts have had success against the Jacksonville Jaguars secondary in 2017 The Jags have the No 1-rated pass defense per Football Outsiders the No 1 pass-coverage unit per Pro Football Focus and are allowing just  to a teams No 1 option at receiverAntonio Brown of the Pittsburgh Steelers has been the only wideout to surpass the 100-yard mark against Jacksonville this season but he did so without a touchdown DeAndre Hopkins of the Houston Texans scored but was held to just 55 yards receiving Overall the Jaguars are allowing wide receivers to score a league-low 64fantasy pointsper game in point-per-reception or PPR leaguesIts tempting to start Ajayi after  butCoach Doug Pederson isnt known for leaning on one rusher for an entire game Since 2016 Ryan Mathews is the only running back to surpass 20 or more carries in a game and they were both during the 2016 season This year the high is 16 achieved twice by Blount a significant departure for Ajayi who carried the ball 23 or more times on four different occasions in 2017  Plus Howie Roseman the Eagles executive vice president told reporters Blount remained No 1 on the depth chart Roseman told Turron Davenport of USA Today This is an opportunity that came to us where we thought we could add a good young player that is under contract for a couple years to our team Roseman said when he addressed the media on Tuesday Everyone has seen the way LeGarrette has run This just adds to the group LeGarrette continues to be the starter and we are just excited to have that group and add a good playerCrowder has his biggest game of the seasonin Sundays 33-19 loss to the Dallas Cowboys catchingnine of 13 pass attempts for 123 yards nearly doubling his total for the season But that was against a Dallas defense that ranked 20th against the pass per Football Outsiders This week he will have to face the leagues No 5 pass defense the Seattle SeahawksCrowder runs two-thirds of his routes from the slot where he will likely square off against Seattles slot corner Justin Coleman who is allowing a 564 passer rating to opposing quarterbacks who target him in coverage If Washington decides to line Crowder out wide he might have to faceshutdown corner Richard Sherman who is allowing just one reception for every 18 snaps in coverage the sixth-best mark at the position this season Neither option is a good one And thats if Kirk Cousins is even able to get the pass off as hell be playing behind a severely banged-up offensive line against the Seattle pass-rushChaos and violence turned to tragedy Saturday as hundreds of white nationalists neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members  planning to stage what they described as their largest rally in decades to take America back  clashed with counterprotesters in the streets and a car plowed into crowds leaving one person dead and 19others injuredHours later two state police officers died when their helicopter crashed at the outskirts of

Richmond and the US Attorneys Office in the Western District of Virginia said late Saturday they have opened a civil rights investigation into the deadly car crash The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice US Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated Records show Fields last lived in Maumee Ohio about 15 miles southwest of ToledoFieldss father was killed by a drunk driver a few months before the boys birth according to an

evacuated a downtown park as rallygoers and counterprotesters traded blows and hurled bottles and chemical irritants at one another putting an end to the noon rally before it officially beganDespite the decision to quash the rally clashes continued on side streets and throughout downtown including the pedestrian mall at Water and Fourth streets where the Challenger slammed into counterprotesters

people of good will  go homeElected leaders in Virginia and elsewhere urged peace blasting the white supremacist views on display in Charlottesville as ugly But President Trump known for his rapid-fire tweets remained silent throughout the morning It was after 1pm when he weighed in writing  We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for There is no place for this kind of violence in America Lets come together as oneIn brief remarks at a late-afternoon news conference in New Jersey to discuss veterans health care Trump said he was following the events in Charlottesville closely The hate and the division must stop and must stop right now Trump said without specifically mentioning white nationalists or their views We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred bigotry and violence on many sides On many sides Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke a Trump supporter who was in Charlottesville on Saturday quickly replied I would recommend you take a good look in the mirror & remember it was White Americans who put you in the presidency not radical leftists he wroteAsked by a reporter in New Jersey whether he wanted the support of white nationalists dozens of whom wore red Make America Great Again hats during the Charlottesville riots Trump did not respondEven as crowds began to thin Saturday afternoon the town remained unsettled and on edge Onlookers were deeply shaken at the pedestrian mall where ambulances had arrived to treat those injured by the car   Chan Williams 22 was among the counterprotesters in

Halliday 20 said It all happened in two secondsSaturdays Unite the Right rally was meant to protest the planned removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E Lee The city of Charlottesville voted to remove the statue earlier this year but it remains in Emancipation Park formerly known as Lee Park pending a judges ruling expected later this monthThey were met by counterprotesters at the base of a statue of Thomas Jefferson who founded the university One counterprotester apparently deployed a chemical spray which sent about a dozen rallygoers seeking medical assistanceOn Saturday morning people in combat gear  some wearing bicycle and motorcycle helmets and carrying clubs sticks and makeshift shields  fought one another on downtown streets with little apparent police interference Both sides sprayed chemical irritants and hurled plastic bottles through the airA large contingent of Charlottesville police officers and Virginia State Police troopers in riot gear were stationed on side streets and at nearby barricades but did nothing to break up the melee until about 1140am Using megaphones police then declared an unlawful assembly and gave a five-minute warning to leave Emancipation ParkThe worst part is that people got hurt and the police stood by and didnt do a g------ thing said David Copper 70 of Staunton VaState Del David Toscano (D-Charlottesville) minority leader of Virginias House praised the response by Charlottesville and state policeAsked why police did not act sooner to intervene as violence unfolded Toscano said he could not comment But they trained very hard for this and it might have been that they were waiting for a more effective time to get people out of Emancipation Park he saidBy early afternoon hundreds of rallygoers had made their way to a larger park two miles to the north Duke speaking to the crowd said that European Americans are being ethnically cleansed within our own nation and called Saturdays events the first step toward taking America backWhite nationalist leader Richard Spencer also addressed the group urging people to disperse But he promised they would return for a future demonstration blaming Saturdays violence on counterprotestersIn an interview Spencer said he was beyond outraged that police had declared the planned rally an unlawful assemblyI never before thought that I would have my country cracking down on me and on free speech he said We were lawfully and peacefully assembled We came in peace and the state cracked downHe said that counterprotesters attacked rallygoers but also acknowledged that maybe someone threw a first punch on our side Maybe that happened I obviously didnt see everythingBy 11am several fully armed militias and hundreds of right-wing rallygoers had poured into the small downtown park that was to be the site of the rallyCounterprotesters held Black Lives Matter signs and placards expressing support for equality and love as they faced rallygoers who waved Confederate flags and posters that said the Goyim know referring to non-Jewish people and the Jewish media is going downNo Trump No KKK No fascist USA the counterprotesters chantedToo late f-----s a man yelled back at themMichael Von Kotch a Pennsylvania resident who called himself a Nazi said the rally made him proud to be whiteHe said that hes long held white supremacist views and that Trumps election has emboldened him and the members of his own Nazi groupWe are assembled to defend our history our heritage and to protect our race to the last man Von Kotch said wearing a protective helmet and sporting a wooden shield and a broken pool cue We came here to stand up for the white raceNaundi Cook 23 who is black said that she came to Saturdays counterprotests to support my people but that shes never seen something like this beforeWhen violence broke out she started shaking and got goose bumpsIve seen people walking around with tear gas all over their face all over

                             Brown reported from Washington Jack Gillum and Sarah Larimer in Washington contributed to this reportPresident Trumps visit to Saudi Arabia  the first stop on his first overseas trip beginning Friday  is designed to solidify what the administration envisions as its premier partnership in the Arab and Muslim world effectively anointing the kingdom as Islams political as well as religious leaderDuring two full days in Riyadh Trump plans to sign bilateral military economic and counterterrorism agreements with the Saudis signaling an end to what both Riyadh and Washington have called the estrangement of the Obama yearsGiven the turmoil in Washington the journey may offer a welcome break for the besieged administration Nearly every senior White House adviser will be aboard Air Force One on Friday afternoon for the more-than 12-hour flight to RiyadhBut after touting the tour as an opportunity for what aides call Trumps disruptive style to shake up the world in a positive way the ongoing news from home may end up being a major distraction to Trump and his hostsOver two days at the top of a grueling schedule the president will hold bilateral meetings and a summit with the six Persian Gulf states of the Gulf Cooperation Council At a lunch with leaders of more than 50 majority-Muslim countries from around the world  chosen and invited by Saudi Arabia  Trump will deliver what White House national security adviser HR McMaster called an inspiring yet direct speech on his vision for confronting radical ideology spreading peace and sharing the burdens of achieving bothOvernight stops in Jerusalem and the Vatican will follow completing a tour of the Muslim world the Jewish world and the Catholic world all in about four days a senior administration official said with a historic message of religious toleranceThe nine-day trip ends with visits to the headquarters of NATO and the European Union both in Brussels and attendance at a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations in Sicily Trump returns home on May27But the main focus from the beginning has been on the Saudi stop Planning began last fall shortly after Trumps election according to the senior official one of several who spoke on the condition of anonymity about the agenda when the kingdom made contact with Trumps adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner to say We really want to work with this administrationThey came back to us with several proposals we shared them with the president and Trump approved the official saidSince then although Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis have long experience with the kingdom Kushner has been the point man on Saudi Arabia and has held discussions with 31-year-old Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman MBS as he is known is the architect and prime force behind a plan to move the kingdoms culture and economy into the 21st century he visited Trump in the Oval Office in MarchNumerous Saudi watchers have expressed concern that Kushners affinity for MBS inserts the United States into the kingdoms fraught succession competition in which MBS is second in line behind Crown Prince Mohammed bin NayefOthers including a number of US officials who work on the Middle East are worried that the administrations effusive public embrace of the Saudis effectively declares Sunni Muslims to be the leaders of the Islamic world although many majority-Muslim countries have differences with the kingdom and about 15percent of the worlds Muslims are ShiiteDerek Chollet who handled the Saudi account for the Pentagon as assistant defense secretary for international security affairs in President Barack Obamas second term suggested that Kushner and MBS are naturally drawn to each other Both are scions of wealthy families  in Kushners case both his own and Trumps  and both have enormous power inversely proportionate to their young ages and levels of experienceOverall Chollet said theres a natural affinity between the Saudis and the Trumps They operate similarly with family members being close advisers a mix of public and private interests and not a lot of talk about human rightsTrump he said has an affinity for palm-lined palaces Im not joking This feels more natural to the Saudis than any other US administration  The House of Trump and the House of SaudAmong bilateral agreements expected to be inked on the trip is a major US-Saudi arms deal providing for the kingdoms purchase of new ships for its eastern navy a possible Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic-missile system helicopters and battle tanks Negotiations on virtually all of the purchases were begun under the Obama administration in some cases years ago Congress was notified in 2015 of  at a price of $115billionThe gulf states are expected to state their intention to develop a mutual defense agreement described as an Arab NATO building on a broader Saudi-led military alliance of Muslim countries announced two years ago that has never gotten off the groundBoth Obama and his predecessor George W Bush pursued efforts to unite the gulf states in a military pact that would make their systems interoperable and see them carry more of their own defense costs That idea has made little progress Against this difficult history Trump will try againTrump also expects to receive a major new financial contribution from the gulf states to what the United States considers its costly defense of these countries and the fight against the Islamic State With Kuwait Bahrain and Qatar already hosting US military bases several of the countries think they are contributing enough Others including Saudi Arabia find themselves cash-strapped as the result of the downturn in oil pricesThe Saudis welcome Trumps apparent lack of concern about their limits on free expression and other human rights problems and are looking for help in quashing last years US legislation that could hold them liable for legal damages related to the 9/11 terrorist attacks in which 15 of the 19 perpetrators were Saudi citizensBoth the United States and Saudi Arabia  which has recently signed deals with Russia to reduce oil production in a slow market  are expecting new trade and investment agreements with each otherSaudi leaders have declared themselves unperturbed by Trumps comments before and during the campaignTell Saudi Arabia and others that we want (demand) free oil for the next ten years or we will not protect their private Boeing 747s Pay up Trump tweeted in September 2014 As a presidential candidate Trump described the kingdom as run by a despotic regime that would eventually be overthrownOn the other hand according to financial disclosure forms filed by his campaign the Trump Organization  Saudi Arabias summer capital The companies whose creation suggested hotel deals but whose purpose was never specified were dissolved after the electionFour of them according to his financial disclosure filing last May were established on the same day in August that Trump told an Alabama rally crowd Saudi Arabia I get along with all of them They buy apartments from me They spend $40million $50million Am I supposed to dislike them I like them very muchIn the kingdoms view recognition of its leading role is long overdueTrumps visit is a historic trip by every measure Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said during a visit to Washington last week But then keep in mind that Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam Its the custodian of the two holy mosquesWe are your closest partner in the war against terrorism and extremism  We are the country that offered the Arab peace initiative to resolve the Palestinian conflict Jubeir said Saudi Arabia is a huge investor in the US economy and a huge trading partner of the United States and were the largest exporter of oil in the worldTo achieve the objectives that the president set out  whether in restoring Americas role whether in defeating [the Islamic State]  containing Iran  promoting peace  investment  trade and prosperity Saudi Arabia is keyThe kingdoms position at the top of Trumps travel list Jubeir said is not surprising Drew Harwell and Steven Mufson contributed to this reportCall it the benefit concerts most unlikely collaborationThe five living former US presidents

more beautiful than everyone putting their differences aside to help humanity in the face of catastrophe   xoxo Gaga (@ladygaga)  Obama has called on Democrats to send a message to the world that we

prejudice in our public life sets a national tone and provides permission for cruelty and bigotry The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to themHaving the rather insane job I have  talking about fake football  means  and I do notice patterns People regularly ask me to predict unpredictable things (Will the Dolphins throw more to Anthony Fasano this week) they tell me Im stupid (I will never forgive you for not foreseeing Samkon Gado) and they ask me about the weather This weekend was the NFLs first seaboard-wide bad-weather situation for 2017 and suddenly every fantasy football owner was First of all I dont know I cant tell you exactly how rain will affect an NFL game or your fantasy football players And second of all for my own teams I dont tend to panic over rain or even snow Only 30-plus mile-per-hour winds get my lineup-finger twitching If you have a choice between players who are comparable its fine to use rain as a tiebreaker But even if theres  that says on average bad-weather games tend to feature less scoring the bleak reality of fantasy is we cant know how  specific player will be affected Its a small sample size but take Sundays games It rained in Dallas/Washington San Francisco/Philadelphia Atlanta/Jets and Oakland/Buffalo Three of those games went over the Vegas totals and 49ers/Eagles came in two points shy Yes if you started Dak Prescott the temptation might be to blame weather So how did Jamison Crowder post his biggest day of the year Matt Ryan fumbled away a snap four separate times but Robby Anderson went bananas Correlation isnt causationIm not throwing up my hands and saying Well some rainy-game teams scored points last week so never worry about weather ever I just think its a difficult straight line to draw If youre more sensitive to the notion that elements will influence your fantasy players I guess go ahead and bench Dez Bryant for Brandon Coleman and see how that works out For me as I said everything but high wind is merely a lineup tiebreakerLets look at five moves to make in preparation for Week 9Im not sold on Collins as a special player Every time Nantz and Romo gushed Look at his speed Thursday night against the Dolphins all I saw was a running back who didnt have to slow down while running through huge creases While the Dolphins defensive line was racing to get the quarterback Collins would simply take a handoff and find laughably little resistance Weve been trying to intuit what the Ravens backfield means all season and until last week folks had been pestering me for not valuing Buck Allen more Collins is a game-flow-dependent banger who I dont think has been granted elite quickness by  But RB replacements are hard to find in fantasy If theres a chance that Baltimore changes its backfield approach and gives Collins 40-plus snaps per game you should add him  EzekielElliotts appeal of his six-game suspension  It looks like he may be done until Week 15 barring a last-minute stay that legal experts dont think is likely That will lead to hundreds of hours worth of speculation on whether you should acquire Alfred Morris or Darren McFadden and frankly  of them are addable in case one of them catches fire But as good as the Cowboys offensive line is Elliott is a transcendent talent and I dont believe either of the veterans behind him will produce as well In fact Id expect to see Dallas become more of a passing team Prescott is a preternaturally calm QB who hasnt yet come across an NFL situation he couldnt master and Bryant is a star Its asking a lot to get these guys for reasonable prices in a fantasy trade right now but in some leagues the Cowboys passing game may still be undervaluedIm not saying you have to ditch him no matter what If you cant get a sweetheart offer for Fuller  who has seven TDs on 13 catches  just ride him until he stops this crazy act But its a locked-down fact that he wont produce like this all year Its not debatable Hes not catching 23 TDs See if you can package Fuller with your third running back and grab Antonio Brown on his bye week I promise that if Brown stays healthy somehow he will muddle through and find a way to outpace the Texans No 2 receiver the rest of the wayI guess its hard to say that  Bryant owner  drop him but if you need a roster spot its probably time In  I told you to bench Bryant and add JuJu Smith-Schuster and JuJu responded with a 97-yard touchdown Sunday night plus six other grabs In his first seven games JJSS had been primarily a slot receiver against the Lions he had five catches for 55 yards lined up outside I like that The Steelers are off this week and maybe Bryant finds a way to regain his coaches trust but even at 20 years old Smith-Schuster just seems like a more mature reliable dudeSeattle acquired a new starting left tackle Duane Brown who alienated the Texans both by holding out of the seasons first six games for a bigger contract and for becoming one of the faces of the player-protest against  Plugging in a new lineman isnt a simple process theres new terminology new line-mates new audibles  so I cant guarantee that Brown instantly makes all Seahawks skill players better But hes good and it gives the entire offense more upside even if we cant be sure theyll  that upside As such Im okay stashing Thomas Rawls whos been dropped in most leagues but who played 36 snaps Sunday while no other Seattle RB topped 15 Id also be fine trying Paul Richardson or Tyler Lockett who are widely availableSusan Sell is a professor of political science at George Washington University who has carried out landmark research on international negotiations over intellectual property Below is her response to five questions about the intellectual property chapter of the which the Obama administration has been negotiating with trading partners behind closed doors A draft of the chapter was two days agoThe United States Trade Representative and the Obama administration have kept the treaty texts secret from the public However they have shared texts with 700 or so cleared advisers all of whom come from intellectual property rights holders industries Members of the Industry Trade Advisory Committee on Intellectual Property Rights have had access to texts all along These members include representatives of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America the Recording Industry Association of America the Entertainment Software Association as well as firms such as Gilead Sciences Johnson and Johnson Verizon Cisco Systems and General ElectricSelect members of Congress have had very limited access to the draft treaty texts After Thursdays leak of the intellectual property chapter it is obvious why the USTR and the Obama administration have insisted on secrecy From this text it appears that the US administration is negotiating for intellectual property provisions that it knows it could not achieve through an open democratic process For example it includes provisions similar to those of the failed Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA) and the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) that the European Parliament ultimately rejected The United States appears to be using the non-transparent Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations as a deliberate end run around Congress on intellectual property to achieve a presumably unpopular set of policy goalsSome of the most interesting information in the leaked chapter identifies those who are proposing or opposing particular provisions The United States (often with Australia sometimes Japan) has taken extreme hard-line positions For example only the United States and Japan oppose the objectives in the treaty (Article QQA2) that mention economic and social development maintaining a balance between the interests of rights holders and users protecting the public domain quality examination procedures and access to affordable medicines I was somewhat surprised to see how strongly other countries are pushing back against US demands especially on issues related to access to medicines Internet Service Provider liability damages and copyright in digital mediaSome provisions of the text resurrect pieces of SOPA and PIPA and ACTA that many found to be objectionable The entertainment industries (movies and music) championed these agreements and sought stronger protections in the digital realm These industries were stunned when SOPA and PIPA got killed Only the United States and New Zealand oppose a provision that would require compensation for parties wrongfully accused of infringement (QQH4) The United States is alone in proposing criminal procedures and penalties even absent willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright or related rights piracyOnly the United States and Australia oppose a provision limiting Internet Service Provider liability (QQI1) US copyright holders would like ISPs to be held liable for hosting infringing content The United States also proposes extending copyright to life plus 95 years for corporate-owned copyrights Hollywood consistently presses for longer copyright terms and it is doing so hereThe United States is proposing a number of provisions designed to strengthen and extend brand-name pharmaceutical companies monopoly privileges For example several provisions would support the pharmaceutical firms practice of ever-greening in which a firm will hold a patent on drug x in tablet form then later obtain a patent on drug x in a gel cap and later still obtain another patent on the same drug in capsule form This extends patent life on a known substance despite no new medical efficacy thus it delays generic competitionThe United States seeks patents for new uses of a known product (all other countries but Australia oppose this) The United States alone proposes damages for patent infringement of up to three times the amount of injury suffered The United States and New Zealand oppose compensation for victims of enforcement abuse (QQH44) The United States also proposes giving customs officials ex officio powers to seize goods in transit that are suspected of being counterfeit Several years ago European seizures of lawfully produced Indian generic drugs en route to customers in Africa and Brazil threatened to disrupt generic supply chains and India threatened to take its dispute over this practice to the World Trade Organization Other US proposals would create exclusive new rights over clinical trial data so that generic firms would be prohibited from using those results to prove efficacy and bioequivalence The United States also proposes patents for medical procedures Overall these provisions would reduce generic competition reduce access to medicines and raise drug prices This seems ironic in light of Obamas professed domestic commitment to affordable health careIf these provisions are widely publicized I expect vigorous debate over the implications of these measures Various activist groups are mobilizing already and I think they are hoping for another SOPA/PIPA/ACTA defeat In the short term I expect that the release of this text will increase Congressional opposition to extending Fast Track negotiating authority to President Obama Congress has already expressed displeasure at being shut out of this process When its members see how provisions that had been defeated in a domestic democratic and deliberative process in January 2012 have been included in TPP I suspect that they will not be happyROSARIO ARGENTINA  The childhood friends from Argentina had been planning the trip to New York City for yearsAs teenagers they had bonded in the halls and classrooms of theInstituto Politcnico a technical high school in

big debates about politics and soccer but religion Not really Were Catholics and we have Jewish atheist and Mormon friends Muslim friends too Our pain is for the innocent and unjust deaths of people

same school he had graduated from 30 years earlier and where Berlot is now a teacher The victims had been students in his computing classWhat happened affects us as if we were all of one body said Berlot 58 speaking to the press outside the school on Wednesday At this institution we create strong bonds  Its absolutely normal that former students get together for an asado [Argentine-style barbecue] and to talk about the schoolThe Iranian nuclear deal is bad and needs to be fixed or canceled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ahead of a visit to the United States where he is expected to meet President Trump and push for changesAn Israeli official who spoke on the condition of anonymity ahead of the discussions said the Israeli governments main concern is the sunset clause which sets expiration dates on Changes to those provisions are among several demands Netanyahu will present to Trump during their meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly according to a report Wednesday on Israel Army RadioIsraels opposition to the Iranian nuclear deal is not new but analysts say Netanyahu probably sees a new window of opportunity to change it Global concern over North Koreas nuclear program is mounting and Trump has repeatedly signaled a desire to kill the Iran dealThe new impetus comes as Israel nervously watches Iran and its proxy force Hezbollah build a presence in neighboring Syria where they are fighting in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad Netanyahu has accused Iran of building sites in Syria and Lebanon to produce missilesOur position is straightforward This is a bad deal Either fix it  or cancel it This is Israels position Netanyahu said in Argentina on Tuesday night as he toured South America before traveling to New York for the UN General AssemblyAccording to the agreements sunset clause after 10 years Iran will be able to increase the number of centrifuges it operates beyond the current limit of 5060 The centrifuges are used to enrich uranium Israel would like to see this time frame extended or made indefiniteOther restrictions including a 300-kilogram cap on Irans stockpile of low-enriched uranium last 15 yearsNetanyahu has said often that as the agreement runs in its current form it shortens the breakout time for any Iranian development of nuclear weapons After 10 years he has said this breakout time will have shrunk to zeroHowever the  in its opening paragraph Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek develop or acquire any nuclear weapons So if Iran waited 10 or 15 years for sunset provisions to expire before building a nuclear bomb it would still be breaking the accordAccording to the Army Radio report Netanyahu will also ask Trump to prevent Iran from conducting research in the nuclear field and developing advanced-stage centrifuges with much higher powerIn addition the report said Israel will demand that Iran cease developing long-range missiles and that a clause be added to the agreement to limit Irans support of organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah which Israel and the United States consider terrorist groupsSpokesmen for the Israeli Foreign Ministry and the prime ministers office declined to confirm whether Netanyahu would raise these issues with Trump But Yaakov Nagel former director of Israels National Security Council said in a radio interview that these demands are nothing new and are in keeping with Israels position from the beginning of negotiations over Irans nuclear programIsrael has not changed its position Nagel said Even when the agreement was signed we said there were three or four clauses that were really bad The deal that exists basically gives Iran the right to develop uraniumThe president must inform Congress every 90 days about whether Iran is complying with the nuclear agreement The next report is scheduled for Oct15Earlier this month the US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said the president has grounds to declare Iran noncompliant raising speculation about whether he intends to keep the United States in the pactTrump has also slammed the agreement which was reached two years ago between Iran on one side and the United States Russia China Britain France and Germany on the other It gave Iran relief from nuclear-related economic sanctions in return for curbs on Tehrans nuclear programIn July however following a meeting between Trump and his senior national security advisers his administration told Congress that Iran has been complying with the nuclear dealHaley pointed to breaches in the amount of heavy water  which is used in certain kinds of nuclear reactors  that Iran was allowed to have and its refusal to open up all its sites for inspection as grounds for declaring Iran to be noncompliantWith deep concern over North Koreas nuclear tests there is currently an opportunity to send a message over the Iranian threat said Yossi Kuperwasser a researcher at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs and a former director of the Ministry of Strategic AffairsIts clear that if we dont do anything Iran will become a new North Korea except more dangerous

Athletic Director Scott Stricklin said We are confident Coach Shannon will provide the proper guidance to the players and rest of staff during this time and we will begin a national search for the next head coachThe two parties are currently negotiating terms of separation the GatorsUniversity Athletic Association said in a news releaseAccording to reports this week Florida administrators had been looking into the possibility of firing McElwain with cause whichwould let the school avoid paying the 55-year-old coach the full amount $1275 million left on his contract On Monday McElwain had said that Gators players and family members had received death threats amid a disappointing start to the season but the school announced that it could find no substantiation for thoseclaimsFlorida

perpetrator was an Uzbek immigrant who  in a hijacked beer truck hitting 19 pedestrians before crashing his vehicle into a department store Five of his victims died including an 11-year-old girlIn London  plowed into a throng of tourists on Westminster Bridge in a rented SUV then jumped out and stabbed a police officer before he was fatally shot In Barcelona the driver was a radicalized 22-year-old who left a quarter-mile trail of carnage Over the past year the same scene has played out at least seven times in Western cities from  to a hockey arena parking lot  In the wake of Tuesdays truck rampage in Lower Manhattan investigators were piecing together a basic narrative that has now become distressingly familiar  rented vehicle soft target homegrown perpetrator armed with a crude weapon and the simplest of plansWith the Islamic States all but finished as a military force in Iraq and Syria terrorism by vehicle is now firmly entrenched as the preferred choice for the groups scattered followers and sympathizers outside the war zones of the Middle East The results of the Halloween attack underscore the reasons for its popularity terrorism experts say The tactic requires no special skill or instruction or formal membership in a terrorist group And it is nearly impossible to prevent or stop  Cities are filled with pedestrians and streets are filled with automobiles and you cant realistically separate them said  a terrorism expert and senior analyst at Rand Corp Look at it from the perspective of the perpetrator You dont have to take on the risk of enlisting confederates or entering a conspiracy You dont have to apply for a firearm permit or learn to make a bomb All you have to do is get behind the wheelA day after the New York attack investigators concluded that suspect Sayfullo Saipov spent weeks preparing for the assault choosing a route sure to be crowded with bicyclists and joggers and arranging the rental of a small Home Depot truck But like the suspects in other similar attacks he appears to have little if any training or direct contact with foreign terrorists Instead he is believed to have followed a detailed template distributed broadly over multiple Islamic State social media accounts in recent monthsThose instructions have typically included advice on how and where to obtain a vehicle as well as tips on choosing the right location for an attack One such article posted in Rumiyah  the Islamic States online magazine  said the ideal vehicle should have a raised chassis for clearing curbs and barriers and should be fast in speed or rate of acceleration to ensure maximum momentum before strikingThe truck allegedly driven by Saipov traveled at a high rate of speed on a Lower Manhattan bike path and appeared to specifically target bike riders and pedestrians John Miller the New York Police Departments deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism told reporters Wednesday The rampage ended when the truck collided with a school bus injuring still more people Saipov was shot and wounded shortly after he emerged from the vehicle brandishing what turned out to be a pellet gun and a paintball pistol police saidThe rising popularity of the truck tactic in recent months prompted the federal Transportation Security Administration this spring to issue guidance to rental companies nationwide urging managers to report any suspicious behavior by clients such as unusual or unexplained modifications to reinforce a vehicles front bumper and frame according to the official memo released in May The NYPD has passed along similar warnings to local rental companies and dispatched officers to scores of them over the past two years to talk about the growing potential for using trucks as terrorist weapons  We did extensive outreach to the truck rental business Miller said at a news conference As added insurance in the hours after Tuesdays attack New York police parked additional sand trucks across side streets along the route of the annual Halloween parade scheduled for later that eveningIn practice the chances of disrupting a plot at a rental counter have always been small US officials and terrorism experts acknowledge Despite his reported preparations for Tuesdays attack Saipov had no history of serious crime or known association with terrorist groups He had made a living as an Uber driver and had passed the companys background checks an Uber spokesman saidPrivately some longtime terrorism analysts express surprise that the number of such attacks has not been higher given the simplicity of the plots and the difficulty of gaining prior warning about them Indeed the shift to simpler tactics and cruder weapons in recent months has meant far fewer opportunities in general to detect and thwart a terrorist operation in advance Matthew Levitt a former Treasury Department counterterrorism official said in testimony in September to the House Financial Services CommitteeWhile al-Qaedas Sept 11 2001 attacks on New York and Washington cost an estimated half-million dollars and involved dozens of operatives traveling across international borders todays typical attack involves a single self-radicalized homegrown actor and costs as little as $100  and sometimes nothing at all Levitt saidIn Great Britain and France knives and cars are two of the most commonly used weapons in small-scale attacks he said Both are unsophisticated readily available and often involve no costs at all since they are already in the possession of the attackers  The lack of formal membership in a militant group or even a direct link with foreign terrorists  overwhelming the case in the vehicle attacks committed in Western cities over the past year  makes the task of prevention harder still experts say As it faces new difficulties dispatching trained recruits abroad the Islamic State has deliberately pursued a strategy of appealing to loners and the broken  malcontents misfits those with mental disorders  to carry out acts in its name said Rands JenkinsWhile the personal circumstances that motivated Tuesdays attack are not fully understood nearly all the recent instances of terrorism by vehicle involved troubled men who had never belonged to the Islamic State but sought membership posthumously in an act of what Jenkins called prestige suicideISIS today is signaling that you can become a member just by taking action he said ISIS has no investment in this person other than in sending out the appeal If you carry out the attack and claim it is ISIS then you become a member ex post facto In the mind of the perpetrator it means your action has status rather than just being some loser taking out his frustrations on the worldFor the tiny oil rich nation of Qatar Al Udeid Air Base home to more than 10000 US service members has long been something of an insurance policyNow the Qataris at odds with their neighbors and under fire from President Trump on Twitter are anxiously waiting to see if that policy pays offTrump on Tuesday sided with a powerful block of Arab countries led by Saudi Arabia in accusing Qatar of funding terrorists and cozying up to Iran During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology Trump said in morning tweets Leaders pointed to Qatar  look  The president was responding to a regional crisis that began on Monday when Qatars Persian Gulf neighbors severed economic and political ties with their neighbor in a move designed to punish the tiny nationDespite the tough rhetoric US military officials said that planes continued to take off from Al Udeid in support of US military operations in Iraq Syria and AfghanistanThats exactly how Qatar planned it  perhaps Qatars greatest leverage in its ongoing dispute both with Trump and its larger Gulf neighbors The air base which has hosted US military aircraft for more than 15 years is considered a marvel with some of the longest runways in the Middle East and sophisticated hangars that rise like mountains from the flat desert floorThe base gives them a sense of confidence said Hardin Lang a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress It has made the Qataris feel as though they are integrated into a wider US security posture in the region In the past they may have seen this as check on the escalation of intra-Gulf squabbles because we need that capabilityFor the US military which is supporting Iraqi troops assaulting Mosul and readying a major push into Raqqa the Islamic States de facto capital in Syria the base has never been more importantIts not just the facility said former defense secretary Robert M Gates in a recent appearance in Washington Its the freedom of operation Qatar is the only country in the region that allows us to land B-52s and put B-52s at their base at Al Udeid We have run operations out of there for a dozen yearsThe US military began moving into Al Udeid not long after the Sept 11 terrorist attacks when Saudi Arabia asked the Americans to leave Moving to Qatar offered the US military a way of spreading risk across the regionA lot of it was we didnt want to be exclusively reliant on one country said Andrew Bowen a Middle East expert at the American Enterprise Institute We dont ever want to be dependent on the whim of any one any Gulf statePresident Trumps first address to the United Nations the world body he once said risked becoming an irrelevant salon will be a test of his America First agenda on global engagement climate change and North Korea but one topic  Iran  looms largestTrumps speech on Tuesday and a series of meetings he will hold next week with foreign leaders gathering here at the annual UN General Assembly are freighted with expectations that the US leader wants to pull away from the Trump faces an Oct 15 deadline to say  with terms of the deal and whether he considers the agreement to be in the US national interest His administration has recently signaled that he is likely to say no raising the specter of renewed US sanctions and the possibility that the deal would fall apartYoull see what Im going to be doing very shortly in October  when asked about his decision The Iran deal is one of the worst deals Ive ever seen Certainly at a minimum the spirit of the deal is just atrociously keptThe president added that the Iran deal is not a fair deal to this country Its a deal that should have never ever been made  We are not going to stand for what they are doing with our country Theyve violated so many different elements but theyve also violated the spirit of that dealMost who will be in the audience for Trumps speech disagree The European Union one of the architects of the deal hopes to hold a meeting of the signatories including Iran on the sidelines of the General Assembly sessionThis agreement is a very important agreement UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres said Wednesday It contributed to an important de-escalation at the moment and it is a factor of stability And its my opinion that all parties should do everything possible for this agreement to be preservedWhite House officials sketched out an ambitious series of events for Trump including bilateral meetings Monday with French President Emmanuel Macron and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin NetanyahuTrump is expected to focus on Irans destabilizing behavior including its violation of the sovereignty of nations across the Middle East  The president also will have lunch with Guterres and hell meet with leaders of Jordan the Palestinian Authority the United Kingdom Egypt Turkey Afghanistan and Ukraine And Trump will hold a trilateral dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in to discuss North Koreas nuclear weapons threatWhile Trumps debut on Tuesday is perhaps the most highly anticipated moment the UN gathering is also notable for who will not be there  Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinas Xi Jinping who are skipping this years meeting Aung San Suu Kyi the de facto head of Burma also will not attend amid a spate of government-backed ethnic violence in that country that has drawn  Trump has been a skeptic of international organizations such as the United Nations and NATO He pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement and an Asia-Pacific trade accord promoting a foreign policy aimed at limiting US interventionism abroad in favor of domestic prioritiesYet Trump administration officials said the president and his team are intent on having a strong presence and demonstrating leadership in New York on issues including terrorism trade and human rights Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will join Trump in the US delegation No one is going to grip-and-grin UN Ambassador Nikki Haley said of handshake photo-ops The United States is going to work  This is a time to be serious and its a time for us to talk out these challenges and make sure theres action that follows itAs he did with NATO Trump has pressed the United Nations for reforms and Haley emphasized that the administration has seen improvements She said the world body has moved away from focusing on the commas and the periods of toothless resolutions and begun taking stronger actionsShe cited recent decisions by the global body to enact sweeping economic sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic weapons program Haley said the sanctions will hurt Pyongyang but quickly added that if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un does not end his provocative missile and nuclear tests the United Nations will run out of optionsHaving said that I have no problem kicking it to [Defense Secretary James] Mattis because I think he has plenty of options she said alluding to military powerThe administration has options on Iran too which has colored Trumps engagement with US allies and partners since his surprise victory in NovemberChampions of the Iran nuclear deal were reassured when Trump twice acted to certify Iranian compliance Those notifications required by Congress were taken as a sign that Trump might complain about the deal but would not rip it up as he had pledged to do as a candidate Now administration officials are telling allies they want to strengthen the deal at the leastHaley recently said the deal cannot be too big to fail no matter the heavy investment of important US allies in keeping it intact And Tillerson said Thursday that Iran is clearly in default of expectations and responsibilities under the deal an assertion that Iran and European allies dispute The UN nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency said this month that Iran is playing by the rulesTrump is expected to cite Iranian ballistic missile activity and alleged Iranian support for terrorism and other activities as evidence that Iran is violating the spirit of the dealPresident Trump has made it clear to those of us who are helping him develop this policy that we must take into account the totality of Iranian threats not just Irans nuclear capabilities Tillerson said Thursday He quoted from the preface to the deal formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA The preface says that signers anticipate that full implementation of this JCPOA will positively contribute to regional and international peace and securityThe Trump administration is arguing that those words convey obligations to Iran to curtail activities that would harm international peace and security In our view Iran is clearly in default of these expectations of the JCPOA through their actions to prop up the Assad regime to engage in malicious activities in the region including cyber activity aggressively developing ballistic missiles Tillerson saidOn Twitter Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the deal is not renegotiable and said a better deal is pure fantasyAbout time for US to stop spinning and begin complying just like Iran Zarif wroteIn March 2016 Pat McCrory was the clean-shaven face of a conservative revolution in North

of millions of dollars in tourism and tax revenue  despite stemming from a governor who campaigned on a pro-business platformAs The Washington Posts By one estimate HB2 has cost the state between $77 million and $201 million in tourism and tax revenue (a number of businesses also canceled expansion plans in the state because of the law) and according to a North Carolina group that recruits and

system should operate  having people purged due to political thought he saidFour Arab nations led a diplomatic break with Qatar on Monday moving swiftly to isolate the small but influential country in a feud that stunned the Middle East and divideda coalition of monarchies that the United States had hoped to rally tofight the Islamic State and counter Iran The countries  Gulf Cooperation Council members Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain along with Egypt  released coordinated statements accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups and saying that as a result they were cutting links to the country by land sea and air Other countries including Yemen later joined the four-nation bloc in severing ties with Qatar which hosts a forward base for the US militarys Central Command and is home to the widely watched Al Jazeera television networkThe feud the most serious in decades among the Persian Gulf monarchies has been simmering for years as Qatar has sought to project its influenceacross the region including backing the Muslim Brotherhood and Islamist fighters in Libya and Syria But theflaring tensions raised fears of another destabilizing conflict in a region already grappling with three civil wars andjihadist insurgencies on several fronts The diplomatic break also complicated US efforts to rally Arab and Muslim leaders to form a united front against Sunni extremists and Iranian influence That had been the principal reason for  the Saudi capital last month a trip that the president and his allies had hailed as a success     But observers in the Middle East warned that the tripalso amountedto a tacit endorsement of Saudi Arabias frequently domineering and sharply contested leadership in the Middle East and was likely to aggravatelocal rivalries and disputes Saudi Arabia is often accused of indirectly fueling militant views through its rigid Wahhabi brand of IslamI do think its fair to say that it emboldened Saudi Arabia and the UAE to reshape the region and the immediate neighborhood in ways that they had wanted to do for a long time said Karen Young a senior scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington which receives funding from the United Arab Emirates I think its because they saw an opening in American policy  that Trump would support them in efforts that could be perceived as counterterrorismQatars Foreign Ministry called the measures unjustified in a statement and said the decision to sever ties was a violation of the countrys sovereignty and one based on claims and allegations that have no basis in factThe Indian Ocean nation of Maldives also joined the break with Qatar But two other Persian Gulf states Kuwait and Oman which have frequently played mediating roles in Arab disputes did not announce any Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis traveling in Australia on Monday said the feud would not affect the US-led coalition fighting Sunni extremist groups in the Middle East The United States uses bases in several of the countries to launch air operations against the Islamic State group The US headquarters for the air war is at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar  What were witnessing is a growing list of irritants in the region that have been there for some time and obviously they have now bubbled up to a level that countries decided they needed to take action in an effort to have those differences addressed Tillerson saidOther nations with strategic ties in the region including Turkey and Russia quickly urged efforts to keep the diplomatic spat from wideningWhile the other Persian Gulf states have expressed anger over Qatars ties toIran with which it shares a massive natural gas field others in the region also maintain strong economic relations with Tehran The UAE is Irans biggest non-oil trading partner and Oman conducts an open dialogue with the government thereFar deeper is the dispute over Qatari support for political Islam in particular  In its early days the Trump administration prepared an executive order designating the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization only to pull back after a number of Arab leaders including Jordans King Abdullah II advised against it Egypt and Saudi Arabia have long pushed for Qatar to expel Brotherhood figures as well as members of the Palestinian militant group Hamas who live there Qatar has also drawn the ire of Arab neighbors for its sponsorship of the Al Jazeera television channel which hosts frank discussions of politics in the region while amplifying Qatars pro-Islamist views And Qatar is among several gulf countries including Kuwait Bahrain and Saudi Arabia accused in recent years of looking the other way as their citizens privately sent money to Islamist militants abroad including in Syria  The statements by the Arab countries Monday however went far beyond the usual criticism of Qatar for supporting Sunni extremists accusing it of interference in conflicts from Yemen to the Sinai PeninsulaA battery of charges included some that appeared implausible Saudi Arabia for instance accused Qatar of supporting Yemens Houthi rebels  even though Qatar has participated in a Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis who have ties to IranBahrain a stalwart ally of Saudi Arabia accused Qatar of financing groups associated with Iran to subvert and spread chaos in BahrainThe first signs of the intensifying feud emerged soon after Trumps visit to Saudi Arabia In the days that followed the Saudi government and its allies attacked Qatar for statements  that were sympathetic to Iran and militant groups such as Hezbollah and HamasQatar later said that the statements which were posted on the state news agencys website were fake and that the agencys site had been hacked That explanation however did not stop the attacks on Qatar from media outlets loyal to the Saudi or Emirati governmentIt remained unclear what exactly led the Arab states to move so suddenly and forcefully to isolate Qatar Other experts suggested that the timing of the move might be related to the upcoming release of an FBI report on the alleged Qatari hacking The Qatari government had invited the bureau to assist in an investigation of the incident And last month a Washington-based think tank the Foundation for Defense of Democracies which has been supportive of the UAE and at the forefront of efforts to cancel the Iran nuclear deal held a day-long meeting in which a series of speakers were sharply critical of Qatar The keynote speaker was former defense secretary Robert M Gates who described Qatar as a strategic US ally but expressed concern over its apparent support for groups that the United States considers terroristsBut at the heart of the dispute is Qatars refusal to fall in line behind Saudi Arabia and its partners said Mishaal Al Gergawi the managing director of the Delma Institute a political consultancy in the UAENow that you have a post-Arab Spring reconstitution of some kind of alliance he said there is really little room for dissent on this side of the gulf For Qatar a peninsula nation that shares its only land border with Saudi Arabia the effects of the partial blockade could be catastrophic as airlines in the four Arab countriesannounced that they were halting flights and as residents flocked to supermarkets tohoard supplies There was also growing uncertainty among the large community of Egyptian expatriates who had fled Egypts dismal economy and found work in Qatar Estimates of the number of Egyptian workers in Qatar range from 180000 to 300000Rania Dorrah a 38-year-old Egyptian interior designer said she and her husband were concerned that they would not be able to renew their work visas because of the crisis Her husband an accountant tried to renew his visa Monday but was told to come back laterbecause everything has been halted for now she said  What I fear the most now is to return to Egypt without notice and this means returning back to nothing she saidAbsolutely nothing    Dan Lamothe in Sydney Heba Farouk Mahfouz in Cairo and Brian Murphy and Anne Gearan in Washington contributed to this reportOn Monday North Koreas foreign minister Ri Yong Ho declared that Pyongyang sees President Trumps statements on Twitter as  and threatened to shoot down USmilitary aircraftin international airspace The intensifying crisis surrounding the North Korean weapons program makes the risk of a a situation in which one side misinterprets an action by its rival as a first step toward war higher than ever before  Here are four potential paths to miscalculations of varying degrees All are avoidable Kim Jong Un has threatened to test a hydrogen bomb as the next step in his nuclear strategy South Africa in the 1980s had  without the showstopper H-bomb  but the circumstances were somewhat different and the strategy was kept secretSouth Africa had developed a rudimentary nuclear arsenal completingsixenriched-uranium bombs by 1989 The South African strategy was to try to  to come to its aid should pro-Soviet forces invade from the north The strategy was never tested as  ended the South African nuclear program upon taking office in 1989But critics of the plan point out that a South African nuclear test might have had the opposite effect at the time further antagonizing the Reagan administration and expanding the existing rift between Pretoria and Washington over South Africas apartheid regimeWhat would a North Korean H-bomb test lead to Instead of deterring the United States it might just be the tipping point leading to a US first strike against North Korea Previous administrations failed to curtail North Koreas nuclear program passing this hot potato down to the Trump administration But Trumps use of  has emerged as a   A recent strand of nuclear proliferation studies looks at the importance of a  perception and  underlining the importance of a leaders psychological makeup This type of provocative and aggressive talk may work on the campaign trail but can be particularly dangerous in the realm of nuclear diplomacy  especially when Trump hurls insults at the  Kim The North Koreans simply dont get Trump and are trying to  of his statementsHeres the danger North Korea could misinterpret Trumps statements as an impending first strikeThe importance of beliefs and perceptions is also salient when considering Trumps position and tough talk on another nuclear issue  Despite reports that Iran is not in material breach of the agreement Trumps preconceived beliefs about the agreement greatly impact his policy toward it Trump seems to think that the agreement should be undermined or terminated despite evidence that it is achieving its goal of inhibiting the Iranian nuclear program Since the 1980s the US military has spent about  to develop the technological capability to shoot down ballistic missiles This effort has produced different systems for different missiles including the  (GMD) interceptors developed to shoot down incoming intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and the  and  systems developed to shoot down shorter-range missilesBut shooting down missiles is hard to do and the GMD interceptors are relatively inaccurateThe THAAD and the Aegis systems have a better test record than the GMD interceptors but none of the three has been actively used in an actual war In theory theUnited States could use the THAAD and Aegis  to shoot down North Korean demonstration missiles launched over the PacificBut if the intercept fails it could  causing allies to lose faith inAmerican security promises  and perhaps lead to new challenges from rivals Such a failure could also lead to a miscalculation on North Koreas side if Pyongyang wrongly assumed that the intercept was an act of war   North Korean statements have a particular internal logic of their own which outsiders tend to miss completelyIn early August North Korea stated that it was carefully examining the operational plan for making  at the areas around Guam Analysts interpreted this as a threat to launch missiles around Guam targeting the international waters surrounding the islandThis threat was bad enough but the North Koreans were not in fact threatening to hit the island itself Global media reports however depicted the North Koreans as threatening the island  The difference between the two scenarios is rather acute One entails North Korean missiles falling  US territory and the other depicts them hitting Guam directlyWhats important is that administration officials are getting it right  even if the media dont account for these important nuances Public concern will not lead to a strategic miscalculation on the USs part though it may impact the crisis in two other opposing ways It can enhance the pressure on the White House to react to further North Korean provocation or more likely it can increase the pressure to find a diplomatic solutionThe more concerning question is whether the Trump administration and the  are equipped to handle the North Korean crisis US officials are by now skilled at unpacking Pyongyang speak Senior officials like Defense Secretary  and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson repeatedly stress the focus on  pressure rather than the military option but is this enough to de-escalate the current crisisWords alone are not likely to trigger a nuclear exchange but they can surely lead to further escalation as we are witnessing now Each of these four paths is a mere possibility  and none are particularly likely to occur The North Koreans probably realize that detonating a thermonuclear device in the Pacific could lead to war and take Trumps aggressive rhetoric with some grains of salt (despite Pyongyangs declarations to the opposite)Even if the US tries and fails to shoot down a North Korean missile war will not automatically break out But it might And all these paths underline the importance of prudence and diplomacy  and the need for balanced farseeing statesmanship The question is can Trump and Kim deliver the goodsAs Donald Trump embarks on his first presidential trip to Asia will we see a clearer strategy emerge on US foreign policy in Asia Security issues related to North Korea along with US trade interests will top the discussion agendaIn the first 10 months of the Trump presidency  from the president and his advisers have created

the upcoming trip stated that Trumps travels would demonstrate continued commitment to the alliances and partnerships of the United States in the regionIn a part of the world where showing up and

no secret of its wish to rein in the  with China estimated at more than $300 billion in 2016Its an ambitious agenda a lot of miles and a lot of diplomacy for 11 daysTell me what you see as the most important issue in the Virginia governors race  Well I think the most important issue in the governors race here in Virginia is the economy Weve been losing tens of thousands of jobs  160000 jobs  in the last 10 years And the reason were losing jobs is because we havent done anything to improve the business climate in Virginia Weve been losing a lot of jobs to North Carolina as theyve ratcheted down their income tax all the way from 775 percent in 2010 to 549 percent today and theyre going lower And as that has happened jobs have been lost Weve been leaving Virginia going to North Carolina and other states and what I want to do about that is push through the biggest tax cut in Virginias history Reduce the top marginal income tax rate in Virginia from 5  sorry from 575  percent to 475 percent over the course of about a year   How would a reduction in the income taxes how would an elimination of an income tax encourage new businesses to start here   Well thats a great question The answer is this is that 80 percent of new jobs are created by small businesses and most small businesses are not incorporated They pay their taxes at the personal income tax rate So the only way to get off the back of business and the only way to let more businesses keep more of their money is to reduce the burden of state income taxes and that means that were going to have to we will have to reduce the income tax for everybody in Virginia which is good of course but that also means that were going to be able to let small businesses in particular keep more of their money and hire more people   One of your opponents in the primary Frank Wagner has suggested that cuts in the income tax would throw Virginias budget off balance and would threaten the bond rating What do you say about the potential negative impacts of a severe income tax reduction   Well a cut in the income tax and a cut in the states revenue would only jeopardize the bond rating if we didnt make up for those  that lost revenue  by reducing spending Now in Prince William County I led the county to becoming one of the few localities in the United States to have a triple triple-A bond rating status which means we are one of the few localities that has a triple-A bond rating status from all three of the major bond rating agencies and we did it while we cut spending We cut taxes as well and as we cut taxes to Prince William County we cut we cut spending and we cut spending so significantly in the first year that I controlled the budget that the average tax bills went down by over $400 on a single year And yet we gained after that we gained or triple triple-A bond rating status because we were also  as we cut taxes we cut spending Fenit Nirappil [000314] You mentioned earlier how Virginia is losing jobs to North Carolina One of the big arguments that Democrats in Virginia are making is that Virginia needs to lead the way as a socially progressive place and Virginia has been able to take jobs from North Carolina because it has been more socially progressive on issues like trans rights How does that fit into your economic vision for Virginia and do you agree with their logic   The transgender issue has nothing to do with economic development I know the Democrats would like to think so but its not Look of every of the five candidates who are running for governor only one  only one  has actually governed anything Ive governed the second largest state sorry the second largest locality in Virginia Prince William County for over 10 years And during that time I led Prince William County to be number one in job growth in Virginia and number three in the United States And we did that by a couple of things One you got to get off the back of business youve got to reduce unneeded regulations We cut in half the amount of time that it takes to open or expand a business of Prince William County Number two youve got to build adequate public infrastructure Youve got to have the necessary roads the necessary schools the necessary parks And thats important because at the end of the day businesses move into your community they move into your state if theres a high quality of life if you have adequate schools if you have great schools if you have adequate road infrastructure then theyll move into your community and theyll stay in your community because their employees and the management wants to live there Thats how you create business development inside the state and how we did it in Prince William County And then finally youve got to have a low tax burden Thats what I did in Prince William and thats what were going to do in Virginia It has nothing do with transgender rights or any of these socially social issues At the end of the day building business and causing business to come into our community takes those three elements It has nothing to do with with transgender issues   Going back to the issue of taxes a lot of times when there is discussion of tax cuts at a state level Democrats will frequently point to the example of Kansas and say look at the budget damages that happened there after Governor Sam Brownback shepherded through severe tax cuts Have you looked as examples places like Kansas and Louisiana Has that informed your thinking on tax cuts in Virginia   Not at all I mean I think look if youre going to have  and heres the difference between Ed Gillespie and me Ed wants to cut taxes without cutting spending You cant do it And if you if you try to cut tax bills while but you dont cut spending then you get yourself into a deficit situation a shortfall situation and that in fact does jeopardize the states triple-A bond rating status and causes a whole lot of problems My tax plan is dependent upon cutting spending First you cut spending Were going to have it across the board  10 percent cut in spending Ive done it before in Prince William County  even deeper than that in Prince William County It was done by Governor Wilder several years ago and we can do it again in Virginia By  by  zero-based budgeting requiring each of the department heads to come up [with] a list of cuts that we could choose from from the governors office and then putting those into place And if you cover your tax cuts with adequate spending cuts youre not going to be jeopardizing your bond rating status because youre not going to be headed into a deficit or shortfall situation   What are scenarios you see as right for spending cuts   Well I think that you know especially in the in the areas of in Medicaid for example and and and at VDOT There has never been a zero-based budgeting process done in the state of Virginia  never In Prince William County and other localities we do this in Prince William County every three years every department we have a zero-based budgeting analysis So youre going to find room for savings in every area of the state government in every department Some departments are going to cut more than others Some departments you might not cut at all such as the state police who have been underfunded but thats how you do it You take the decisions you require your administrator to identify the cuts They in turn push that into midlevel management and then further deeper down into the administration into the bureaucracy so that every member of government is looking for savings and looking for cuts Thats how we did it in Prince William County and thats how I intend to do it in Virginia   So since November to turn the our attention to national politics weve seen the Republican Party debating its future whether it should be the party of smaller government conservativism whether it should embrace a more populist message whether the role of big business in supporting the business wing of the party Where do you fall in the future of what the Republican Party should be   I think the Republican Party needs to embrace the blue-collar working-class Americans who have been struggling And one of the reasons that Trump was able to reach in and grab working-class Americans was because the Democratic Party had essentially turned their back on them And thats  I am I come from a working-class background my dad was a longshoreman and you know Im very much thats where my heart is And and so I see myself as kind of a new Republican a new style of conservative similar to Donald Trump but I am my own man You know Im not anti-union I do believe in reaching out and working with the working class And heres the other thing too that we have not done very well  as Republicans we have not been promoting career technical education This to you know weve been  this focus this over-focus on on everybody every kids got to get a get out and get a four-year degree a bachelors degree Well they are coming out of these colleges with mounds of student debt they cant find jobs We need to shift our focus and make it okay and make it something to be proud of you know youre a working-class person youve got a certification a working-class degree I mean on all the social issues Im very very conservative You know Im a leader on on illegal immigration Ive been doing that for 10 years Long before Donald Trump ever came up with it Ive been you know Im socially conservative I am conservative on all those issues But at the same time I do recognize that the Republican Party has grown tired and we have to reach in and weve got to grab new classes of people that we have previously been unable to grasp Ive been able to do that Thats the only reason Ive been able to win in Prince William County four times for 10 years the countywide-elected chairman of Prince William County because its 54 percent minority Ive been able to win large percentages of minority voters and thats what I intend to do as the Republican nominee for governor   I remember when I talked to you on the night of your reelection victory in November 2015 you mentioned you really made a point in my campaign to have an increasingly close relationship with minority voters and thats what Republicans need to do to win in Northern Virginia How is that going to play out in your gubernatorial race   Well its you know some people think that because you know if youre conservative on illegal immigration if youre conservative on heritage issues you know protecting the statue of Robert E Lee and things like that that you can never win minority voters as a Republican Ive proven that that is not true Because what happens is Republicans have failed to go into into minority areas and to campaign there and show people that you care and that youre there to listen You dont you dont go there to preach You go there to listen to what theyre saying and thats what Ive done I go every single year I go into minority churches and mosques and I  all over you know Prince William County Thats what Im going to be doing as a Republican nominee for governor And you cannot moderate your way to victory Thats what Ed Gillespie is trying to do Ed Gillespie thinks that he has to become a Democrat light that hes got to run away from the controversial conservative issues in order to win I know from governing and getting elected four times in Northern Virginia countywide thats not the way to do it You stand up for your beliefs You have to reach out and you have to communicate and you have to go and ask minority voters from every every walk of life what the issues are that theyre concerned about   Do you think the African American community in Richmond would embrace you when youve made Confederate and defending Confederate statues and Confederate heritage a centerpiece of your campaign or Latino communities in Fairfax when youve called for federal agents federal immigration authorities in schools   Yes And heres why You know what You know when we led a crackdown on illegal immigration in Prince William County in 2007 Naturally I knew there were going to be some consequences to that But over time what has happened is you know the greatest improvements to public safety in Prince William County occurred in minority neighborhoods the violent the violent crime rate went down all over Prince William County But especially in the poorer areas of Prince William County especially in the areas where there are a lot more minority residents And so we  and everybody thinks that if somebody is Latino that theyre not for immigration enforcement Thats not true Thats just an assumption that people make But if youre here illegally and you brought your your  in many cases people have waited decades to come into the United States legally and theyve done it the proper way That doesnt mean that theyre supporting someone who is coming over here illegally and cutting in line So thats that And then the second thing is this whether your white or your African American or your Hispanic or your Asian people are so fed up and theyre so tired of political correctness and thats ultimately what this removal of a statue in Charlottesville is all about Its political correctness gone mad and whether your white or black or Hispanic or Asian people are fed up with it and theyre tired of it And nobody thinks that we should be trying to erase history except for the radical lefties down in Charlottesville   How do you think the state should grapple with its history of slavery   Well I think that you know look I mean every every single society every  no matter what country somebody comes from or what state no matter their race or ethnicity we all are we have our heritage we have a history You know my family came to the United States you know from Scotland and other parts of Europe after the Civil War was over And Im very proud of the heritage Ive got You know I have a kilt for goodness sakes Im proud of my Scottish ancestry my Scottish heritage And I think that everybody should be able to be proud of their heritage and their history Everybody has scars on their history and their heritage Everybody has those warts on their heritage but you dont toss the baby out with the bathwater And yes it is true that slavery was legal in Virginia but it was also legal in a lot of Northern states as well And I think that Southerners and Virginians should be proud of their history and of course slavery was was was a was is a wart on our history but you know that doesnt mean that you thats not the totality of our heritage here in Virginia Theres a lot more to it than just slavery   But why have you made Virginia Southern heritage such a cornerstone of your campaign   Because I feel that you know you know when it came to that when I saw the city of Charlottesville voting to remove a statue of Robert E Lee that had been there since 1924 thats the result of political correctness gone mad And if if we dont stop it here its going to take off The the very councilors the city councilors in Charlottesville who said that those who voted for the removal of the statue of Robert E Lee said theyre coming after Thomas Jefferson Pretty soon youre going to have the statues of Robert E Lee Thomas Jefferson Stonewall Jackson removed from the city of Charlottesville Then it moves to Richmond then in moves to Alexandria and Petersburg and Williamsburg and then pretty soon weve lost all of these memories These symbols of our heritage and history and when we lose that in Virginia weve lost our identity And thats why I think its so important   How successful of a strategy is it to be to embrace Donald Trump in Virginia when he lost the state by five points   Well a couple of things I mean you know I did chair his campaign until October 10th of 2016 I know quite a lot about this I can tell you this One we knew in the campaign that as soon as Hillary Clinton chose Tim Kaine as her running mate it was going to be very very difficult to win in Virginia and partly because of that the campaign the Trump campaign was out-funded by the Hillary campaign in Virginia by seven to one They spent $21 [million] $22 million on the campaign in Virginia We spent $3 [million] Essentially the campaign the Trump campaign I had given up on Virginia because of the running mates status and everything else you know with Tim Kaine on the ballot Were not giving up on Virginia this time And Im not giving up on Virginia I never did give up on Virginia You know Ed did Ed Gillespie did And you know as soon as Trump you know in the aftermath of the Access Hollywood scandal he condemned him and just assumed he was going to lose I never lost faith even after I got removed from the campaign I stayed loyal   What is your response to Ed Gillespies contention that he would be able to better work with President Trump in the White House because he wasnt fired from the campaign as you were   Well he never  look Ed Gillespie never wanted anything to do with the Trump campaign He would never show up at a Trump rally Ed Gillespie never showed up to a single Trump rally He was one of the first Republican politicians in America to condemn President Trump and in the aftermath of the Access Hollywood scandal and that has not been lost That message has not been lost with the Trump administration Even after I got removed from the Trump administration from the Trump campaign I stayed loyal Mr Trump knows that And Im willing to work with him even to this day Ed Gillespie will not show up with Donald Trump he will not even mention his name The only person hell show up with is Mike Pence He wont show up with Donald Trump So you know Im Im willing to embrace the administration work with the administration Ive made that clear Ed Gillespie wont even touch Donald Trump   How much or how did the Trump campaign inspire your campaign   Well I mean you know there are a lot of things that are already similar between Donald Trump and myself I mean one of the reasons he selected me you know back in December of 2015 to chair his campaign  those similarities Very similar you know bluntly honest dialogue and you know I speak I speak my mind just the way it is and sometimes it doesnt always come out all that pretty and  but thats okay Thats what people want And illegal immigration you know I led the nations toughest crackdown on illegal immigration so there are already were some similarities there But Ive studied a lot of presidents throughout time I love history I have Ive wanted to lead ever since I was a little boy And Ive studied a lot of politicians over time to learn you know including Democratic ones The former editor of The Washington Post wrote a book  Ben Bradlee  called Conversations with Kennedy I remember reading that when I was a teenager and understanding John F Kennedys style and the way you know how he interacted with the press things like that I studied him I studied a lot a lot of people with Donald Trump There were some things that I just thought were absolutely brilliant And one of the things  perhaps the most important thing  was he never backed off when he was attacked by the press or by the left He just never he just kept going forward And I think that was that was a big lesson because once you start backing up once you start running in the opposite direction and cowering after the attacks its like blood in the water And then youre done I learned that from him  just keep doubled down dont back up   Why do you think your campaign hasnt been able to gain more traction in polls and campaign cash even after adopting techniques of the Trump campaign like being more blunt talking and not backing down   Well to a large extent people havent started paying attention to the campaign yet even during the the last polls that have been done the last poll was I guess was the CNU poll more than 50 percent of the voters are undecided Now heres the heres the thing that the the Quinnipiac poll which just came out last week  the Quinnipiac poll in December showed that among very conservative voters Ed had 30 percent of them I had four that was in December Now youve got to remember very conservative voters are very likely to vote in a Republican primary People who are somewhat conservative are not sure whether theyre Republicans or Democrats are probably not going to vote for Republican primary Well we went from 30 percent for Ed and 4 percent for me in December to last week here in April where Eds numbers actually declined among very conservative voters hes down to 28 and I moved up 15 points to 19 percent So now were at a 28-to-19 percent range here among voters who are likely to vote in a Republican primary And momentum is on my side And as people start delving into it and they start researching as the as the election gets closer to June 13th and then educating themselves about well who [they] dont want to vote for people who vote in Republican primaries are generally very conservative Theyre going to vote for the more conservative outspoken conservative candidate Even if I am more controversial than Ed Gillespie whos clearly an establishment person   One of the things that Donald Trump had going for him is that there was intense familiarity with him because of wall-to-wall cable TV coverage because he had a prime-time reality TV show that millions had watched Is it possible for Republicans to replicate his success down ballot without those kind of advantages or is he just a one-of-a-kind candidate and a one-of-a-kind campaign   Well its a very good question and I dont know the answer Were going to find out on June 13th But I think so because of the increasing role of social media and there is quite a lot of attention on this race by the mass media by The Washington Post and others It really is the only big political game in town in 2017 is the race for governor in Virginia in 2017 Theres a race in New Jersey too but its probably a foregone conclusion that the Democrats win that one So there is going to be an increasing amount of press attention on this race But heres the thing too that 2016 showed us  the increased importance of social media Social media is the great equalizer It doesnt cost a lot And I can get my message out there And when people go to vote theyre not going to be listening to some glib commercial that Ed Gillespie puts on television Theyre going to be doing their research Theyre going to be reading about this and theyre going to go to social media to get that done Theyre not going to be moved by [a] television commercial Ed has got $3 million in the bank You can bet your bottom dollar that over the next two months hes going to be running ad after ad after ad Well it didnt work for Jeb Bush Jeb spent $100  Jeb Bush spent a hundred  over $100 million and barely move the needle Ed Gillespie is going to try the same thing and Im betting that it will fail for him as well   Looking ahead to the general election campaign what would make you a better candidate against Ralph Northam or Tom Perriello   Im the only one whos won in Northern Virginia 400540 residents in a majority-minority county  Prince William County Not once not twice four times by increasing margins Im the only one has proven that he could do it Ed Gillespie he lost Prince William County in fact all of the Republicans have lost Prince William County Donald Trump lost Prince William County Ed Gillespie lost Prince William County Ken Cuccinelli lost Prince William County They all lost Prince William County Im the only one whos been able to win Im the only proven one the only one who has proven that he can win in Northern Virginia and Ive done it not by moderating myself to being a light Democrat like Ed has done Ive done it by staying strong on my issues my conservative issues and people even if they disagree with that they respect it because they know where youre going  youll lay out a very clear definition a very clear vision And if people want that they want certainty they want strength and thats what I offer   When Trump was blown out in Northern Virginia and when your race was more focused on pocketbook issues as opposed to social issues is it possible to win Northern Virginia or at least reduce the margins in Northern Virginia in the general election for governor   Well I think that you know clearly the emphasis on the issues changes you dont change your position on the issues but you know you know when I was running for  when I every every four times when Im running for chairman at large for Prince William County 450400 people you have to stick to the issues that people care about the most and then you know clearly you know coming into the general election theyre going to be a little bit different than what they are in the primary and were going to be emphasizing those especially the income tax cut to get more jobs in Virginia  people are very very concerned about the economy And and I can speak because Ive led on this issue Ive already cut spending Ive already been able to reduce taxes Ive already been able to build roads in Prince William County without increasing taxes The biggest road-building program in the state in fact even though were half the size of Fairfax County weve had we have a more robust larger road-building program in Prince William County under my leadership than Fairfax does and I think that says something   Assuming that the Republicans hold on to the House of Delegates and the Republicans win the governors mansion social issues will really be at play for the first time in four years On the issue of abortion do you support an exception for the life of a mother for the 20-week ban   No And heres why You know abortion is the deliberate taking of the unborn babys life Its the deliberate killing of the unborn baby If if if the mothers life is threatened and that she cannot be brought to full term for the for the birth of the baby and the baby has to come out early if the baby has to be born early and as a result of that the baby dies then thats in the hands of God But thats the difference between an abortion and an early birth is that you know it is possible to save the baby at five months Its possible to save the baby at four and a half months five months six months And but thats very different from an abortion where youre deliberately killing the baby Now thats the big difference By the way between Ed Gillespie and me you know I think there should be no exceptions for late term for a ban on late-term abortions Its a baby Its a baby Its clearly a baby And so how can you possibly justify the killing of that baby for whatever reason Ed Gillespie has got a different view Hes you know hes for you know exceptions for that you know for rape incest life of the mother Sounds reasonable But the problem is is that it destroys the entire prohibition because someone would just say or could say that they were raped or whatever several months ago and of course they wouldnt have to prove it And then the ban would be for nothing because we wouldnt be prohibiting late-term abortions   Lets transition to some personal questions Besides being governor what was your dream job growing up   To being chairman of the board supervisors  Im kidding You know I I I studied at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University Im very very interested in foreign affairs and international relations so I wanted to be a diplomat You know maybe being the ambassador of someplace You know I met my wife Maria in Japan when I was teaching English I love traveling I love you know other cultures and studying about them and so if there werent politics it would probably be you know working for the Foreign Service   When youre not doing your day job as a lawyer or attending county meetings or on the campaign trail what is your guilty pleasure  what do you do to unwind   Well we I believe it or not I like gardening I like we bought a historic plantation named the the Bel Air plantation back in 2012 Ive got a tractor I like working on the property and removing brush and you know taking care of the property I love outdoors work now Okay See theres something else that I missed  favorite band or  What my favorite look I mean Im a child of the 80s right So I love the cars You know I love upbeat 80s music So all the cars Thats by far my  but I also love you know Boston and Aerosmith and all the good classic rock bands as well  Thank you very much for it   Yeah thanks a lotFormer president George W Bush on Thursday delivered  in which he warned of threats to American democracy and a decay of civic engagement a message that was interpreted as a rebuke of President Trumps divisive leadership styleAt a New York forum sponsored by his presidential center Bush offered a blunt assessment of a political system corrupted by conspiracy theories and outright fabrication in which nationalism has been distorted into nativismWeve seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty Bush said during a 16-minute address at The Spirit of Liberty event Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone and provides permission for cruelty and bigotry The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to themBush did not mention Trump by name and former aides emphasized that his message echoed words he has spoken before But the fact that a former president was sounding the alarm about American values and the United States role in the world at a time when Trump has unsettled allies abroad and provoked intense political backlash at home injected his remarks with greater urgencyThe scene was remarkable in part because Bush has largely remained out of the political spotlight since leaving office amid low popularity in 2009 and had made a point not to criticize or second-guess his Democratic successor Barack Obama Just hours after Bush completed his speech Obama also made a veiled critique of the Trump era calling on Democrats at a New Jersey campaign event to send a message to the world that we are rejecting a politics of division we are rejecting a politics of fearThat Trumps two most recent predecessors felt liberated or perhaps compelled to reenter the political arena in a manner that offered an implicit criticism of him is virtually unprecedented in modern politics historians said Trump has been harshly critical of both Bush and Obama  calling each of them the worst president at one time or another  and mercilessly mocked the 43rd presidents brother Jeb Bush during the 2016 Republican primaryGeorge W Bush was taking aim at Trumps roiling of the traditional institutions of the country and in particular demeaning the office of the president by a kind of crude or vulgar bashing of opponents said Robert Dallek a presidential historian and authorI think this is Bush throwing down the gauntlet and feeling that this is a man who has gone too far Dallek said The discretion former presidents traditionally afforded their successors is now sort of fading to the past because of the belligerence of TrumpIts not just the former presidents Two days ago Sen John McCain (R-Ariz) while receiving the National Constitution Centers Liberty Medal lambasted half-baked spurious nationalism and suggested the United States was abandoning its leadership role an approach the Vietnam War veteran and former prisoner of war called unpatrioticMcCains critique prompted Trump to warn him to  because he is prepared to fight backThe common thread among Bushs and McCains words was a defense of the post-World War II liberal order that America helped build which supported strong security alliances a defense of human rights and an open economic system of free trade said Richard Fontaine who served on the National Security Council under Bush and was a foreign policy adviser to McCainWhile Republicans and Democrats have disagreed over the means to achieve such objectives Trump has opened a direct assault on many of these ideals Fontaine saidThe hallmark of McCains and Bushs speeches was to try to re-center us on what have been since 1945 these traditional ends said Fontaine now the president of the Center for a New American SecurityBefore leaving office Obama had said his goal was to remain out of the political spotlight in part to afford his successor the political space to govern as Bush had done for him He cautioned at the time however that he would speak out if he saw  at riskSince Trump took office Obama has spoken out on occasion to defend his legacy against Trumps attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act unwind US participation in the Paris climate accord and impose new limits on immigrationOn Thursday Obama returned to the campaign trail stumping for Democratic gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and Virginia Though he was not as dire as Bush Obama said in New Jersey that some of the politics we see now we thought we put that to bed Thats folks looking 50 years back Its the 21st century not the 19th centuryHe also reminded his audience that you cant take this election or any election for granted Pausing a beat he added I dont know if you all noticed thatJennifer Psaki who worked as White House communications director under Obama said the unifying themes between Obama and Bush are humanity and empathy towards the American publicThe two leaders are not weighing in on the political news of the day she noted but are instead speaking to the conduct the empathy the leadership qualities that the American public needs of someone in the Oval OfficeBush opened his remarks by speaking in both English and Spanish and noting that refugees from Afghanistan China North Korea and Venezuela were seated in the audience This week two federal judges temporarily  on immigrants and refugees from several countriesBush who had unsuccessfully attempted to advance legislation that featured a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants later praised the forgotten dynamism that immigration has always brought to AmericaBush also warned that bigotry seems emboldened in a passage that evoked the aftermath of the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in August which left a female counterprotester dead Trump had  from Democrats and some Republicans for failing to clearly and promptly denounce the hate groups and suggesting equivalence between protesters on both sidesBigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed Bush said in a line that drew the most applause He paused and appeared to grinOn Twitter as liberal and moderate pundits praised Bushs remarks some far-right commentators mocked them by noting that many had lambasted Bushs record of lengthy wars in Iraq and Afghanistan Bushs aides had at times called on the public to rally around the president in the wake of the Sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks and suggested criticism of Bush was unpatrioticEliot Cohen who served as a State Department counselor in the Bush administration said those who consistently attack Bushs record as a way to delegitimize anything he says could wind up helping Trump continue to sow division by inadvertently validating his tacticsPolitics are now about discrediting people by ad hominem attacks not by argumentation Cohen said Those who opposed Bushs wars have a fair point of view he said but their constant demonization does help make it easier for TrumpThank you all Thank you Ok Padilla gracias So I painted Ramon I wish you were still standing here Its a face only a mother could love  no its a fabulous face I love you Ramon thank you very much for being hereAnd Grace Jo thank you for your testimony And big Tim I got to know Tim as a result of Presidential Leadership Scholars at the Bush Center along with the Clinton Foundation with help from 41 and LBJs librariesI am thrilled that friends of ours from Afghanistan China North Korea and Venezuela are here as well These are people who have experienced the absence of freedom and they know what its like and they know there is a better alternative to tyrannyLaura and I are thrilled that the Bush Center supporters are here Bernie [Tom Bernstein] I want to thank you and your committee I call him BernieIts amazing to have Secretary Albright share the stage with Condi and Ambassador Haley For those of you that kind of take things for granted thats a big deal Thank youWe are gathered in the cause of liberty This is a unique moment The great democracies face new and serious threats  yet seem to be losing confidence in their own calling and competence Economic political and national security challenges proliferate and they are made worse by the tendency to turn inward The health of the democratic spirit itself is at issue And the renewal of that spirit is the urgent task at handSince World War II America has encouraged and benefited from the global advance of free markets from the strength of democratic alliances and from the advance of free societies At one level this has been a raw calculation of interest The 20century featured some of the worst horrors of history because dictators committed them Free nations are less likely to threaten and fight each otherAnd free trade helped make America into a global economic powerFor more than 70 years the presidents of both parties believed that American security and prosperity were directly tied to the success of freedom in the world And they knew that the success depended in large part on US leadership This mission came naturally because it expressed the DNA of American idealismWe know deep down that repression is not the wave of the future We know that the desire for freedom is not confined to or owned by any culture it is the inborn hope of our humanity We know that free governments are the only way to ensure that the strong are just and the weak are valued And we know that when we lose sight of our ideals it is not democracy that has failed It is the failure of those charged with preserving and protecting democracyThis is not to underestimate the historical obstacles to the development of democratic institutions and a democratic culture Such problems nearly destroyed our country  and that should encourage a spirit of humility and a patience with others Freedom is not merely a political menu option or a foreign policy fad it should be the defining commitment of our country and the hope of the worldThat appeal is proved not just by the content of peoples hopes but a noteworthy hypocrisy No democracy pretends to be a tyranny Most tyrannies pretend they are democracies Democracy remains the definition of political legitimacy That has not changed and that will not changeYet for years challenges have been gathering to the principles we hold dear And we must take them seriously Some of these problems are external and obvious Here in New York City you know the threat of terrorism all too well It is being fought even now on distant frontiers and in the hidden world of intelligence and surveillance There is the frightening evolving threat of nuclear proliferation and outlaw regimes And there is an aggressive challenge by Russia and China to the norms and rules of the global order  proposed revisions that always seem to involve less respect for the rights of free nations and less freedom for the individualThese matters would be difficult under any circumstances They are further complicated by a trend in western countries away from global engagement and democratic confidence Parts of Europe have developed an identity crisis We have seen insolvency economic stagnation youth unemployment anger about immigration resurgent ethno-nationalism and deep questions about the meaning and durability of the European UnionAmerica is not immune from these trends In recent decades public confidence in our institutions has declined Our governing class has often been paralyzed in the face of obvious and pressing needs The American dream of upward mobility seems out of reach for some who feel left behind in a changing economy Discontent deepened and sharpened partisan conflicts Bigotry seems emboldened Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabricationThere are some signs that the intensity of support for democracy itself has waned especially among the young who never experienced the galvanizing moral clarity of the Cold War or never focused on the ruin of entire nations by socialist central planning Some have called this democratic deconsolidation Really it seems to be a combination of weariness frayed tempers and forgetfulnessWe have seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty At times it can seem like the forces pulling us apart are stronger than the forces binding us together Argument turns too easily into animosity Disagreement escalates into dehumanization Too often we judge other groups by their worst examples while judging ourselves by our best intentions  forgetting the image of God we should see in each otherWeve seen nationalism distorted into nativism  forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade  forgetting that conflict instability and poverty follow in the wake of protectionismWe have seen the return of isolationist sentiments  forgetting that American security is directly threatened by the chaos and despair of distant places where threats such as terrorism infectious disease criminal gangs and drug trafficking tend to emergeIn all these ways we need to recall and recover our own identity Americans have a great advantage To renew our country we only need to remember our valuesThis is part of the reason we meet here today How do we begin to encourage a new 21century American consensus on behalf of democratic freedom and free markets Thats the question I posed to scholars at the Bush Institute That is what Pete Wehner and Tom Melia who are with us today have answered with The Spirit of Liberty At Home In The World a Call to Action paperThe recommendations come in broad categories Here they are First America must harden its own defenses Our country must show resolve and resilience in the face of external attacks on our democracy And that begins with confronting a new era of cyber threatsAmerica is experiencing the sustained attempt by a hostile power to feed and exploit our countrys divisions According to our intelligence services the Russian government has made a project of turning Americans against each other This effort is broad systematic and stealthy its conducted across a range of social media platforms Ultimately this assault wont succeed But foreign aggressions  including cyberattacks disinformation and financial influence  should not be downplayed or tolerated This is a clear case where the strength of our democracy begins at home We must secure our electoral infrastructure and protect our electoral system from subversionThe second category of recommendations concerns the projection of American leadership  maintaining Americas role in sustaining and defending an international order rooted in freedom and free marketsOur security and prosperity are only found in wise sustained global engagement In the cultivation of new markets for American goods In the confrontation of security challenges before they fully materialize and arrive on our shores In the fostering of global health and development as alternatives to suffering and resentment In the attraction of talent energy and enterprise from all over the world In serving as a shining hope for refugees and a voice for dissidents human rights defenders and the oppressedWe should not be blind to the economic and social dislocations caused by globalization People are hurting They are angry And they are frustrated We must hear them and help them But we cant wish globalization away any more than we could wish away the agricultural revolution or the industrial revolution One strength of free societies is their ability to adapt to economic and social disruptionsAnd that should be our goal to prepare American workers for new opportunities to care in practical empowering ways for those who may feel left behind The first step should be to enact policies that encourage robust economic growth by unlocking the potential of the private sector and for unleashing the creativity and compassion of this countryA third focus of this document is strengthening democratic citizenship And here we must put particular emphasis on the values and views of the youngOur identity as a nation  unlike many other nations  is not determined by geography or ethnicity by soil or blood Being an American involves the embrace of high ideals and civic responsibility We become the heirs of Thomas Jefferson by accepting the ideal of human dignity found in the Declaration of Independence We become the heirs of James Madison by understanding the genius and values of the US Constitution We become the heirs of Martin Luther King Jr by recognizing one another not by the color of their skin but by the content of their characterThis means that people of every race religion and ethnicity can be fully and equally American It means that bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creedAnd it means that the very identity of our nation depends on the passing of civic ideals to the next generationWe need a renewed emphasis on civic learning in schools And our young people need positive role models Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone provides permission for cruelty and bigotry and compromises the moral education of children The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to themFinally the Call to Action calls on the major institutions of our democracy public and private to consciously and urgently attend to the problem of declining trustFor example our democracy needs a media that is transparent accurate and fair Our democracy needs religious institutions that demonstrate integrity and champion civil discourse Our democracy needs institutions of higher learning that are examples of truth and free expressionIn short it is time for American institutions to step up and provide cultural and moral leadership for this nationTen years ago I attended a Conference on Democracy and Security in Prague The goal was to put human rights and human freedom at the center of our relationships with repressive governments The Prague Charter signed by champions of liberty Vaclav Havel Natan Sharansky Jose Maria Aznar called for the isolation and ostracism of regimes that suppress peaceful opponents by threats or violenceLittle did we know that a decade later a crisis of confidence would be developing within the core democracies making the message of freedom more inhibited and wavering Little did we know that repressive governments would be undertaking a major effort to encourage division in western societies and to undermine the legitimacy of electionsRepressive rivals along with skeptics here at home misunderstand something important It is the great advantage of free societies that we creatively adapt to challenges without the direction of some central authority Self-correction is the secret strength of freedom We are a nation with a history of resilience and a genius for renewalRight now one of our worst national problems is a deficit of confidence But the cause of freedom justifies all our faith and effort It still inspires men and women in the darkest corners of the world and it will inspire a rising generation The American spirit does not say We shall manage or We shall make the best of it It says We shall overcome And that is exactly what we will do with the help of God and one anotherThank youFor the past nine years George W Bush has largely stayed out of presidential politics he declined to criticize his successor Barack Obama and he chose not to endorse but largely ignored President Trump While Mitt Romney and others spoke out publicly against Trump Bush stayed above the frayThat changed in a big way ThursdaySpeaking at a George W Bush Institute event in New York Bush didnt use Trumps name but his target became clearer as the speech progressed Heres a samplingAny one of these quotes in isolation could be dismissed as highflying rhetoric aimed at the general coarsening of our political culture  or the rise of forms of nationalism and extremism that clearly exist outside the Oval OfficeBut almost each of these quoteshas some connection to Trump Conspiracy theories and fabrications Check and check Nationalism and nativism Check A degraded discourse Big check Bigotry and white supremacy Trumpwas criticized for not calling them out strongly enough in Charlottesville BullyingHuge check Not living up to civic values Check definitelySen John McCain (R-Ariz) drew plenty of attention for alludingto  in a speech this week But Bushs comments actually hark back to a  that McCain delivered in February Heres what McCain said at the MunichSecurity Conference in GermanySound familiarIts possible Bush would argue that Trump is more a symptom of all of these unhealthy trends in American democracy than the root of them But in drafting a prepared speech like that he had to know how those words would be perceivedTrump during the 2016 campaign repeatedly attacked Bush most notably  and  More recently he has favorably which many view as the worst moment of Bushs tenureOn Thursday Bush clearly decided that silence was no longer tenableDonald Trumps campaign has begun formally vetting possible running mates with former House speaker Newt Gingrich emerging as the leading candidate followed by New Jersey Gov Chris Christie But there are more than a half dozen others being discussed as possibilities according to several people with knowledge of the processGiven Trumps unpredictability campaign associates caution that the presumptive Republican nominee could still shake up his shortlist But with little more than two weeks before the start of the Republican National Convention Gingrich and Christie have been asked to submit documents and are being cast as favorites for the post inside the campaign Gingrich in particular is the beneficiary of a drumbeat of support from Trump confidants such as Ben CarsonA number of senators  including Jeff Sessions (Ala) and Bob Corker (Tenn)  are also being reviewed as viable picks although the extent to which they are being vetted is unclear A longer shot on Trumps radar is Indiana Gov Mike Pence a heavyweight on the right who could bolster Trumps tepid support among some conservative activistsBut Pence is immersed in his reelection race and Trump is said to want a more electric politician at his side rather than a low-profile figure Most of his primary rivals are reluctant to sign on and tensions with Ohio Gov John Kasich and Sen Ted Cruz (Tex) remain rawDetails of the running-mate search were provided by five people with knowledge of the process who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations with campaign officials  Gingrich who said on Fox News Sunday over the weekend that nobody has called me from the Trump campaign about the possibility of being vice president declined to comment Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks also declined to comment Christies office did not respond to an inquiryThe contenders under the most serious consideration such as Gingrich and Christie have been asked by attorney Arthur B Culvahouse Jr to answer more than 100 questions and to provide reams of personal and professional files that include tax records and any articles or books they have publishedCulvahouse a former White House counsel who is managing the vetting for Trump was the lawyer who vetted then-Alaska Gov Sarah Palin for the GOP vice-presidential nomination during the 2008 campaignThe narrowing list of running-mate possibilities comes at the end of a turbulent period for Trump who has struggled to raise money since clinching the GOP nomination and has stumbled through a series of self-inflicted controversies including a racially charged attack on a sitting federal judge and a continuing outcry over his rhetoric against Muslims and other minoritiesThe presumptive Republican nominee continues to indicate that he will probably choose someone who could balance his brash populist persona with a political profile that includes deep experience in Washington or ties to the party establishment the people familiar with the search saidThe timing of Trumps announcement was for months expected to happen close to the convention But campaign aides are now discussing moving it up perhaps to later next week so the ticket can generate headlines and coverage  and win over party leaders  ahead of the party gathering in ClevelandWith Gingrich 73 or Christie 53 the 70-year-old mogul would be joined by a well-connected Republican who shares his combative style and his ease at being a ubiquitous media presence Both men have won Trumps favor by actively supporting him  Gingrich primarily through television appearances and Christie through behind-the-scenes talks with party leaders and leading GOP donors  Their experience facing down and cutting deals with Democrats has also drawn the interest of Trump who has acknowledged that he would be a novice at working directly with lawmakersGingrich would bring with him a history of battling with presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton going back to their public fights over health care and Bill Clintons agenda and ultimate impeachment in the 1990s during her husbands presidency For years Gingrich was seen by Clinton allies not just as an opponent but a nemesis with a penchant for grandiose rhetoric and barbed attacks  traits that Trump is said to welcomeTrump himself has heavily turned to elements of the 1990s in recent weeks on the campaign revisiting past Clinton-related scandals and issues as he builds his case against the former secretary of stateSessions and Corker are among the other names mentioned by people who have spoken with Trump officials Sessions a conservative populist who was the first senator to endorse Trump last year has seen many of his trusted aides take on high-ranking roles in the Trump campaign Corker the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has voiced support for some of Trumps views Sens Richard Burr (NC) Tom Cotton (Ark) and John Thune (SD) have also been bandied about in Trump Tower as options Sen Joni Ernst (Iowa) and Oklahoma Gov Mary Fallin who previously served in the House are two of the leading women in the mixBut shortcomings for many of these candidates have made their chances seem less likely to Trump advisersPence Thune and Burr would bring heft and have held leadership positions but they are focused on their reelection bids Corker is well liked by campaign chairman Paul Manafort but his recent public criticisms of Trumps tone and statements have not been welcomed by the candidateCruz is seen as someone Trump would like to bring into the fold because of his political capital with the conservative movement But their bitter clashes during the primary have left a mark and Cruz has so far declined to endorse Trump That has not stopped members of Trumps team from reaching out to members of Cruzs circle and trying for a reconciliationTrumps desire for a governing partner is not the only factor that has been mentioned in discussions among aides Contenders rapport with the mogul and their ability to comfortably communicate and defend his nontraditional platform are also crucial the people familiar with the process said  Less central have been the candidates home states or regional influence given that Trump sees the campaign as a nationalized political war that is largely being fought on televisionTrumps inclination toward naming a seasoned player has been encouraged by Manafort the longtime GOP insider who has taken full control of the process following Trumps firing of Corey Lewandowski who had been campaign managerYet even as Manafort steers the selection and as members of Trumps orbit  especially his children and son-in-law Jared Kushner  informally weigh in there is a collective understanding within the campaign that Trumps voice is the only voice that matters One person involved in the process suggested the ultimate decision will come down to a committee of one Trump This is in his head the person said Its up to himRobert Jeffress a Dallas pastor who has become close with Trump during the campaign said in an interview that while he has not spoken to Trump about the vice-presidential slot Trump has made clear that he wants someone who can help get his legislative agenda through CongressI think that is how he is going Jeffress said Hed be coming in as an outsider and that has fueled his popularity But he is the first to admit that he doesnt know all the ways of Washington So to actually push what he wants through hes willing to reach out and get somebody to lend a handLarry Mitchell has a retortfor every white supremacist

blackanythingAfter a [Floyd] Mayweather fight or after Serena [Williams] wins a tennis match you go online and people say go back to Africa  he told The Washington Post And instead of sitting online arguing with them I just thought of a sly way to come back at them  Mitchell said he has been hearing Go back to Africa mywhole lifeAn incident on the campaign trail highlighted how the phrase is now wielded In March Black Lives Matter demonstrators and other groups disrupted a Donald Trump rally in Chicago which was ultimately canceled because of security concerns Outside the venue a bearded white man in a blue cap and a camouflage jacket while he cursed at black protestersYou consider yourself an African American go back to Africa he is heard screaming in a video that was widely circulated on social media If youre an African first then go back to AfricaWhether blacks should go back to Africa hasbeen an undercurrent of American racial politicsfor almost as long as there have been black people in the United States Supporters of the idea have argued for more than a century that returning to Africa is thebest way toescape economic and social oppression Others question whether blacks in America can go back to a continent they have never seen and to which they dont have acultural connection in a 1917 article traces the origins of the back-to-Africa movement as far back as 1714 The article quotes a letter from Thomas Jefferson who said that sending free blacks to Africa was the most desirable measure which could be adopted for gradually drawing off the black populationIn the 20th century back-to-Africa proponents including Marcus Garvey an early advocate of pan-Africanism felt that the best way for blacks to escape economic and social oppression in the United Stateswas to return to the lands of their forefathers Garvey even started a shipping line that he hoped would ferry American blacks across the AtlanticMitchell said he learned some of that history as a child His mother and uncles always encouraged him to read and they made sure some of his books were about black historyOn Martin Luther King Day we would have to read a book and then do a report Mitchell told The Washington Post We would study history but my uncles wanted to make sure I knew about  historyRecently hesaid he hasbeen reading more about the back-to-Africa movementThousands of African Americans saw returning to Africa as a worthwhile plan according toFodei Battyan assistant professor of political science at Quinnipiac University who Over the past 150 years tens of thousands of African Americans have resettled in Africa The United States has seen numerous back-to-Africa movements from the 1800s to contemporary times For instance Paul Cuffe a prosperous former slave and businessman in post-colonial Massachusetts spearheaded one of the first back-to-Africa movements and helped return settlers to Sierra Leone in 1815Beginning in 1822 the white-led American Colonization Society (ACS) resettled thousands of freeborn blacks and freed slaves in a region in West Africa next to Sierra Leone that became LiberiaIts unclear when the phrase shifted from a cultural what-if to an insult According toAtlantablackstarcom a news magazine that focuses on African and African American issues the insult is steeped in the assumption among whites  that Black folks should be happy to be in America which through its kindness and generosity has rendered African-Americans the most fortunate Black people around There is a perverse outlandish assertion that Black people should leave if they cannot appreciate all that white people have done for themThere have been incidents when a fewangry people have shouted Go back to Africa  whohavegiven them tickets or to people And peoplesay it pretty frequently toMitchell  and to some of the black people whohaveread and shared his GoFundMe postIm not funding you out of hate I love this and think

comments to the media since  And it wasnt long before the defensive end ready to go after a  for his role in a domestic-abuse case provideda cringe-inducing metaphorWhen asked how long he expects it to take before he returns to his Pro Bowl form Hardy had this to say (via DallasCowboyscom)I hope not long I hope I come out guns blazin Im full of excitement and full of juiceThis from a man who was alleged by his former girlfriend Nicole Holder to have pickedher up over his head and slammed her onto a futon that was covered in semi-automatic rifles  weaponsthat he menacingly told her were loadedIn a case that dates back to his time with the Panthers Holder claimedthat Hardy threw her around his apartment including onto a tiled bathroom floor leaving marks all over her body including where he had grabbed her neckHardys lawyer contended that his client was the one attacked and that the defensive end had been acting in self-defense but a North Carolina judge convicted him of assaulting and threatening to kill Holder However Hardy appealed that decision to a jury trial one in which his case was dismissed after Holder failed to appear amid reports that the two sides had reached a private settlementHardy who sat out most of last season on the NFLs exempt list as his case played out was given a 10-game suspension about a month after he signed with the Cowboys That suspension was eventually reduced to four games leading to Hardys appearance in the Cowboys locker room TuesdayIm ready to go Hardy told reporters I have what they call fresh legs Im really excited to get out there on that grass or turf and see what they can doHardy was asked if has had any regrets about theevents that led to his suspensionIm sorry I couldnt be here for my teammates he replied The

arrested Sunday night for felony possession of a controlled substance according to multiple The arrest occurred after the former Cowboys defensive end was pulled over at a traffic stop in the Dallas suburb of Richardson TexAccording to police Hardy was in possession of a penalty group 1 drug which state laws indicate could be cocaine heroin methamphetamine GHB ketamine oxycodone or hydrocodone

confrontations with Dallas teammates including  arrived  and reportedly caused concern by the team that he  during the season He was not re-signed by the Cowboys when the season ended and at this point its hard to imagine another team taking a chance on Hardy anytime soonOn Sunday Greg Hardy raised a ruckus with his presence on the Dallas Cowboys sideline Last week though it was his absence that caused concernHardy was late for practice Thursday and didnt check in with the Cowboys It took the team most of the morning to find him and it eventually listedillness as the reason he did not practiceOn Sunday Hardy took it upon himself to enter the Cowboys special-teams huddle after it had given up a 100-yard touchdown return of a kickoff late in the teams loss to the New York Giants He slapped the clipboard of coach Rich Bisaccia and when Dez Bryant attempted to intervene Hardy started yelling at him in a bizarre sceneAfterward owner Jerry Jones said he had no problem with Hardy that he was just being a leader And on Monday Coach Jason Garrett said that Hardy would not be disciplined for the ugliness By Monday afternoon with criticism being heaped upon Hardy Jones and the team Garrett had changed his tone a bit (Only a bit) That was just a situation that oftentimes happens on a sideline where guys are trying to encourage and inspire other guys on their team  on Monday He was fired up and wanted to make sure that the special-teams unit was going to get the job done Sometimes those things happen It wasnt exactly the right time and place as were getting ready to go out on the field We got that conveyed and communicated and we all moved onMaybe they have but their tone-deaf treatment of the situation is cause for concern Stephen Jones the owners son and teams executive vice-president said the Cowboys would consider a long-term deal with the defensive end who is signed only for this season and would become a free agent He is sure to draw interest but he brings a growing amount of baggage with himHardy has played in only two games since serving a four-game suspension related to a 2014 domestic violence incident that sidelined him on the exempt/commissioners permission list for the last 15 games of the season In his first comments after his suspension ended he managed to strike the wrong tone promising to come out with guns blazing and making an off-kilter remark about Gisele Bundchen Tom Bradys wife and the attractiveness of quarterback spouses in general And in May he was for attempting to tweet a joke about the Twin TowersOn Sunday at least he was keeping his mouth shut telling reporters no comment at least a half-dozen times knowing that Jerry Jones and the Cowboys would continue to cover for him until this reaches a point when they cant anymoreWe dont know how much Hillary Clinton was paid as an advance on  her recently released book about her time at the State Department Which makes it hard for us to judge how good a business decision the book was for its publisher Simon & SchusterSales of the book  in its second week on the market But the publisher is upbeat Most importantly the publishers spokesman told  about the roll-out reader reaction has been terrific This is the book publishing equivalent of telling your kid that the important thing about his lopsided loss in soccer was that everyone had fun Or winning an attendance award in schoolThe closest thing we have to an official estimate of Clintons advance comes from industry rumors reported  by the  and more obliquely by outlets like  The figure thats floating out there $14 million That number hasnt been confirmed by Clinton or the publisher but it doesnt seem completely out of line with reality Clinton got $8 million for her previous book  Her husband got somewhere north of $10 million for his memoirThe problem for Simon & Schuster is that the book isnt performing as well as  or other comparable works (Obligatory caveat It  selling better than other political nonfiction works that have come out recently -- if ) The table below illustrates the challenge using the  for the books hardcover and electronic versionsThere are a lot of assumptions built in there such as the estimated sales of the electronic versions Simon & Schuster reported only that total sales including electronic formats were over 100000 in the first week But the total earned assuming all of those books were purchased at full price is just over $5 million And the advance isnt the only cost the publisher is trying to recoup of course There are printing costs and staff costs and promotional costs and so onMore books will sell But probably not enough First week sales typically account for about 30 percent of the total the  writes That would put the total book sales at somewhere around 350000 Even if all of those books sold for the full hardcover price of $35 thats only $12250000 in total income Which we remind you is less than $14 millionThe news isnt all bad for the publisher It is making an investment in Clinton that could pay off if say she runs for president and wins Its likely that Simon & Schuster would be her first choice for publishing any post-White-House memoirs tooAnd again its not like its not selling at all As  it is easily outselling such popular nonfiction works as Thomas Pikettys Capital In the Twenty-First Century If youre outselling a dense look at global economics youve got to be doing something right -- even if your concept of 21st century capital doesnt include an insistence on making a profitMovie mogul Harvey Weinstein has been terminated from his position at the Weinstein Co according to a statementfrom the board of directors on SundayThe move to oust Weinstein came just days after the high-powered Hollywood film producer was thrust into the spotlight after the New York Times published a  Thursday that revealed decades of sexual harassment claims by actresses and female employees against himIn response to the Times story Weinstein announced in a statement Thursday that he would be taking a leave of absence from his company Then on Saturday  who had been serving as an adviser to Weinstein  and who had told the Times that Weinstein denies many of the accusations as patently false  tweeted that she would be stepping down from that position My understanding is that Mr Weinstein and his board are moving toward an agreement she saidIn its decision Sunday the Weinstein Cos board of directors said that new information about the executives conduct informed their decision  Weinstein who founded Miramax Films with his brother Bob in 1979 before leaving in 2005 to create the Weinstein Company was known in the film industry for both his volatile temper and business acumen which helped turn his studio into an Oscar force to be reckoned withAs The Washington Posts  For an 11-year period from 1992 to 2003 Miramax Filmshad at least one [of] its films nominated for an Oscar each year winning best picture for several of them including The English Patient (1996) Shakespeare in Love (1998) and Chicago (2002)  According to the Times investigation accusations of sexual misconduct against Weinstein extended over decades At least eight of those claims resulted in settlements between the accuser and Weinstein Actress Ashley Judd the most high-profile of the women to speak on record alleged that under the pretense of a business meeting the producer and studio head asked her if she would watch him shower or if he could give her a massageI appreciate the way Ive behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain and I sincerely apologize for it Weinstein told the Times He said he came of age in the 60s and 70s when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different That was the culture thenSeveral stars spoke out after the Times article was published theyincluded Rose McGowan an actress with whom Weinstein reached a $100000 settlement in 1997 Women fight on And to the men out there stand up We need you as allies #bebrave she tweeted shortly after thearticlespublicationOther actors including Lena Dunham Mark Ruffalo and Seth Rogen posted messages of support for those who had filed claims against the producerI believe all the women coming forward about Harvey Weinsteins sexual harassment It takes bravery to do so Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) To be clear what Harvey Weinstein did was a disgusting abuse of power and horrible I hope we are now seeing the beginning of the end of these abuses Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) But silence in some circles seemed to speak volumes about the range of his influence  Weinsteins alleged misdeeds  have long been whispered about within the film world where Weinstein is as famous for hyping films like Shakespeare in Love and The Kings Speech to Oscar wins as he is for re-cutting the films he produces Late-night comedy hosts did not address the allegations in their respective monologues Thursday or Friday and Saturday Night Live known for skewering politics and Hollywood alike did not mention Weinstein once in this weekends episode  a slight that   Times Hollywood reporter Brooks Barnes  that more than 40 entertainment industry people he contacted about the allegations refused to speak on the record A publicist for an A-list actress said there was no upside for her client to comment especially since she did not have a movie to promote he saidThe scope of Weinsteins power was felt far beyond the film sphereHe was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton (and employer of Malia Obama she interned for his company) prompting criticsto  who had received financial contributions from the vocal liberal to donate those fundsto charity (Democratic New York Sens Charles ESchumer and Kirsten Gillibrand joined  Sunday of senators who said they would donate the money Weinstein had given them to various charity groups )What the future holds for the famed producer remains unclear While his career at the Weinstein Co is over the discussion of sexual politics in Hollywood seems to be just beginningAs he ran for governor in Virginia Corey A Stewart faced ridicule from fellow Republicans as he cast himself as an unapologetic clone of Donald Trump who even as he captured the White House lost the commonwealth to Hillary Clinton Yet Stewart insisted that he understood Virginias electorate and refused to abandon his divisive rhetoric and raw-toned defense of Confederate monuments that drew support from white nationalist groups On Tuesday Stewart proved himself something of a political sage astounding Virginia Republicans by coming within a shade over one percentage point of upsetting Ed Gillespie the front-runner throughout the campaign who was far better-known and raised more than $4 million more than his opponent Standing before a cheering crowd of supporters Stewart refused to concede saying he would not support Gillespie as the partys nominee and promised to continue the revolution that Donald Trump started There is one word you will never hear from me and thats unity Stewart said Weve been backing down too long Weve been backing down too long in defense of our culture and our heritage and our countryIn an era of seismic political surprises Stewarts primary showing in miniature was as whiplash-inducing as Trumps victory in November and Virginia Republican Rep Dave Brats upset over then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in 2014 Negative campaigning always does well and Coreys strategy though not honorable was a path to victory said Shaun Kenney the former head of Virginias Republican Party You drive down turnout to the fanatical base and lean on that base to turn out And thats what Corey accomplishedChris LaCivita a Republican strategist who has advised numerous statewide candidates in Virginia said he was dumbfounded that Stewart came so close But he rejected any suggestion that Stewarts performance was a validation of Trump-style politics if only because the business executive fired Stewart when he served as his Virginia state chairman during the presidential campaignInstead LaCivita said Stewarts showing was an affirmation of an old political saying which is to never let your opponent define youCorey Stewart ran an extremely nasty campaign that was never responded to LaCivita said The fact of the matter is that Ed never laid a glove on him Corey was a very vulnerable opponent with minimal resources For more than a year Stewart portrayed himself as a Trump acolyte echoing the Republicans attacks on political correctness and undocumented immigrants During campaign appearances Stewart relished the chance to remind audiences of his own crackdown on immigrants as the chairman of Prince William Board of County Supervisors More recently he tethered himself to the Confederate flag repeatedly traveling to Charlottesville to protest local officials who wanted to remove a statue of Robert E Lee from downtownAs polls showed Stewart trailing Gillespie Virginia Republicans and political observers mocked his approach predicting failure not only statewide but also in Prince William where he faces reelection in 2019You had to ask if he was running for the president of the Confederacy or governor of Virginia Mark Rozell a political-science professor at George Mason University said a few days before the election Yet those same political observers were scrambling to make sense of the results as they came in after the polls closed Tuesday night The strength of Stewarts performance said Thomas M Davis (R) a former Virginia congressman signifies that the Republican Party is moving from the country club to the country Republicans used to play in high-end suburbs and now its a different equation Davis said Now its blue collar Trump understood this and that was Stewarts playbook Only last week Davis like many Virginia Republicans forecast that Stewart would be roundly defeated in the primary Davis even questioned whether Stewart would abandon politics altogether calculating that because of his divisiveness Prince William voters would reject him if he runs for reelection in 2019 As the results came in Tuesday Stewart held a 2-to-1 advantage in Prince William Nevertheless Davis said Stewart would face hurdles to retaining his seat in Prince William a county that has undergone a demographic shift and has switched from supporting Republican presidential candidates to Democratic ones It will be difficult for him to win a general election in Prince William Davis said speculating that Stewart may fare better as a statewide candidate Even before Tuesdays vote Republican circles were rife with chatter about potential challengers to Stewart if he decides to run in Prince William in 2019 During the primary campaign a preponderance of the countys political establishment abandoned him in favor of Gillespie including the countys sheriff who recanted his endorsement of Stewart saying he had become disgusted with his rhetoric There are a lot of people smelling blood in the water right now said Willie Deutsch a Republican member of the Prince William County School Board He will have a very difficult time getting renominated or reelectedPete Candland a Republican supervisor in Prince William who endorsed Gillespie said Stewart focused on divisive issues at a time when people are weary of political conflictHe has made some big miscalculations said Candland among those considering a future race for Stewarts seat As Ive talked to voters they want to hear about the issues that are concerning to them and they are the issues that Corey usually talks very well on  improving roads cutting taxes Any other topic they see as distractionsPatrick Sowers the president of a homeowners association in Prince William volunteered for Stewarts 2015 reelection campaign in the county and was eager to support him in the gubernatorial race But Sowers said he became uncomfortable because of Stewarts divisiveness and alliances with extremists Corey picked a fight that shouldnt have been picked and instead of backing away from it he doubled down Sowers said To support Stewart in the future he said before Tuesdays vote he would need him to  I dont want to say recant  but I want to hear him publicly rethink some of the policies he has supportedTOKYO  North Korea put on a jaw-dropping military display Saturday when the regime celebrated its most important day of the year  the anniversary of its founder Kim Il SungKim Jong Un the founders grandson and the current leader of North Korea has made it very clear that he wants nuclear warheads and the means to deliver them to the United States In his New Years Day address Kim said that North Korea was entering the final stage of preparations to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the American mainlandSo experts were anticipating a big show Saturday but even they were stunned by the range of apparently new missiles on display and the sheer number of themWe talked to Jeffrey Lewis head of the East Asia program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California and a self-described about the missiles on display SaturdayHere are the highlights (or lowlights depending on your perspective)Lets start at the end As the finale for Saturdays parade the North Korean military wheeled two sets of huge missile canisters through Kim Il Sung Square These are the canisters that hold the missiles not the missiles themselves and its anyones guess what was inside the canisters Maybe maybe nothing at allBut if its not an ICBM itself its bridge to an ICBM Lewis saidOne set of canisters appeared to be the right size for the KN-08 a three-stage missile that North Korea calls the Hwasong-13 With a theoretical range of about 7500 miles this missile could reach all of the United States from North Korea This thing (left) looks like a Chinese DF-31 (right) The canister is ICBM-sized though whats inside is anyones guess  Jeffrey Lewis (@ArmsControlWonk) The natural reaction is What the hell is that Lewis said of the canister Maybe there is a KN-08 inside it maybe theres some new missile inside it or maybe its nothing Its a mysteryThe second set of giant canisters looked similar to those for the Topol-M the Russian intercontinental ballistic missile he said Whats inside those is a mystery too And this thing (left) looks like a Russian Topol (right) Again no idea whats inside the canister if anything  Jeffrey Lewis (@ArmsControlWonk) My guess is that what its intended to convey is that there are more ICBMs coming more solid-fuel missiles Lewis saidThe North Korean military displayed six ballistic missiles that can be launched from a submarine which the United States calls the KN-11 but which North Korea calls the Pukguksong-1 (or Polaris-1)More SLBMs   Dave Schmerler (@DaveSchmerler) North Korea  from a submarine near its east coast port of Sinpo in August and it flew about 300 miles before falling into the sea inside Japans air-defense identification zone the area in which Tokyo controls aircraft movementKim described it as the greatest success at the time and said North Korea has joined the front rank of the military powers fully equipped with nuclear attack capabilityAnalysts were surprised to see six of these missiles in the paradeIt looks like a real missile Lewis said They could go to all the trouble of manufacturing a perfect copy but if youre doing that its just as easy to make the real missileNorth Korea also displayed  for the first time its KN-15 the land-based version of its submarine-launched ballistic missile which North Korea calls the Pukguksong-2 (or Polaris-2) This is also powered by solid fuelNice HighRes of the Pukguksong-2 TELs  Nathan J Hunt (@ISNJH) North Korea  for the first time earlier this month firing it from a land base near Sinpo home to a known North Korean submarine baseThe missile did not appear to go very far but still analysts described the development as scary because of the solid-fuel componentThis is what Lewiss colleague Melissa Hanham said at the time Solid fuel is very significant because they can launch these missiles much faster and with a smaller entourage than with liquid-fueled missiles making them much harder for the United States South Korea and Japan to spot from satellitesThere were black-and-white missiles that looked like KN-08s the intercontinental ballistic missile but slightly smaller Lewis said And they were rolled out on missile vehicles usually used for the medium-range Musudan missileSouth Koreas  in January citing military officials that North Korea had probably built two ICBMs that were less than 50 feet long That would make them shorter than the two known ICBMs which are between 60 and 65 feet longI think this is that said LewisLewis and his team were not sure about one type of missile that was on show painted in camouflage and transported on a tank It could be an extended-range Scud or a Rodong capable of flying up to 800 milesBut what they were sure about was that the missile had fins on it meaning that the reentry vehicle on the missile could be controlled on the way down  in other words the warhead could be maneuvered to hit a targetIf the extended range Scud was a super Scud this is a super-duper Scud said LewisA new tracked launcher for what looks like a Scud or Nodong This one will take a careful examination Control surfaces on the RV too  Jeffrey Lewis (@ArmsControlWonk) Then there were the canisters on top of tracked vehicles that North Korea displayed at the very start of the parade These appeared to be for anti-ship cruise missiles a North Korean version of Russias Kh-35 missileIn any other year North Korea having a coastal defense cruise missile and showing it to us for the first time would have made us say Wow said Lewis But this year with all this other stuff nobody cares about something that can go only 100 or 200 km he said (Thats 62 to 125 miles)This tracked transporter is new but the canisters look a lot like those associated with the Kh-35 cruise missile Compare/contrast  Jeffrey Lewis (@ArmsControlWonk) If this wasnt enough heres one more observation North Korea showed a large number of transporters during the parade many of them an indigenous tank that North Korea can build at home rather than having to import through ChinaThis means that North Korea increasingly has the ability to move its missiles around and with the road-mobile missile launchers they are now favoring over old-fashioned gantries launch them from anywhereAs Lewis puts it They want us to know that their missile program is pretty far alongHillary Clinton made a rare public appearance at the Broadway musical The Color Purple on Sunday  and received three standing ovationsPhotos from the scene

to see the playon Broadway The show which won two Tony awards ended its run with the Sunday matineeHillary Clinton said her skin crawled as Donald Trump loomed behind her at a presidential debate in St Louis and added that she wished she could have pressed pause and asked America The words Clintons most detailed public comments about what happened during one of the campaigns more memorable moments are includedin her new book What Happened which she called an attempt to pull back the curtain on her losing bid for the presidencySome of the moments during the campaign she said baffled her Others seemingly repulsed her In recounting the October incident she referred to Trump as acreepThe book comes out Sept 12 but audio excerpts read by Clintonwere played Wednesday morning In the recording Clinton noted that she wrote about moments from the campaign that she wanted to remember forever  as well as others she wished she could go back and do overThe moment from the debate appeared to fall into the latter categoryThis is not okay I thought Clinton said reading from her book It was the second presidential debate and Donald Trump was looming behind me Two days before the world heard him brag about groping women Now we were on a small stage and no matter where I walked he followed me closely staring at me making facesIt was incredibly uncomfortable He was literally breathing down my neck My skin crawled It was one of those moments where you wish you could hit pause and ask everyone watching Well what would you do Do you stay calm keep smiling and carry on as if he werent repeatedly invading your space Or do you turn look him in the eye and say loudly and clearly Back up you creep Get away from me I know you love to intimidate women but you cant intimidate me so back upWriting What Happened was hard so is what we see every day As we move forward & fight back I hope this helps  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) The debate took place two days after Trump  about groping kissing and trying to have sex with women on theAccess Hollywood tape  comments made in 2005 on an apparent hot micAfterward some Republican critics said Trump should drop out of the race But he ended a video response to the years-old tapes release by saying See you at the debate on SundayTrumps actions during the debate were viewed as bullying even before the moment that Clinton recounted Trump paced and rocked and grimaced as spoke he broke into her time by shouting over her When she protested that she had not done the same to him he shot back with all the finesse youd hear in a middle school gym Thats cause you got nothin to sayWhen it was his turn to speak Trump got angry pointed at her swung his arms around with alarming force  His actions were widely mocked and criticized after the debate and even featured in a Saturday Night Livethat showed him zooming toward an unsuspecting ClintonIf a man did that to me on the street  Id call 911 political commentator and former Republican strategist Nicolle Wallace said The New York Daily News headline the day after the debate read In the post-debate spin room Clinton surrogates accused Trump of menacingly stalking the Democratic nominee Two body language experts analyzed the debate and concluded Trump was trying to assert his power by roaming the stage while Clinton spokeTrumps constant pacing and restless movements around the stage attracted attention from Hillarys words and visually disrespected her physical presence on the stage as in I am big you are small David Givens director of the Center for Nonverbal Studies a nonprofit research center in Spokane Wash This looks like a poster for a 1970s horror movie  Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) Clinton said in the audio clip played on MSNBC that What Happened is not a comprehensive account of the 2016 race  and that it was difficult to writeEvery day that I was a candidate for president I knew that millions of people were counting on me and I couldnt bear the idea of letting them down  but I did she said I couldnt get the job done and Ill have to live with that for the rest of my life the books publisher says What Happened is Clintons most personal memoir yetIn the past for reasons I try to explain Ive often felt I had to be careful in public like I was up on a wire without a net she writes in the introductionNow Im letting my guard downImmediately after the election Clinton kept a low profile though she was  SNL even poked fun at the hubbub surrounding her sylvan whereabouts in a sketch called In recent months Clinton has slowly reemerged in the public eye making speeches and giving interviewsin which she addressed the historic electionIts unclear how much Clinton was paid for writing What HappenedSimon & Schuster representatives did not immediately respond to questions sent by email early WednesdayThe publisher  how much Clinton received for her 2014 book Hard Choices though in 2000 Clinton reportedly was paid about $8 million in advance to write a memoir (eventually titled Living History) about her years as first ladyGreg Hardy who washed out of the NFL two years agoafter a domestic-violence incident has reinvented himself as a mixed martial arts fighter and in his first fight Saturday he scored a knockout in 32 secondsWith a crowd of only  the KO by the former Carolina Panthers and Dallas Cowboys defensive end occurred in the Rise of a Warrior 21 bout against Joe Hawkins who was also making his MMA debut in Fort Pierce Fla ESPN reported that Hardy landed an overhand right then an outside leg kick and another rightIm ecstatic Ive been humbled a lot in the last two years Hardy told ESPNIm just super excited to be able to compete Im just super excited to be back in the area Im super excited to be back to the Greg Hardy everyone knows and remembers and give back to my fansHere is Greg Hardys debut He is in the blue gloves  Ted Gruber (@tedgruber) Hardy now 29 was  for the Panthers but his career nose-dived after he missed most of the 2014 season because of an alleged assault incident involving an ex-girlfriend and a bed covered with guns Initially suspended 10 games his sentence was reduced as the NFL grappled with how to punish players during its domestic violence crisis of 2014 Hardy was found guilty by a North Carolina judge and following procedure in that state asked for a jury trial The case was dismissed when the alleged victim did not appearThe Panthers let Hardywalk after that season and hesigned with the Cowboys in 2015 He never returned to his previous form though and was a near-constant distraction When he was activated after his four-game suspension he immediately grabbed headlines with an odd interview in which he speculated about the attractiveness of the wives of quarterbacks such as Tom Brady and Blake Bortles He continued to talk about guns an uncomfortable topic given the assault chargeI hope I come out guns blazin Im full of excitement and full of juice Hardy said Im ready to go I have what they call fresh legs Im really excited to get out there on that grass or turf and see what they can doWhen he missed team meetingsand the Cowboys chose not to re-sign him No other team publicly considered him and hewasin a Dallas suburb a year agoOn Saturday he said he hasnt ruled out a return to the NFL although hes focused on MMA and the UFCId be a fool to turn away from what I loved doing for so long Hardy said But its a habit of an athlete a player and a baller to put his whole heart and soul into what Im doing So the UFC has got my heart and soul Thats where Im going in my mind and my heart Everything that I do is focused on this MMA career so Im coming A post shared by GregHardyJr (@greghardyjr) onSay the name Joshua Van Alstine in Saudi Arabia and the likely response is a blank stareBut mention his Web-born persona Abu Muteb and chances are good that you will get a knowing nod or a wry smile for the baby-faced American military brat He slings Saudiaccented Arabic wears traditional Arabian robes mixes comedy and commentary and may be one of the Arab worlds most improbable celebritiesThe Internet age is awash with tales of head-scratching stardom and viral oddities Yet amid this modern mash-up Van Alstine is a niche within a niche He rode a wave of YouTube videos that were not even a blip at the college he attended near Dallas but were monster hits in Saudi Arabia and eventually caught the attention of the kingdoms rulersAn email arrived in May 2013 from the Saudi leadership asking whether he would consider moving to Riyadh Saudi Arabias capital He acceptedThis whole thing has been wild Really crazy said Van Alstine whose videos  some with more than 1 million views  also landed him on one of the Middle Easts most widely watched television channels Last week he was recruited by Qatar state television to help cover the countrys National Day celebrationsHang on a sec he apologized during a phone interview from Qatars capital DohaOkay Im back I had to take some photos with fans Like I was saying its nuts dude Its sometimes hard to take it all inTo get the full measure of Van Alstines journey it is important to know what the 25-year-old is not He is not a native speaker of Arabic He is not of Arab descent He had never set foot in an Arab country until he was in his early 20sBut he is Muslim raised in the religion of his Turkish-born mother as the family bounced between Turkey and the United States with the deployments of his father an Air Force enlisted airman who rose to the rank of chief master sergeantOne stop was in San Antonio shortly after Sept 11 2001 when he was in grade schoolFor the first time I felt I wasnt accepted he said Here I was a white Muslim in America Many Americans rejected me because I was Muslim The Muslims in America  Arabs Pakistanis and others  rejected me because they saw me as just American I felt really isolatedThat was until he fell into a clique of Saudi students at the University of North Texas He started picking up Arabic and the distinctive Saudi dialect One day in late 2011 from his parents basement he decided to make a video challenging Westerners to seek a better understanding of Islam He posted it on YouTubeThen he made another one with a lighter touch about hanging out with the Saudis And anotherNo one noticed on campus except the Saudi students They tweeted it Back in the kingdom the posts went into the memeosphere in one of the regions most vibrant social media landscapes Here was something entirely new a blond American winging it in Arabic with a Saudi flavor Americans are well used to foreigners expropriating US culture and slang But for Saudis it was a hootI was like You gotta be kidding right he said I was anonymous at home and like some kind of star in SaudiIn early 2012 someone from the Saudi royal court tracked down Van Alstine on Facebook and invited him to visit Van Alstine arrived just after the death of the No2 to the throne Crown Prince Nayef in June 2012 Because he was on a royal-sponsored visit Van Alstine was added to the mourning eventsHe joined the royal delegation to pray in Mecca and was part of a gathering with senior princes and others at a palace in Jiddah Among them was the future Saudi king Salman Van Alstine kissed him on the forehead a traditional display of respect by younger men for elders in Arab states of the Persian GulfVan Alstine also paid homage to his sponsors by taking the nom-de-Web Abu Muteb a nickname of then Saudi King Abdullah who died nearly a year ago and was succeeded by SalmanVan Alstine returned to the United States and kept cranking out videos for his YouTube channel Americanbadu or the American Bedouin One video  a reply to a woman who professed to be fan of the Saudi soccer club al-Ittihad  has more than 1million viewsIn May 2013 the Saudi Ministry of Education emailed him a job offer to help develop a new TV channel He packed his bags  To be sure Van Alstine keeps it tame The Saudi social media space is packed but not with anyone who crosses red lines such as criticism of Saudi rulers or policies Offenders are quickly silenced and sometimes jailedHis comedy keeps to the safe ground of mild observations the pidgin Arabic of many South Asian shopkeepers or the bewildering array of Saudi hand gestures He can also get preachy and more than a shade of propagandist In several posts  with a Saudi flag in the background  he has railed against Muslim-bashers in the West or defended Saudi Arabia against criticism of rights abuses and crackdowns on dissentI dont feel conflicted at all he said insisting that he does not try to overlay Western values on local standards This bit of self-preservation has earned him some detractorsHis father Brian Van Alstine said he was always aware of Joshuas affinity for the spotlight But Ive also tried to temper his enthusiasm with the reality that not everyone will understand or tolerate his point of view the same way he addedVan Alstines sweet spot however is his natural state a semi-goofy American with a toothy smile who favors traditional Saudi robes and headgear and models himself as a Bedouin soul mateHes weird but in a likable way said Ibraheem Alkhirallah creative director at the Riyadh-based video production company Telfaz which featured Van Alstine in one of its most popular Web shows Temsahly which features a sock-puppet crocodile who interviews Arab celebrities or has adventures around the regionThe centerpiece of the awards wall at Telfaz is a YouTube plaque for the first 1 million subscribers to Temsahly  among the shows more than 100 million views The Van Alstine episode has been watched more than 18 million timesIt is another glimpse into one of the Middle Easts fastest-evolving online cultures Saudi Arabia ranks among the worlds leaders in per capita usage of sites such as Twitter and the WhatsApp chat network Millions follow YouTube comedy shows such as Temsahly and the satirical La Yekthar ShowSaudi society can be a lonely place said Fahad Albutairi the popular comedian who created La Yekthar or put a lid on it in rough translation Liberals and conservatives men and women wealthy and struggling  all had really no way to really connect With social media we can tear off the masks and tear up the stereotypesThe same wave carried Van Alstine But his image really took off when he appeared in 2013 on a 15-episode series on Middle East Broadcasting the major regional television network during the super prime-time viewing season of Ramadan the Islamic holy month In the show Van Alstine is living with a traditional Saudi familyI arrived as a dopey American and then out-Arabized the Arabs he saidAfter his short-term TV gig Van Alstine is setting up shop in Doha He plans to resume his studies and seek new outlets in Qatar which is among the regions media hubs as the base for the Al Jazeera networkThey say that life is unpredictable he said If anyone disagrees I have the perfect answer Take a look at meBriony Whitehouse was a 19-year-old intern in 2003 when she boarded an elevator in the Russell Senate Office Building with a Republican senator who she said groped her until the doors reopenedShe never reported the incidentto her bossesfor fear of jeopardizing her career But she recently tweeted about her experience on Twitter as part of the #MeToo campaign a social-media phenomenon that hasaired thousandsof complaints about sexual harassment Some of the accounts have called out by name Hollywood moguls media stars even a  Other women such as Whitehouse have stopped short of naming harassers Whitehouse in an interview last week with The Washington Post declined to name the politician who made unwanted advances convinced that he would retaliate At the time I didnt know what to do so I did nothing at all said Whitehouse who works overseas as a political consultant Because this happened so early on for me I just assumed this was the way things worked and that Id have to accept itIf Whitehouse had chosen to pursue a complaint against the senator she would have discovered a process unlike other parts of the federal government or much of the private sector Her complaint likely would have been thrown out because interns have limited harassment protections under the unique employment law that Congress applies to itself Congress makes its own rules about the handling of sexual complaints against members and staff passing laws exempting it from practices that apply to other employers The result is a culture in which some lawmakers suspect harassment is rampant Yet victims are unlikely to come forward according to attorneys who represent themUnder a law in place since 1995 accusers may file lawsuits only if they first agree to go through  A special congressional office is charged with trying to resolve the cases out ofcourt When settlements do occur members do not pay them from their own office funds a requirement in other federal agencies Instead the confidential payments come out of a special USTreasury fundCongressional employees have received small settlements compared with the amounts some public figures pay out Between 1997 and 2014 the US Treasury has paid $152 million in 235 awards and settlements for Capitol Hill workplace violations according to the congressional Office of Compliance The statistics do not break down the exact nature of the violations Like Hollywood where allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein touched off the recent #MeToo campaign the Capitol Hill environment is dominated by powerful men who can make or break careers Congress has resisted efforts that could improve the culture such as making anti-harassment training mandatory in their officesIt is not a victim-friendly process It is an institution-protection process said Rep Jackie Speier (D-Calif) who has unsuccessfully pushed to overhaul how harassment cases are handled I think we would find that sexual harassment is rampant in the institution But no one wants to know because theyd have to do something about itWhitehouse was among thousands of women who shared stories of sexual harassment and assault online after the Weinstein allegations grabbed global attentionAlly Coll Steele a Washington lawyer shared her story about a former Democratic senator grabbing her buttocks at the Democratic National Convention in 2004 She was an 18-year-old intern and the senators wife and staff were standing nearbyI was in the position of having no choice but reacting in a way that was going to make a big deal out of it in front his staff or his wife or acting like nothing was happening I chose the latter Steele saidPeople she told about the incident said they were sorry it happened but not surprised she recalled Her colleagues had described the former senator as handsyOne former Senate staffer speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals said she was repeatedly groped at work events by a younger and more junior male staff memberHe would just grab me she said It happened multiple times The worst part was my other male colleagues would excuse it He stayed on Capitol Hill for yearsAnother former staffer described interning on the Hill at 16 while attending a local high school The offices legislative director a married man in his 40s began paying attention to her in ways that became increasingly uncomfortable adding her on AOL Instant Messenger offering her rides home saying she resembled his college girlfriend and ultimately suggesting he pick her up from school so they could havelunchWhile the man never touched her or made overtly sexual comments the former staffer said his attention was inappropriateWhat 40-something man is taking a 16-year-old woman out to lunch she saidCapitol Hill has long been known as a demanding workplace for young people trying to make a mark in an adrenaline-fueled Washington power center Work duties often require personal interactions with members and high-ranking staffers and success requires that employees demonstrate personal loyalty political solidarity and professional rapport with colleagues and superiorsMaking claims of harassment or inappropriate advances come at high riskThere is a sense that going forward with an allegation like this would be completely the end of any career working for anybody on the Hill  and it undoubtedly would be said Debra Katz an employment attorney in Washington who represents congressional aides in sexual harassment casesWe have no doubt that sexual harassment is underreported in Congress just as all workplace infractions are underreported in Congress said Brad Fitch president and chief executive of the Congressional Management Foundation a nonprofit organization that helps lawmakers and staff learn to run their officesWhen cases do emerge they can attract years of unwanted attention another disincentive for reporting attorneys saySex scandals involving current and former lawmakers have been infrequent but steady A count by The Post shows at least a dozen members have resigned or chosen not to seek reelection in the last 15 years because of extramarital affairs inappropriate contact online and other sexual misbehavior Rep Mark Foley (R-Fla) resigned in 2006 after sending sexually explicit online messages to teenage current and former male House pages The popular House program was eventually disbanded At the time Foley apologized for the conduct that it was alleged that I did He did not respond to a request for commentRep Eric Massa (D-NY) stepped down in 2010 amid allegations that he had groped and tickled male staffers At the time Massa said his actions were not sexual James D Doyle Massas attorney said federal investigations have not found the former congressman committed any wrongdoing whatsoeverIn 2015 Rep Blake Farenthold (R-Tex) settled a sexual harassment charge brought by his former communications director Lauren Greene who said he made inappropriate comments designed to gauge whether [she] was interested in a sexual relationship according to her legal complaint Farenthold denied wrongdoing Greene filed the lawsuit after participating in counseling and mediation Neither she nor Farentholds office responded to requests for commentCases involving high-ranking congressional staffers get far less notice Female staffers in the office of Rep Mark Meadows (R-NC) alleged former chief of staff Kenny West behaved inappropriately toward women One former female staffer interviewed by the Office of Congressional Ethics said West would play with womens hair and try to look down their shirts according to an interview transcript West was moved into an advisory position before he left Meadowss office permanentlyWest denied inappropriate behavior and said the allegations have hurt him professionally He said that he is old-fashioned and that the situation could best be described as a misunderstanding between him and female aides There was never any sexual harassment and had there been any by anyone the congressman Mrs Meadows myself and my wife  we would not tolerate it he said in an interviewMeadowss office did not respond to a request for commentKatz said women who are harassed in congressional jobs contact her every few months to learn about their rightsWeve worked with a number of women who after these experiences stopped working on Capitol Hill Katz said They were done They felt so betrayedVictims who do seek action face a confusing process under a law known as the Congressional Accountability Act that was put in place in 1995 Sponsored by Sen Charles E Grassley (R-Iowa) it imposed a range of civil rights labor and worker-safety laws on Capitol Hill for the first timeA scandal involving Sen Robert Packwood (R-Ore) and multiple women accusers led to his 1995 resignation and to debate over which labor protections should apply to Congress Packwood first denied the allegations but later apologized Following the Packwood allegations a 1993 survey by The Post showed that one-third of female congressional employees responding said they were sexually harassed by members supervisors lobbyists or fellow aidesGrassleys bill established the 20-person Office of Compliance to adjudicate disputes and handle harassment complaintsThe law gives victims 180 days after the offending incident to initiate complaints Victims must agree to go through counseling which take typically takes 30daysAfter that victims who want to continue begin 30 days of mediation which is handled by a neutral mediator If the problem is still unresolved they can pursue an OOC administrative hearing or file a federal lawsuit against their harasserThe confidential dispute resolution process can be made public only if the case is ruled in the victims favor after it goes through administrative or judicial proceedingsThe OOC contends that its process has helped resolve scores of employee disputes and benefits all sidesSome advocates believe the pre-lawsuit mediation requirement undercuts victims The rule contrasts sharply with the rest of the federal government where mediation is an option but not mandatory for employees to pursue legal actionFew staffers seem aware of their rights or the harassment reporting processA lot of people are confused about it Well get calls from people who work down on the Hill and theyre not all that clear as to what they should be doing said Alan Lescht an employment attorney in Washington who handles harassment cases involving federal and congressional employeesThe only mandatory training for congressional employees is an ethics program put into place after the 2006 Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal and instruction on cybersecurity The lack of mandatory anti-harassment training places Congress out of step with the majority of the private sector according to human-resources expertsThe OOC sends newsletters and regular emails urging chiefs of staff to prioritize staff training and describing how to access resources online While the office oversees tens of thousands of employees only about 800 people since 2015 have taken its 20-minute online tutorial on preventing sexual harassmentSome congressional leaders have been questioned about the culture on Capitol Hill amid a national outcry over allegations of serial harassment by Weinstein Grassley told The Post this week that if the law is not effectively accomplishing sexual harassment prevention and anti-discriminatory training then it should be revisitedHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) said members need to take responsibility for anti-harassment training in their own offices A 2014 effort led by Speier to make training mandatory was defeated but Pelosi told The Post she supports Speiers efforts On Thursday Rep Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich) introduced a bill to require sexual-harassment trainingSen Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) who has spoken about her own experience with sexual harassment in Congress said she supports mandatory sexual harassment training for every member of Congress and their staffHouse Speaker Paul D Ryan (R-Wis) recently said that it would be naive to suggest sexual harassment doesnt happen on Capitol Hill and that current systems can always be improved His office declined to offer moredetailsI do believe that exposing these things can help improve the culture Ryan said in an interview on MSNBC The more you expose it and the more we can castigate people in society on these things to show that this is not acceptable behavior I think thats to the goodSpeier said members need to be held more accountable Its an embarrassment she said and weve got to fix it

endured a day of scrutiny and mockery when in December he released an over-the-top doctors letter proclaiming his laboratory test results to be astonishingly excellent and asserting that at 70 he will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidencyAt the time the Associated Press described the four-paragraph document authoredby Dr Harold Bornstein as sparse on details and written in similar language to that used by Trump himselfCNN casting doubt on the credibility of the healthiest individual ever elected claim noted that Bornstein is not believed to have evaluated any past presidentsThe New York Times highlighted Bornsteins poor writing reporting that the note begins as an open letter To Whom My Concern apparently meaning To whom it may concern Here at The Fix Philip Bump diagnosed Bornstein with a case of  writing that Trumps hyperbole is itself a disease  and its contagiousBut the medias attention quickly shifted from the letter to the  The doctors note was mostly forgottenUntil nowCNN medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta reported Tuesday that Bornstein exaggerated his qualifications when signing the letter as a fellow of the American College of Gastroenterology and a member of the gastroenterology department at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York In fact Bornstein has not been an ACG fellow since 1995 and though he does have admitting privileges at Lenox Hill he is not on staff thereGuptas report included some of the same observations chronicled last week in a  by Jen Gunter a San Francisco doctor whose piece was  among othersGupta appeared on various CNN programs Tuesday revisiting variousholes in the letter that were covered last year the lack of evidence to support claims about Trumps good health and the unprofessional writing style most notablyAlso Tuesday the New York Times ran a front-page reportthatnoted the letter from Trumps physician contained no details about his heart rate respiratory rate cholesterol level past medications or family medical historyThe doctor Harold N Bornstein of Manhattan concluded that Mr Trump if victorious will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency  a claim that was widely mocked as unprovable and unscientific the Times addedTrump brought this renewed scrutiny on himself by harping on the idea that his 68-year-old opponent Hillary Clinton is not physically or mentally fitto be president He and his surrogates have sought to make health a big issue lately claiming the Democratic nomineelacks  and looks  Trump ally Matt Drudge seems obsessed with Clintons medical condition these days and others in the conservative media have made wild diagnoses ranging from Parkinsons disease to radiation poisoningIt was inevitable then that journalists would return to questions about Trumps own constitution  Trump has a bad habit of reviving negative stories through his own antics He seemingly put the ugly Megyn Kelly feud behind him in May and weathered criticism for mocking a reporter with a physical disability last fall then  His initial attack on a Latino judge  blew over quickly but he made things harder on himself in June when he toldthe that the judge had an absolute conflict in presiding over a case involvingTrump University because he is of Mexican heritageRemember when Vladimir Putin called Trump last year You might not have except Trump said at a news conference last month that  triggering an avalanche of new stories about the mutual admiration between the billionaire and the dictatorTrump has been slamming Clinton all week over potential conflicts of interest presented by her familys foundation You can bet a wave of stories about possible conflicts involving the Trump organization are on the way When it hits Trump will have himself to blameCritical coverage is unavoidable for any candidate but most are happy to have the mediamove on to other subjects Trump however is proving once again that his ability to put past controversies back in the headlines is astonishingly excellentOf the  proposed in House Republicans plan released this week few areproving to be as contentiousas the cut to the mortgage interest deduction (MID)Underthe proposal homeowners would only be able to deduct interest on the first $500000 of mortgage debt half of the current $1 million threshold The change wouldnot affect existing mortgages only mortgages on purchases made after the law is in forceOwners of expensive homes would still be able to take the deduction on their first $500000 of mortgage debt If you have a $550000 mortgage for instance youd be able to deduct the interest on all but the last $50000 of principal owedThat hasnt stopped realtors and home builders groupsfrom slamming the proposalcalling it an  living in expensive areas like DC and San Francisco The nations 13 million Realtors cannot support a bill that takes homeownership off the table for millions of middle-class families said William Brown president of the National Association of Realtors Similarly Granger MacDonald of the National Association of Home Builders the bill eviscerates existing housing tax benefits by drastically reducing the number of home owners who can take advantage of mortgage interest and property tax incentivescapping mortgage interest at $500000 for new home purchases means that home buyers in expensive markets will effectively lose this housing tax benefit moving forwardThe rhetoric about middle-class families is largely at odds with the reality of who actually owns half-million dollar homes in the USNationwide only about 6 percent of new mortgages are valued at over $500000 according to  a groupthat advocates for reforming theMID and making housing more affordable for low-income families That figure is based on an analysis of mortgages issued in the United States between 2013 and 2015 If your mortgage is over $500000 in other words youre already in the top tier of American homeownersThe fraction of households affected by the proposed MID change is significantly smaller than the 6 percent figure would seem to suggest Nationwide approximately 639 percent of families own their own homes  Data from the  and  indicate about 65 percent of homeowners owe at least some money on their mortgagesSo in a very back-of-the-envelope fashion we can say the followingroughly 42 percent of American families (or 65 percent of the 639 percent who are homeowners) are paying off a mortgage If 6 percent of them have a mortgage over $500000 that means approximately 25 percent of Americans are paying mortgages on homes valued at $500000 or moreIf half-million dollar homes account for a small portion of the mortgage market in other words they affect an even smaller share of the total US population That share of the population is likely to be fairly well-off if you can afford a down payment and monthly payments on an $600000 house for instance youre not exactly struggling financiallyThere is no policy rationale for the federal government to continue to subsidize mortgages of more than $500000said the National Low-Income Housing Coalition in  Certainly the few people who can afford to borrow more than $500000 in home mortgages can afford to pay more in taxesIt is true in terms of housing a half-million dollars means very different things in different parts of the country In northern Minnesota for instance  In San Francisco on the other hand it gets you Regardless of where youre buying that $600000 home under the GOP proposal youd still be able to deduct roughly 5/6ths or 83 percent of your total mortgage interest  thats because you still deduct the interest on the first $500000 of your mortgage value that means youd be paying about $1700 more annually under the GOP proposal  a bummer to be sure but not exactly a bank-breaking figure formost families that can afford to pay over $3000 on principal and interest aloneFurther compounding the issuethe mortgage interest deduction is one of the reasons home prices across the country are so expensive to begin with A  by economists at MIT Princeton and the University of Copenhagen concluded mortgage interest deduction induces homeowners to buy larger and more expensive housesThat paper also found the MID has a precisely estimated zero effect on the of homeownership  people who can afford to buy a house will do so regardless of whether a mortgage interest deduction is in placeIts hard to square those findings and the overall modest impacts of the GOP proposals mortgage interest change with the apocalyptic rhetoric (eviscerates existing housing tax benefits) coming from its opponentsStill even supporters of the change arent happy the savings from it are primarily being used to Diane Yentel president and chief executive at National Low Income Housing Coalition said in an email Congress should reinvest the savings from the MID reform into affordable housing solutions like the national Housing Trust Fund rental assistance or a renters credit that would help the lowest income people in AmericaThe Washington regions middle class would be one of the groups hardest hit by a to cut in half the top mortgage interest deduction used by American homeownersThe proposal unveiled Thursday sayshomeowners would be able to deduct interest payments made on only their first $500000 worth of home loans Under the current law  on mortgages of up to $1 millionPersonally I think it would impact the middle class drastically said Nicholas Lagos a real estate broker at Century 21 Gawen Realtyin Arlington I dont think it would have much of an effect on the upper class the people in the $3 million and $4 million homes Its not going to impact them one bit The people who are your regular middle-class people    it will impact them  Prices are high in the Washington area  for example the median sale price for a home in Bethesda is $872500 according to ShowingTime RBI based on listing activity from Bright MLS That means many homeowners take out substantial mortgages when buying their homesIf you think about a $1 million mortgage said Laly Kassa managing director at Chevy Chase Trust in the initial years that interest expense is in the $30000 range Having that capped is going to have an impact    For the younger clients there it will have a really significant impact Its like losing a third of that deduction For younger families there it will impact what they buy and what they spend their discretionary funds on Thats $10000 out the door right at the inception of a mortgage  ATTOM Data Solutions a real estate data and analytics firm found that the District Maryland and Virginia are among the 10 jurisdictions with the highest percentage of mortgages above $500000 In the District 35 percent of all mortgages are for more than $500000 In Maryland 9 percent of mortgages are for more than $500000 in Virginia 8 percent areLoudoun County has the largest average home mortgage deduction in the country according to an  Homeowners in Loudoun County who itemize their deductions deduct an average of $6365 on their income taxes Six of the top 10areas for average home mortgage interest deductions are in the Washington region They are Loudoun Falls Church ($5450) Fairfax County ($4805) Calvert County ($4677) Stafford County ($4667) and Howard County ($4656)What that proposal is not doing is it is not making adjustments for areas that are not necessarily affluent but expensive areas Lagos saidSome Republicans argued that other tax breaks would offset the loss of the mortgage interest deduction The tax plan proposes for instance an elimination of the alternative minimum tax and a lowering of the individual tax ratesHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex) noted that because the GOPs tax plan also proposes to double the standard deduction for couples to $24000 and revise individual income brackets there is tax relief for Americans regardless of where they liveBut Chevy Chase-based broker Hans Wydler of Wydler Brothers Real Estate questions the motivation of the capFor a long time the government encouraged homeownership Wydler said Multiple presidents on both sides of the aisle talked about how important it is Its the American Dream This is against that which is fine if theyre changing what the objective is If the American Dream what they defined it before is no longer relevant thats fine    Just articulate it But theyre saying Yes we want the American Dream but they are attacking it economically Its just sort of bizarreThe bill also would limit the amount homeowners are allowed to deduct in local property taxes from their taxable income The House Republican proposal caps thisdeduction at $10000The benefit of the mortgage interest deduction goes away for most people over time said Danielle Hale chief economist at Realtorcom But the property tax benefit continues year after year She said that most property tax rates in this area are 1 percent or highermeaning a $10000 cap would affect people with home valuesof $1 million or more That is going to affect a much larger share of people in this area The tax savings you get from taking a property tax deduction is not quite as large generally as the mortgage interest deduction but it will still be noticeableThe National Association of Realtors and the National Association of Home Builders have vowed to use their lobbying power to save the mortgage interest deductionThats a very important deduction one of the few deductions we have left Lagos said That is an important subsidy to a homeowner especially to a dual-income family with children or anyone who is buying in this area    I really think in this particular case that they need to focus on continuing to allow the middle class to continue to prosper instead of penalizing them for living in metropolitan areasCOLUMBUS Ohio  Sherrod Brown won seven terms in the US House and two terms in the Senate by campaigning against job killing international trade deals He has prodded presidents from both parties over their support for NAFTA CAFTA and expanded trade with China But he has never in nearly 25 years in Washington actually won a congressional battle over a major trade agreementThis year it looks like that losing streak will endThe politics of globalization have swung quickly and decisively in favor of Brown and his populist allies A massive trade deal is close to death in Congress Washingtons long-running romance with freer trade is on the rocksThats partly due to the battle Brown and like-minded lawmakers have waged against trade agreements for decades And its partly due to Donald Trump His core supporters like the union-proud Democrats who love Brown have rebelled against trade deals and many Republican politicians have followed their leadA bipartisan surge of grass-roots anger over lost jobs and displaced workers has driven the shiftSundays presidential debate will likely highlight how opposition to trade deals has become the safe position for a Democratic or Republican presidential hopeful Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton focused much of their economic discussion at the first debate on trade with both coming out hard against the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement now languishing in CongressThe TPP as it is known is a 12-nation trade deal negotiated and pushed by the Obama administration The Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) said recently that it will not get a vote this yearIf that proves true and TPP fails to pass in the lame-duck session after the election advocates on all sides agree the next president is almost certain to let it die in its current form That is true of Trump and signs  public and private  point to it being true for Clinton despite Trumps repeated claims that she would embrace the TPP if electedWere winning on TPP Brown said sounding more optimistic on a trade fight than he has in 10 years of interviews with this reporter The country already was there Its just the elected officials and candidates are catching upMost Americans probably would not notice an immediate effect if the deal fails Supporters predict it would boost economic growth (a claim challenged by critics) but only by a modest amount over the next decadeWhen Brown Ohios perpetually rumpled senior senator first ran for his seat in 2006 on a trade-centered platform several Democratic strategists privately warned the issue couldnt move voters in a statewide race A decade later both Clinton and Trump are centering their pitches to the swing-states middle-class voters on opposition to trade in speeches that often sound directly sourced from Browns playbook ()This comes as concerns in both parties are growing about the health of Americas middle class and with the mounting struggles of large business groups to push some of their top economic priorities including the TPP through CongressYouve got a whole political party now thats willing to think and talk about it thats changed it Brown said speaking of Republicans Washington Democrats he added have gone from 2 to 1 against to now four five six to one against these trade agreementsPolls can send conflicting messages on how Americans view trade deals but they tend to show a few clear trends in recent years New data out this week from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs are a good example They show Democrats have grown more supportive of trade as it affects the US economy broadly during the Obama years Republicans have grown less supportiveBut the survey also shows majorities in both parties remain deeply critical of trade as it pertains to American workers Just 2 in 5 Americans agree that trade has been good for creating US jobs Only about 1 in 3 say it has been good for Americans job securityThose concerns appear to weigh heavily on presidential primary voters Clinton fended off her primary opponent longtime trade critic Bernie Sanders in part by diving into specific critiques of parts of the TPP agreement a strategy her aides say helped her win the Ohio primaryWhile a shrinking pool of centrist Democrats maintain hope that Clinton would reverse course and support the agreement if she won the White House  especially since she once supported it in early stages when she was secretary of state  she and her closest advisers are emphatic She will not flipBrown has criticized Obama and former president Bill Clinton on trade and he appears willing to stake his trade legacy on Hillary Clinton breaking from them as president Im certain of it he said She understands these issues Weve talked about them She understands them in depth and she feels themTrumps central economic message through the primaries and the general election campaign has been to threaten tariffs against China Mexico and other trading partners and promise to return millions of manufacturing jobs to the United States by renegotiating trade deals His advisers say such moves would reduce Americas trade deficit and increase economic growth meanwhile a recent survey of top economists found that none of them believed tariffs would be good for the economyWe will win this election Trump told an Ohio crowd in August and we will keep America out of the TPPDavid B Cohen a political-science professor at the University of Akron and longtime observer of Ohio politics said it is shocking to see how a Republican candidate has essentially co-opted what traditionally is a progressive Democratic issue But the timing he added is no surprise A lot of voters especially in Rust Belt states a lot of blue collar workers feel left behindOhio lost more than 400000 factory jobs from the late 1990s through the depths of the Great Recession before regaining 75000 of them in the current recovery Many Ohio politicians have long blamed trade for many of those lossesA Democratic congressman Tom Sawyer lost his seat in 2002 after voting in favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement Brown unsuccessfully fought that agreement NAFTA as a freshman congressman He also fought against the Central American Free Trade Agreement and agreements with individual countries such as South KoreaBrown used trade to pummel his incumbent Republican opponent Mike DeWine in the 2006 campaign that vaulted him to the Senate Many Democratic strategists in the state privately worried the strategy would backfire DeWine was eager to attack Brown on the issue particularly the importance to Ohio companies of exportsSherrod thinks you can build a wall around the state of Ohio DeWine said in a debate televised live on NBCs Meet the Press that October He added When it comes time to protect Ohio industries hes not therePro-trade Democrats have long learned not to try to sway Brown on the issue If youre depending on having Sherrod Browns vote on a trade deal said Jim Kessler of the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way you dont have a theory of winning But he has sometimes frustrated the Obama administration on trade and Obama has frustrated himIn Ohios 2008 Democratic presidential primary both he and Clinton pledged to renegotiate NAFTA  Brown was upbeat The winner Hillary or Barack will come to Congress [as president] with a different trade policy he said in a 2008 interview Theyll follow throughInstead Obama disappointed Brown and other trade critics by pushing the TPP agreement as a capstone economic and diplomatic achievement The agreement appeared headed for a narrow victory after Obama won fast track trade authority from Congress last year But then came the primaries and the rise of Sanders and Trump and Clintons hardening line against the agreementThe margins for  the fast-track measure cleared the House by just 10 votes last year with only 28 Democrats supporting it Since then several Republicans have reversed course and said they would oppose the final agreementIts still alive Its not easy but then again I cant remember a trade vote thats been easy said Linda Dempsey vice president of international economic affairs for the National Association of Manufacturers Everybody who wants to get this done believes lame duck absolutely is the best opportunityObama has pushed the pact in order to embed America more firmly in the worlds fastest-growing and most populous region and to counter the growing regional influence of China On a tour of Asia recently he told reporters that I believe [the TPP] will be ratified because its the right thing to do but acknowledged the political difficulties Well have to cut through the noise once election season is over he saidDempsey and several other trade advocates see little hope that Clinton or Trump would move the agreement as president Obama took a trade-skeptical position in 2008 under the same pressures [Clinton] is facing said Will Marshall the president of the centrist Progressive Policy Institute in Washington But they werent as intense then as they are now Theres a populist anti-globalist fever spreadingThat spread is both a vindication for trade-deal opponents particularly organized labor leaders and also a threat to the Democratic candidates they traditionally support Union leaders have blanketed Ohio this election season holding news conferences to denounce Trump as a fraud on the issue largely because his own companies have frequently outsourced production work to other countriesBrown is more brutal on Trumps trade stance  he has no understanding of it no depth on it is a hypocrite about it  and optimistic that 2016 will prove a tipping point on the issueAfter all so much else appears to be swinging his way In June he saw a Cleveland sports team the Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association win the towns first professional championship since 1964 He believes the citys baseball team the Indians will win the World Series this month And then a Clinton win he predicts and the defeat of TPPThis year he said is really going to be the yearJawaher has lived in this tiny nation her whole life But a political showdown threatens to unravel her world potentially forcing her to move to a country she hardly knows and splitting her family apartJawahers mother is a Qatari citizen and her father is BahrainiThat fact seldom has caused problems But when several other Arab nations  last week three of them  Bahrain Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates  also ordered their citizens to return home or face stiff penaltiesUnder the laws of Qatar and other Persian Gulf countries children take the citizenship of their father That leaves Jawaher and thousands of others like her with a difficult decisionIf we are made to go to Bahrain what are we going to do there said the 21-year-old university student who spoke on the condition that her family name not be revealed because she feared repercussions And we are going to have to leave our mom behindOur family will be dividedIn a region where cultural and tribal ties extend beyond national borders  is creating havoc in Qatari families like Jawahers in ways many had never expectedParents and spouses traveling abroad are unable to return home Some have already lost jobs Children worry about becoming stateless or that their education will be disrupted and family members in different countries are feuding Theres a collective sense that they are trapped by the quest for influence and control in the Middle EastWe have relatives all over the region said Rashed al-Jalahma 22 who is also the child of a Qatari-Bahraini union We were in shock and awe when we learned we can no longer see them because of politics What does the population have to do with the problems of the politicians  On June 5 Saudi Arabia Bahrain and the UAE ordered Qatari nationals to leave their territories within 14 days and banned their own citizens from entering Qatar Citizens living in Qatar were given a similar deadline to returnMore than 11000 citizens of the three countries live in Qatar according to Qatars National Human Rights Committee And thousands of Qataris live and work in Saudi Arabia Bahrain and the UAE At least 6500 Qatari nationals are married to citizens from these three nations according to Qatari government figuresBefore the crisis citizens of the six-country Gulf Cooperation Council or GCC  which includes Saudi Arabia the UAE Bahrain Qatar Kuwait and Oman  could live and travel freely across the member states They often refer to themselves as Khaleejis  the people of the GulfTensions however between Qatar and its neighbors have been simmering for years over accusations that Qatar supports terrorist groups and Qatars ties to Irans Shiite theocracy the primary rival of Saudi Arabias Sunni monarchy That led to last weeks expulsions of diplomats and the closing of ports airspace and borders to isolate QatarThe small energy-rich nation home to  and 10000 US service members has rejected the allegations as baseless saying that it condemns terrorism in all its formsFew here expected such a full-blown crisis especially as millions in the region prepare to celebrate the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan a time to visit families and friendsThis has made me so sad said Wafa al-Yazeedi a Qatari doctor and Jalahmas mother We lived and felt like all the Gulf is one country I have a cousin everywhereShe divorced her Bahraini husband when her three children were small He returned to Bahrain and her children grew up here with little contact with their father or other relativesNow the children are in a dilemmaSettling in Bahrain means leaving behind their mother other relatives lifelong friends  and their expensive university educations for which the Qatari government paysStaying in Qatar could result in statelessness if Bahrain takes away their citizenship Qatar has allowed citizens from Bahrain Saudi Arabia and the UAE living here to remain and provides free health care and other services if their mother is QatariStill being stateless would limit their future opportunities especially if they want to travel abroad for more studies or workThey are controlling us with the passport said Jalahma an aeronautical engineering student If the Kingdom of Bahrain revokes my citizenship so be it  I am not worried about losing my passport but my concerns are about my studies  The crisis has already had immediate consequences In a report last week the human rights watchdog Amnesty International described the case of a Saudi man living in Qatar who was unable to visit his hospitalized mother in Saudi Arabia because he feared he would not be able to return to his children and Qatari wifeJawahers family is already divided at least temporarily Her father was on a work trip in Bahrain when the crisis erupted and he has been stuck there ever since Theres no way now for him to come back she saidOn Sunday Saudi Arabia Bahrain and the UAE said they had created hotlines to help families who face separation but gave few details Qatars National Human Rights Committee dismissed the move as little more than a face-saving exercise Amnesty International called the measures vague and insufficientSome affected families worry that the hotlines are ways to gather data on those who complain Both Bahrain and the UAE last week declared it a crime to criticize their policies toward Qatar or show sympathy with Qatar  offenses that carry multi-year jail sentencesIts fake said Yazeedi referring to Bahrains hotline I cannot trust them I wont call them from my numberIn Omar al-Ansaris family the crisis has struck in multiple ways His sister and her family  all Qataris  arrived two days earlier after being ordered to leave Saudi Arabia where they had studied and worked for six years Now she and her husband need to find new jobs and schools for their five childrenLast week the familys divisions erupted on their WhatsApp chat forum with an aunt in Bahrain criticizing Qatar and its policies and the Qatari side of the family denouncing Bahrain and its alliesOur family in Bahrain thinks Qatar is wrong and we think they are not said Ansari 23 a university senior whose mother is Qatari and father is Bahraini Thats causing friction between our families Its not a nice situation to be inHis Bahraini identification card has expired So has his Qatari one But he cant renew his Qatari ID unless he has a valid one from Bahrain And if he travels there he wont be allowed to return because of his citizenshipSo he cant open up a bank account get a new phone or a new drivers license  which also recently expired  or access other government servicesIm kind of stuck Ansari said Jia Naqvi contributed to this reportMalala Yousafzai the Pakistani schoolgirl who survived being

schools is so hard  Malala has since continued speaking out against both Muslim extremists who are  and those who would discriminate against Muslims  including the newly inaugurated presidentIn December 2015 when Trump first called for a Muslim ban early in the presidential campaign Malala decried his comments as full of hatredWell thats really tragic that you hear these comments which are full of hatred full of this ideology of being discriminative towards others Others at the time who denounced Trumps proposed ban included Muhammad Ali Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Republican House Speaker Paul D Ryan (Wis) More importantly  its not what this country stands forSYDNEY  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met here Monday with senior Australian officials stressing that despite the Trump administrations withdrawal from key environmental and trade agreements the relationship between their countries will remain strongTillerson asked what he will do to address pockets of doubt about American isolationism under President Trump said thats why were here Despite Trump withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and then the Paris climate agreement last week the two countries will remain closely aligned on many issues Tillerson said  In terms of addressing those concerns this is how we address them to travel to the region to meet with our counterparts and to talk about all the issues that are important to them and to hear concerns they have about the administration and its position relative to whether it be security issues or economic and trade issues he saidMattis citing Australias early assistance to the United States in the war in Afghanistan said Australia always is punching above its weight in protecting values and indicated Australia is not shy about expressing its point of viewThis is an alliance that tells us what we need to hear not just what we want to hear he saidMattis and Tillerson appeared together at a news conference for the first time standing with Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop and Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne amid the Gothic architecture of Sydneys Government House an iconic building down under They were to meet afterward for dinner with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull before Mattis returned to Washington and Tillerson moved on to visit officials in New ZealandTillerson addressing Trumps decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement put distance between himself and the president on the issue But he also stressed that Trump is still willing to discuss new deals on trade and the climate that he believes are more beneficial to the American publicI think the presidents decision to leave the climate accord was his judgment that the agreement did not serve the American people well and that it did not serve their future economic interests either he saidBishop said that she should point out that Australia has its own views on its priorities and interests and as it happens they align so often with those of the United StatesWe have shared values shared interests she said But Australia always takes our own interests into accountTrump got off to a rocky start with Australia with the president abruptly ending a testy phone call with Turnbull within days of taking office US officials said The president was frustrated about a deal that former president Barack Obama made with Australia to take about 1200 refugees after security vetting  But Turnbull and Trump met in New York in May reaffirming their relationship and the refugee agreement while saying that reports about the phone call were exaggeratedOn Friday Turnbull appeared at the Shangri-La Dialogue a defense conference in Singapore and said that while Trumps decision to withdraw from the TPP trade deal and the Paris agreement were disappointing other Pacific nations should take care not to rush to interpret an intent to engage on different terms as one not to engage at allMattis meanwhile sought to reassure allies in the Pacific about Trumps decisions in Singapore Asked about Trumps withdrawal from TPP and the Paris agreement and his brusque stance toward the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Mattis said fresh approaches will be taken following the US election but the United States will continue to be a world leaderMattis cited American lessons learned following isolationism before World War II and cited a quote often attributed to former British Prime Minister Winston ChurchillTo quote a British observer of us from some years ago Bear with us Once we have exhausted all possible alternatives the Americans will do the right thing Mattis said So we will still be there And we will be with youHe talked about Islam He thundered against extremism But after President Trumps hotly anticipated speech in Saudi Arabia was over Sunday many in the Arab world latched on to another theme from his address one that explained why a leader who had shown hostility toward Muslims would travel to the religions birthplaceThe answer The bottom line This summit has nothing to do with security Its all about business said Khalid Kilany a 28-year-old engineer in Cairo reflecting the views of an Arab public that had taken note of the vast sums  in arms sales and other business deals  that were announced during Trumps visit  The trip had delivered more power to the Saudi royal family More money to the US Case closed Kilany saidThere was broad agreement that the presidents visit signaled a change in tone toward the region and from Trumps own previously strident anti-Muslim rhetoric It was well-received among the assortment of monarchs and leaders who sat in the audience Sunday under crystal chandeliers grateful for a show of solidarity from an American president as well as his promise not to meddle in their affairsBeyond the gilded ballroom there was also plenty of skepticism about the close US embrace of Saudi Arabia  that made it an awkward stage for a speech about the dangers of radicalism As he arrived in hisHumvee on Sunday in the Iraqi city of Mosul where mortars fell nearby Master Sgt Dhu-Alfuqar Ali a member of Iraqs elite counterterrorism unit said that Trump should not have delivered the speech in Saudi Arabia where they are supporting terrorismHe should have come here to where the actual war is taking place he said speaking of a place that by a country mile had suffered most grievously from extremist groups such as the Islamic State   Views were different in the Persian Gulf region where leaders had complained resentfully about the Obama administrations neglect and its occasional scolding about human rights abuses as well as its outreach to IranWhen President Barack Obama delivered his address to the Muslim world in Cairo in June 2009 it contained a passage about democracy that surely rankled Arab leaders and may have haunted them nearly two years later when they faced protests from their own restive populationsThere was no scolding Sunday Trump spoke respectfully about Muslims and the GCC countries said Abdelkhaleq Abdulla a professor of political science from the United Arab Emirates referring to states that belong to the Gulf Cooperation CouncilVery candid very articulate said Abdulla who was especially heartened that Trump had singled out Iran for criticism He worried though that Trumps mercurial personality might mean a sudden change in course And Trumps refusal to mention the lack of freedom in the Arab world was a valid criticism he saidThis is the Trump America It is interest-based not value-based Abdulla said Until we go to the post-ISIS era no one is in the mood to talk about anything else he said using an acronym for the Islamic StateKhlood Mohammed 25 a Saudi student said she was pleasantly surprised particularly by Trumps acknowledgment of Saudi efforts to fight terrorism But Madawi al-Rasheed a visiting professor at the Middle East Center of the London School of Economics said the Trump only recognizes regimes who can pay for a wide range of US services military economic and otherwise she wrote in the online Middle East Eye He believes in their pockets rather than their faith For better or worse Trumps visit  the pageantry the personalities and the bizarre contradictions  captivated the region In Libya Ahmed Tabawi Wardako a southern tribal leader managed to catch the address  I am not a huge fan of Trump but his speech spoke to the heart of many Muslims he said suggesting it revealed the US presidents true intentions He didnt want us to come to America but he ended up coming to us Wardako said referring to Trumps inclusion of Libya on a list of Muslim-majority nations banned from travel to the United States as well as to his anti-Muslim statementsI think he said all that just to fool the American voters Trump is with the Muslims now he saidMany others though were left scrambling to respond to Trumps speech  his most expansive comments yet on Middle East policy or to divine its meaningFawzi Barhoum a spokesman for Hamas a Palestinian militant group that governs the Gaza Strip said the group rejected Trumps association of the group with the Islamic State and al-QaedaHamas is a national liberation movement legally defending the Palestinian peoples rights he said The speech he added ruins the reputation of the Palestinian resistanceThere was also anger in Iran singled out for criticism by Trump with no mention of the Iranian presidential election last week that turned out tens of millions of voters and dealt a blow to the countrys hard-linersThe riposte came from Javad Zarif Irans foreign minister Fresh from real elections  attacked by @POTUS in that bastion of democracy & moderation he  in a dig at Saudi Arabia Irans regional rival Foreign Policy or simply milking [Saudi Arabia] of $480B he addedIn Syria activists in rebel-held territory said they gathered around a friends laptop to watch Trumps speech hoping for clues about his strategy to help end the civil war Youssef al-Masri an electrician from the Aleppo countryside said the speech hit the right notes but left the room confused He is right to condemn the radicals who have destroyed our country I wonder if he really sees people like us who need his help as any different to the radicals he said citing the refugee ban and increasing reports of civilian casualties in US bombing raidsThen there was Yemen site of one of the Arab worlds bloodiest and most tragic armed conflicts which Trump referred to only obliquely as a theater of influence for Iran  even though his Saudi hosts lead an Arab coalition fighting there and play a predominant role in the continuation of the war But the Saudis definitely want a freer hand in the conflict said Farea al-Muslimi head of the Beirut-based Sanaa Center for Strategic Studies making it unlikely that Trump would have spoken out forcefully for a settlementThe president had three priorities in Saudi Arabia Muslimi said Deals deals and deals Mahfouz reported from Cairo Mustafa Salim and Thomas Gibbons-Neff in Mosul Sheikha Aldosary in Riyadh Saudi Arabia Louisa Loveluck and Suzan Haidamous in Beirut Heba Habib and Erin Cunningham in Istanbul Sufian Taha and Ruth Eglash in Jerusalem Hazem Balousha in Gaza and Sudarsan Raghavan in Tripoli Libya contributed to this reportNEW YORK  President Trump warned the United Nations in a speech Tuesday that the world faces great peril from rogue regimes with powerful weapons and terrorists with expanding reach across the globe and called on fellow leaders to join the United States in the fight to defeat what he called failed or murderous ideologies and loser terroristsWe meet at a time of immense promise and great peril Trump  in  to more than 150 international delegations at the annual UN General Assembly It is up to us whether we will lift the world to new heights or let it fall into a valley of disrepairThe presidents address was  around the world for signs of how his administration would engage with the United Nations after he had criticized the organization during his campaign as being bloated and ineffective and threatened to slash US fundingTrump offered a hand to fellow leaders but also called on them to embrace national sovereignty and to do more to ensure the prosperity and security of their own countries Over and over he stressed the rights and roles of strong sovereign nations even as they band together at the United Nations  I will always put America first just like you the leaders of your countries should put your countries first Trump said returning to a campaign theme and the America First phrase that has been criticized as isolationist and nationalisticThe president warned of growing threats from  and Iran and he said The scourge of our planet is a group of rogue regimesThe North Korean delegation was seated by chance in the front row mere feet from the UN podiumTrump praised the United Nations for enacting economic sanctions on Pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests But he emphasized that if Kim Jong Uns regime continued to threaten the United States and to destabilize East Asia his administration would be prepared to defend the country and its alliesThe United States has great strength and patience but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea Trump said before calling Kim by a nickname he gave the dictator on Twitter over the weekend Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himselfTrump added If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few then evil will triumph  Trump is scheduled to have a trilateral meeting Wednesday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in to discuss the situation He spoke separately with Chinese President Xi Jinping who is not attending this years General AssemblyFollowing the speech White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders sought to temper the idea that Trumps remarks about North Korea were a break from past US policyPresidents have always been clear to deter threats We could obviously destroy North Korea with our arsenals - last year Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) Trump also called the UN-backed Iran nuclear deal one of the worst and most one-sided agreements ever and an embarrassment to the United States His voice rising Trump strongly hinted that his administration could soon declare Tehran out of compliance That could potentially unravel the accord Trump and his top aides have been critical of Iran for its support of terrorism in the Middle EastI dont think youve heard the end of it Trump saidIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu beamed as he and his wife Sara listened to Trump speak The Israeli leader an opponent of the international nuclear deal with Iran was also addressing the world body later Tuesday a day earlier than usual because he is leaving the gathering in time to spend the Jewish holy days in Israel  In more than 30 years of my acquaintance with the UN I have not heard a more courageous and sharp speech Netanyahu a former Israeli ambassador to the body said after Trumps remarks President Trump told the truth about the dangers lurking in the world and called to face them forcefully to ensure the future of mankindIn a meeting with media executives Tuesday shortly before Trumps address Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Iran has complied fully with its commitmentsunder the nuclear deal and predicted the United States will be the loser if it tramples upon the 2015agreementEveryone will clearly see that Iran has lived up to its agreements and that the United States is therefore a country that cannot be trusted Rouhani saidWe will be the winners he added while the United States will certainly sustain lossesRouhani also seemed to suggest a US withdrawal would free Iran from its obligations under the deal which lifted nuclear-related sanctions in exchange for limits on its nuclear programIt will mean that this agreement has seen a foundational problem and under those conditions Iran will be freed to choose another set of conditions he saidIn his speech Trump pledged that his administration would support the United Nations in its goals of pursuing peace but he was sharply critical of the organization and its member nations for not living up to the promise of its founding in 1945We do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures values or systems of government he said But we do expect all nations to uphold their core sovereignty and respect the interests of their own people and rights of every other sovereign nationThis is the beautiful vision of this institution and the foundation for cooperation and successLater in the day at a lunch hosted byUN Secretary General Antnio Guterres Trump said he sees great potential in the United NationsThe potential of the United Nations is unlimited Trump said And I really believe  Ive met your representatives and I know you well  youre going to do things that will be epic and I certainly hope you will But I feel very very confidentThe president in his speech also focused on the growing threats of radical Islamic terrorism a phrase he had left out of other recent speeches including a prime time address to the nation on his Afghanistan strategy He declared that his administration would not allow loser terrorists to tear up our nation or tear up the entire worldBut Trump also cautioned that areas of the world are in conflict and some in fact are going to hell He spent a portion of the speech decrying the disastrous rule of VenezuelasNicols Maduro whose authoritarian regime has sent the country into political and economic crisisIt is completely unacceptable and we cannot stand by and watch Trump said calling on the United Nations to help the Venezuelan people regain their freedom and recover their country and restore their democracyHe did not address some aspects of his foreign policy that have alarmed foreign leaders including the proposed temporary ban on immigration for several Muslim-majority nations a border wall with Mexico or the planned US withdrawal from the Paris climate accordHe appeared to answer international criticism of sweeping new restrictions on refugee resettlement by saying that the United States is helping refugees in other ways Washington can help 10 people displaced in their home regions for the cost of moving one to the United States Trump saidNear the end of his remarks Trump asked rhetorically Are we still patriots Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and take ownership of their futuresThe Trump administration is sending out two competing messages on its policy toward Qatar which reflects the different perspectives of President Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson As Tillerson works behind the scenes to mediate between Americas feuding Persian Gulf allies officials and observers say the presidents more aggressive stance could hinder his aides ability to succeedThe trouble began when  Administration officials confirmed that Tillerson is now trying to arrange a summit in Washington this week between the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates and Qatar Tillerson met Tuesday morning with  at the State Department The UAE would be represented by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani would represent QatarLate Tuesday evening a State Department official said the chances of a summit taking place this week had become less likely as the parties did not yet appear ready to make the moveState Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Wednesday that Tillerson and Jubeir agreed on the need forall parties to come together to resolve their disputes She described the mood as hopeful and said both officials believed the worst of the crisis was behind themInside the administration the  have yet to be resolvedTillerson issued a statement Friday calling for dialogue to end the dispute only to have Trump deliver remarks two hours later demanding Qatar end its financing of terrorAdministration officials said the speeches could be construed as being consistent as both Tillerson and Trump broadly want to resolve the crisis and want Qatar to do more on the issue of terrorism financing But two officials said Trumps statement was added at the last minute did not go through the interagency process and the State Department had no advance notice that Trump was going to take a harsher toneEverybody was taken by surprise by the presidents comments It undermined what the secretary had to say one State Department official said The policy that is being worked is the Tillerson policy Trumps comments notwithstandingTillersons approach has been to attempt to show the White House he can make progress before more coercive steps against Qatar are considered Theres a feeling inside the administration that the White House doesnt really have a plan for Qatar and so the State Department has space to advance its own strategyQatar signed the US-Gulf Cooperation Council  on combating terrorism financing that Trump championed in Riyadh Saudi Arabia last month but the text of that agreement has never been released and its details are unclearThe gap between Trump and Tillerson is troubling to many because it suggests that foreign officials cant necessarily count on what Americas top diplomat says about US policyIf the secretary of state cant speak for the president then he shouldnt be speaking said  senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies They need to agree on a message and a strategy and not talk like they are in isolation boothsTrumps different tone on Qatar also undermines Tillersons efforts because the president has taken a clear side in the dispute a former US diplomat who worked in the region told me As Tillerson begins negotiations the Saudis could believe they have top cover from the White House They see a US president who is giving them carte blanche It definitely makes Tillersons negotiating position weaker the former US diplomat saidThe Trump-Tillerson difference reflects a similar divide in Washington Tillerson who has decades of experience with Qatar represents a large swath of the foreign policy and national security community who believe that Qatar has been a reliable albeit complicated ally supporting US military operations Isolating and punishing Qatar runs counter to the goal ofgetting its leadership to address US concerns their argument goesDefense Secretary Jim Mattis  that Qatar is moving in the right direction when it comes to combating terrorist financing The US ambassador to Qatar Dana Shell Smith has repeatedly defended Qatars efforts since the crisis broke out She  on Twitter TuesdayTrump has very little experience with the Qatari regime But his toughstance has encouraged parts of the national security community who have long advocated a harsher policy At a recent conference held by the  House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif) said that if Qatar doesnt improve  moving US military operations out of  where current coordination for the coalition war against the Islamic Stateis doneShort of moving the base there are other ways lawmakers could turn up the heat on Qatar Royce has  led by Rep Brian Mast (R-Fla) that targets the funding of the Palestinian group Hamas The legislation which is also co-sponsored by Royces Democrat counterpart Rep Eliot Engel (NY) names Qatar several times as a Hamas sponsor and would have the effect of sanctioning Qatar if enactedTillerson has some time to show that the crisis between Qatar and its gulf neighbors can be resolved diplomatically and defend his longtime friends from their detractors around Washington and inside the White House If he fails the US-Qatar relationship could get very rocky very fastInvestigators continued Thursday to probe the 29-year-old Uzbek immigrant charged with the New York truck attack poring over his communications to see if he had any help or guidance before carrying out his deadly rampage whilePresident Trump publicly weighed in on the federal prosecution of the suspectNew York police officials saythe attacker appears to have radicalized himself online and that it doesnotappear anyone else was involved thoughthey said that continues to be a key question in the international investigation launched after theHalloween attack in Lower Manhattan killed eight people and wounded a dozen othersFederal authorities chargedSayfullo Saipov the suspected attacker with providing support to a terrorist organization saying that he was inspired by the Islamic State to carry out the rampage The militant group also known as ISIS has urgedits supporters to use vehicles for attacksIn the charging document filed Wednesday authorities saidSaipov plannedfor a year to carry out an attack in the United States and ultimately chose Halloween because he believed more people would be outside as potential targetsThe federal prosecution against Saipov was just hours old when a potentially complicating factor emerged in the form of  Since the attack Trump haspublicly criticizedthe American criminal justice system and weighed sending Saipov  at Guantanamo BayIn messages posted on Twitter  and early Thursday Trump twice called for Saipov to get the death penalty while also Would love to send the NYC terrorist to Guantanamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the Federal system Trump wrote early Thursday He continued There is also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed Should move fast DEATH PENALTYTrumps comments much like  about Army Sgt Bowe Bergdahl could create a hurdle in the federal case While one of the charges against Saipov  one count of violence and destruction of a motor vehicle  could carry with it a possible death sentence the Justice Department has not yet said whether it will seek that penalty If prosecutors do pursue a rare federal death sentence against Saipov defense attorneys could argue that Trumps tweets may prevent a jury from giving the suspect a fair trialThe remarks from Trump broke from the tradition that presidents and other senior officials refrain from commentingon ongoing cases in ways that could complicate proceedings though he is not the first commander in chief to do so In 2009 then-President Barack Obama  on the case against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed self-proclaimed mastermind of the Sept 11 2001 attacks and suggested he would get the death penalty Obama thenbacktracked and said he did not mean to prejudge the caseSaipov was charged in a criminal complaint though authorities will eventually ask a grand jury to indict him and he could possibly face additional charges His next court appearance is technically scheduled for November 15 though that is very likely to change after an indictment is filedDavid Patton Saipovs attorney declined to comment Thursday on Trumps comments In a statement released before Trump tweeted Patton said In a case like this involving so much tragedy its more important than ever to let the judicial process play out How we as a society treat Mr Saipov will say more about us than it will about himAt a speech Thursday in New York City that was scheduled before the truck attack Attorney General Jeff Sessions highlighted the work federal prosecutors have done bringing cases against terrorism suspects in federal courtHe noted particularly the recent conviction of Ahmad Khan Rahimi who set off bombs in New York and New Jersey last year the recent unsealing of charges against three men who plotted to bomb the New York City subway and Times Square and the apprehension of Mustafa al-Imam a Libyan national charged with participating in the 2012 Benghazi attacksThe remarks in some ways seemed to be a subtle hint to the president that terror suspects can face justice in American courts But Sessions a vocal supporter of using the military prison at Guantanamo Bay also made mention of the facility thereTerrorists should know this Administration will use all lawful tools at our disposal including prosecution in Article III courts and at Guantanamo Bay Sessions said according to a prepared copy of his remarks If anyone has any doubt about that they can ask the more than 500 criminals whom the Department of Justice has convicted of terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 And they can ask the dozens of enemy combatants in Guantanamo BaySessions who attended a roll call Thursday with officers also heaped praise on the New York City Police Department in particular the officer who shot and wounded SaipovThe attorney general has had a strained relationship with New York Citys leaders and in April declared that gang murders there were the predictable consequence of the citys soft on crime stance Sessionss remarks  from New York officials as have some of Trumps commentsBy Thursday afternoon Trump had returned his focus to immigration saying that he was calling for Congress to end a visa lottery program the suspected attacker used to get into the country years earlierTrump in one of his tweets about the New York attack cited one of the most incendiary parts of the  filed against SaipovAuthorities said that Saipov told them he felt good aboutwhat he had done and while speaking to investigators requested to display ISISs flag in his hospital roomIn the criminal complaint the FBI described whatSaipov said in his Manhattan hospital room depicting him as a man who had reams ofIslamic State propaganda on his phones and carefully plotted what he was doingSaipovtold agentshe wanted to kill as many people as he could court papers state and he considered putting Islamic State flags at the front and back of his truck before deciding thatwould draw too much attentionAuthorities said Saipov told them that while he first decided a year ago to carry out an attack in the United States  the country where he moved in 2010 on a diversity visa and became a legal permanent resident  he only decided to use a truck two months beforeSaipov rented one on the week before the attack to practice making turns with it authorities saidAneighbor said he thought it was suspicious thatSaipov wasdriving an apparently empty truck Police say that on Tuesday afternoon Saipov drove a truck onto the bike path along the west side of Manhattan and targetedcyclists and pedestrians as he careened south Among those Saipov is accused of killing were a  now in their late 40s who had been planning a trip to New York for years a young mother and two men in their 20s and 30s from New York and New JerseySaipov told authorities he was particularly inspired by a video capturingIslamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi asking Muslims in the United States what they were doingto respond to the killing of other members of their faith in Iraq the complaint statesOfficials have said that Saipov apparently becameradicalized online after he came to the United States Heappears to have followed almost exactly to a T the instructions that ISIS has put out in its social media channels laying out guidance for carrying out an attack according toJohn Miller the deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism at the New York City Police DepartmentAmong other things officials say Saipov used a rented truck had brought knives and a stun gun as additional weapons and left behind notes declaring his allegiance According to court papers onenote written in Arabic could be translated in part to read Islamic Supplication It will endureAs the Islamic State has suffered battlefield losses and seen its self-declared caliphate shrink  has become the attack of choice for the groups adherents and supporters in other areas The tactic has been used with deadly resultsin France Britain Germany Sweden Spain and CanadaInvestigators are stillexploringwhether anyone else had any knowledge of or aided in the New York plot The FBI said briefly on Wednesday it was seeking another man 32-year-old Mukhammadzoir Kadirov or Muhammad Kadirov  in connection with the investigation The bureau gave no indication why they were seeking him and minutes laterreversed course saying they had found him but providing no further detailsA person who was in touch with both Saipovs and Kadirovs families on Wednesday said that Kadirov is in New Jersey has retained an attorney and is cooperating with law enforcement officials but that he was not under arrest as of Wednesday evening The person who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject said Kadirov is Saipovs cousin and seemed utterly shocked and horrified by what Saipov had doneThe rampage on Tuesday afternoon ended when Saipovcrashed into a school bus and emerged from his truck armed with a paintball gun and pellet gun police said A passer-by flagged down police officers responding to an unrelated call at a school in the area and one of them shot and wounded Saipov police saidAuthorities also said Saipov intended to continue his attack beyond the bike path He told investigators he intended to keep going to the Brooklyn Bridge to kill even more people the complaint states but was apparently unable to after crashing the truckOn Oct 5 the US finished negotiating a complex and controversial free-trade agreement with 11 other countries called the  or TPP Congress is  to vote yes or no on the treaty And one  is especially contentious  or Investor-State Dispute SettlementSome 3000 international  already exist that allow foreign investors to sue the government of a sovereign country legally challenging its actions but outside the countrys own courts Foreign investors have sued at least 120 different countries more than 650 times between 1990 through 2014Ezra Klein at Vox  The ISDS system isnt likely to have much effect on Americans at all Its true that the US has prevailed in the 13 lawsuits brought to judgment against it thus far So is the outcry over ISDS  from Sen  on the left to the  on the right  much ado about nothingNo it isntFirst of all while one putative justification for ISDS is that it encourages investment it isnt at all clear that it does Second it hurts to get sued even if you dont lose Third ISDS doesnt depoliticize investors disputes as it was supposed toHeres what the research says about the  and how it has consequences for the United States tooThe purported justification for ISDS is that its risky for businesses to set up shop in another countrys sovereign territory They might find their property confiscated or their investments undermined by government action However countries can      and thus governments want to reassure potential investors Thats why they   to promise fair treatment to foreign investors ISDS is designed as a failsafe if the government behaves badly the foreign investor can sue and get compensationIf ISDS did help soothe the fears of foreign investors leading them to invest more it might be worth the tradeoffs The problem is that there is no clear evidence that these agreements do attract investors Many scholars have used sophisticated statistical techniques to show in the end that investment treaties     increase in foreign direct investment     For example US firms investing in factories infrastructure and other physical assets  abroad when the US has an investment treaty with the partner country But thats a far cry from ISDS increasing investment everywhereEven if ISDS did work as it was supposed to it wouldnt do much for investment into the United States Investment treaties and ISDS were initially supposed to help very risky developing countries reassure investors that they werent stuck if they got tangled up in the developing nations   legal systems Because the United States has a well-functioning legal system that rationale for ISDS is  hereFor the United States the  of ISDS in the TPP is that American firms get the right to sue other TPP governments Reasonable people can disagree about whether that justifies the downsides of ISDSOne key downside to consider is that the right to sue goes both ways While we know that democracies like the United States interfere with firms property rights   they still   And under the TPP more frustrated investors from more places can sue the US[]The problem is that countries that get sued get less future investment  including less investment from  of the firm doing the suing Just getting sued is enough to scare off other investors It might not matter whether the US wins its lawsuits or notIf it is costly to get sued then rational governments will behave in ways that minimize the risk of getting sued This is the root of the worry about what ISDS might do to regulation The US government might think twice about setting regulations that trigger lawsuitsFor instance what if TransCanada uses the NAFTA ISDS provision to sue the United States for unfair treatment over the Keystone Pipeline The international law  is buzzing that such a lawsuit could be filed even though TransCanada probably wouldnt win But being sued might be bad enough to discourage the US from making other controversial regulatory decisionsThis said in new research we find that ISDS might be good at getting investment from at least one source  from the aggrieved investor itself Well over one-third of investors reinvest after they win a lawsuit and a quarter of investors reinvest even after they lose a lawsuitsuggesting that some investors may respect the rule of law even if they dont like the outcomeHistorically ISDS was supposed to  investment At the    governments sue each other So firms with trade disputes have to complain to their diplomats firstISDS was supposed to keep diplomats from getting pulled into private investment disputes because firms file their own lawsuits instead That hasnt happened In fact I  about how diplomats and national origins shape investors political risks today ISDS made it easier for me to do my research because disputes that used to be hidden behind closed doors are now heard in public international tribunalsInvestors want their home governments to remain involved in their disputes abroad for good reason These disputes can get politically tricky Countries in general  what they were in for when ISDS  around the world in the last decades Getting sued can be a real  Lawsuits have been centerpieces of political campaigns in countries like     and so on Some disillusioned governments have   or withdrawn from treaties In short ISDS can stir up anger that diplomats have to quellA large body of research suggests real consequences to a system that for better or worse has become part and parcel of modern trade treaties ISDS seems obscure but it is already shaping the behavior of American actors And the TPP doubles-down on itWhen Mahmoud Ahmadinejad put hishat into Irans presidential ring a couple of weeks ago onlookers literally gaspedThe hard-liner had of course already run the countryfor eight years as an isolationist with a talent for riling the West His flawed reelection in 2009 sparked the GreenMovement which brought thousands of protesters into the streets In the ensuing government crackdown hundreds of people were arrested The government said at least 27 were killed but rights groups put the death toll higherIt was such a fraught time and Ahmadinejad was so contentious that the countrys supreme leader urged him to stay out of politics I told him he should not participate in that matter Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said last year according to his official website Its not in his interest and that of the country (Other former presidents have received similar adviceThe media is banned from using the name or image of Mohammad Khatami a reformist who led the country between 1997 and 2005 Former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was barred from seeking another term in 2013 Irans first post-revolutionary president Abol Hassan Bani-Sadr lives in exile in France)When asked by reporters Ahmadinejad brushed off the ayatollahs words as advice not instruction He has been campaigning around the country and even joined Twitter  Turns out he was wrongThis week the countrys Guardian Council announced thecandidates for president in the May 19 election About 1600 men and women had applied to run the final list includes six names As was widely expected incumbent Hassan Rouhani will seek reelection Other contenders include Ebrahim Raisi a

name was nowhere to be seenOn social media Ali Akbar Javanfekr an Ahmadinejad ally tried to downplay the decision writing that Ahmadinejad registered to run only out of national religious and revolutionary duty Referring to Ahmadinejad and his former vice president who was also turned downThank god the Guardian Council removed the duty from their shouldersOthers didnt take it as wellDisqualifying candidates is illegal If Ahmadinejad has committed a crime why hasnt been put on trial all these years tweeted Iranian user @sahartwitt We are opposed to the disqualifications of the Guardian Council its not right for the council to decide what the people are meant to decideThat anger may be just what Ahmadinejad intended Like supporters of populists around the world his base is already suspicious of the political establishment The supreme leaders decision riled Ahmadinejads base and burnished his image as an opponent of the establishment  Experts say the presidential election is likely to be a tight three-way contest between the conservatives Raisi and Ghalibaf along with Rouhani Raisi in particular is a prominent Shiite cleric who is being touted as a possible successor to the supreme leader (Jahangiri has already said that he will drop out of the race eventually  that he is only running to defendRouhanis accomplishments when he appears in television commercials and in debates)Raisi and Ghalibaf belong to the same conservative coalition If they both stay in the race they may split the conservative vote and assure Rouhanis victory particularly if the incumbents moderate-reformist coalition holds Thats a big if of course especially in IranTheres a prolonged pause when I ask Lyft driver Gaby Oseguedaif her family is middle class Her smile fades as she thinks about it for a whileYeah I think so I dont even know what the middle class is anymore says Osegueda who with her husband earns nearly $100000 a year in the San Francisco areaThe majority of Americans  62 percent  identify as middle class according to aconducted in June Its the highest percentage of people feelingthat way since 2003 But a lotofAmericansare like Osegueda Theyfeel middle class but they arent sure what it meansJust who exactly is middle class is in the national spotlight again as President Trump and Republicans in Congress craft tax cuts for individuals and corporations that they say will primarily benefit the middle Vice President Pence calledthe plan which is a middle class miracle this week Butamid this discussion the middle class has been defined in different waysGary Cohn Trumps top economic adviser recently discussed how a typical family making $100000 a year would benefit Trump has espoused the value of the plan to truckers who make around $41000 a yearSo what is the middle class In America an income ofin the middle according to the US CensusBut its not that simple  There is no exact definition of middle class and a deep look at the data shows a wide variety of individuals could be part of it depending on where they live and how big their family is The middle class inSan Francisco where Osegueda livesis not the same as it is in Peoria Ill You can explore whether your household is middle class in this calculator (more details on our definition below)Osegueda and her husband are in their early 30sBoth have college degrees  she also has a masters  and launched careers in San Franciscos booming tech industry She worked in human resources and hes an engineer They love San Francisco but a year ago they moved to Pacifica a suburbwhere rent is more affordable and their young son has space to play Despite making nearly $100000 a year they arent sure theyll ever own a home at least not anywhere in the Bay AreaIts not just San FranciscoA quick glance at the median income in these six American cities highlights how muchit varies Newton Mass$122100 Washington DC$70800 Denver $53600 Dallas$43800 Birmingham Ala$31200 Flint Mich $24900Now take a look at how median income varies by family size The median income for single people in America is just $30400 For a household of two it jumps to $65600 For three its nearly $77000 For four its $91000 (not far from Cohns definition of $100000 for a family of four) You get the idea The more people in a family the more money they typically need to live a comfortable middle-class lifestyleWhen Americans talk about the middle class they are usually thinking about a range not just the specific income dead in the middle Pew Research says the middle class runs from (before tax) They define middle as a household of three with an income that falls between two-thirds and double the median income By Pews calculation just over half of American households are truly middle class less than the 62 percent who self-identify that way  To dig further into the data The Washington Post opted to define middle class as American households with incomes that fall between the 30th percentile mark and the 80th percentile mark It captures half of US householdsbut the range is skewed high enough so that someone would have to be well above the poverty line and earn at least $16 an hour in a full-time job to qualifyAmericas middle-class ranges from $35000 to $122500in annual income according to The Posts calculation (The data is in 2016 dollars before taxes You can see in the chart below how much the range varies by household size) Rakesh Kochhar associate director of research at Pew calls it a fair estimate He helped craft Pews definitionThe bottom line is $100000 is on the middle-class spectrum but barely 75 percent of US householdsmake less than thatOthers prefer to define middle class by the lifestyle you can afford They think of middle class status symbols such as being able to own a home and car and go on a family vacation now and then to places like Disney World or the beachFormer vice president Joe Biden headed up a Middle Class Task Force which put out aclassifying middle class like this Middle-class families are defined by their aspirations more than their income [they] aspire to homeownership a car college education for their children health and retirement security and occasional family vacationsIn Beattyville Ky a place dubbed  median income is only $16000 and a typical home costs only $53000 Deep poverty also existson many Indian reservations such as the one in Blackwater Ariz where the median income is just $18000On the other end of the spectrum are rapidlydeveloping cities such as the San Francisco area where Osegueda lives The median income is a whopping $136000 in Palo Alto the hub of Silicon Valley Even engineers at Facebook have been  their rentBeing able to save for a home seems even more of an implausible scenarioMy husband and I sometimes look at each other and say what are we doing here A house here costs a million dollars says Osegueda Its kind of insane when you think about it  Osegueda and her husband once lived in the trendy Mission Districtof San Francisco but they moved out of the city when apartments on their block started renting for $4000 a month for a one-bedroom Osegueda has been staying home to take care of her 1-year-old son but she drives a few days a week for ride-share service Lyft to help the family budget and mingle with people in the city she lovesAmericas vast differences in pay and costs make creating a one-size-fits-all tax policy tricky One of the biggest dilemmas Republicans face as they work on the tax bill is where to draw the tax bracket lines for people of different incomes GOP leaders are still working out where to set the rates and at what income level those rates will kick inIts even more complicated when you consider race and educational attainment Eighty-five percent of African Americans and 82 percent of Hispanics make less than $100000 according to US census data And 85 percent of people with only a high school education a group Trump won handily in the election make under that thresholdAnotherbig debate right now is whether to get rid of the state and local tax deduction (known as SALT) This allows people to deduct their state and local taxes from their federal income taxes abenefit thats particularly lucrative for people in high-tax cities and statessuch as San Francisco It could make a substantial difference to some middle-class familiesRepublicans arent the only ones who have had a dicey time defining middle class In the 2008 Democratic primary Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama famously sparred over this question They ended up  as the maximum threshold Once Obama won the nomination he campaigned on a promise not to raise any form of taxes on individuals making less than $200000 and couples making $250000 or less Clinton resurrected that pledge in the 2016 campaign taking heat from progressives for pandering toPoliticiansalmost always say their top concern is the well-being of the middle classtaking advantage of the vague definitions of the term to appeal to votersat a broad range of income levelsButas Republicans look to rewrite the tax code their proposal to sharply cut tax rates while also eliminating many tax deductionswillhave winners and losers including among people who consider themselves middle classThe NFL has been blamed for many things this season The latest controversy involves Papa Johns a league sponsor  Wednesday for its poor third quarter sales growth Papa Johns stock was downabout 12percent in trading Wednesday and CEO John Schnatter said NFL leadership has hurt Papa Johns shareholders This should have been nipped in the bud a year and a half ago sees Schnatters claim as a stretch Pizza Huts CEO added that  on the anthem demonstrations affecting business while the sales at Dominos rose 84 percent during the third quarter But Schnatters comments during the companys quarterly earnings call has sparked a divisive question Is Papa Johns even goodThe question hasled many on social media to debate whether the product itself is the reason Papa Johns has struggled of late So we asked 15 Redskins players to name their three favorite pizza chains As youd expect there wasnt a consensusThirteen pizza chains were named in this anonymous poll so we tallied them up with first place votes receiving three points second place counting for two points and third place as one point Here are the results with the amount of first-place votes in parenthesesPizza Hut  19 (4)Dominos  19 (2)Papa Johns  18 (4)Little Caesars  7&pizza  6 (2)Blaze Pizza  4Imos Pizza  3 (1)Paisanos Pizza  3 (1)Mellow Mushroom  3 (1)Cicis Pizza  3Chuck E Cheeses  3Godfathers Pizza  1(Note One player did not give a third place vote Another initially said Sweet Melissas Pizza was his favorite but Ive never heard of it It doesnt count)The results of this scientific study show Papa Johns and Pizza Hut tied for the most first place votes with four but seven players did not have Papa Johns in their top three Ten players had Dominos in their top three giving it a one-point edge over Papa Johns despite just two first-place votes Most were aware of thecommentsSchnatter made regarding the NFL One did not know and changed his vote when he found out removing Papa Johns from his top three altogether  Papa Johns also received two second-place votes and two third-place votes Dominos had five second-place votes and two third-place votes Pizza Hut finished with two second-place votes and three third-place votesFive players voted for Little Caesars including two who ranked it secondThat $5 Hot-N-Ready can hit the spot sometimes one player said Another player appeared grossed out by the thought of eating a Hot-N-Ready pizza when you dont know how long its been sitting thereAthletes theyre just like us&pizza a chain that allows you to build-your-own personal rectangular pizza received two first-place votes Its not a pizza chain in the traditional sense but it is located in four states and the District of Columbia It counts The same goes for Blaze Pizza which got two second-place votesPaisanos which received a first-place vote has more than 30 locations in the DC area and oddly enough will soon expand to Orlando and Dubai according toitswebsite Pasianos also has  featuring current Redskins Ryan Kerrigan and Terrelle Pryor Sr and former Redskins Santana Moss Brian Mitchell and Ken HarveyImos a popular St Louis chain with locations in Illinois and Kansas received a first-place vote Mellow Mushroom based in Atlanta with more than 150 locations also received a first-place vote Cicis Pizza a popular buffet and takeout chain and Chuck E Cheese each received a second and third place voteAs with most things players differ on where exactly Papa Johns ranks among pizza chains It isnt the clear-cut favorite But its not hated eitherIn March 2017 President Trump for relying on sketchy media reports to claim that former president Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower his 2016 campaign headquarters Then on Sept 19 CNN reported that the US government wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort Trumps supporters  (trended on Twitter) and several readers asked us to revisit our Four Pinocchio ratingWhat do we know about the wiretapping of Manafort Did the CNN report vindicate Trump of his Four-Pinocchio claimFirst lets briefly revisit the White Houses explanations for Trumps March 2017 tweets (Read  for more) Officialsprovided five articles and only one reported that a foreign intelligence surveillance (FISA) court order was granted in October to examine possible activity between two Russian banks and a computer server in the Trump TowerThe report did not say that Obama requested the order nor that it resulted in the tapping of Trumps phone lines in Trump TowerFurther then-White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer appeared to couch Trumps claim He said Trump used quotation marks around wires tapped to refer to surveillance in a general senseI think theres no question that the Obama administration that there were actions about surveillance and other activities that occurred in the 2016 election  The president used the word wiretaps in quotes to mean broadly surveillance and other activitiesAt the time several lawmakers from both parties  saying they were not aware of any evidence supporting his claimJames Clapper the director of national intelligence under Obama said in an interview on NBCs Meet the Press following Trumps tweets that he would have known about a FISA court order on something like this Absolutely I can deny itThen-FBI Director James Comey said in a congressional testimony after Trumps tweets that neither his agency nor the Justice Department had evidence to support the presidents allegations  in early September 2017 Trumps own Justice Department and the FBI again said they did not have evidence to support Trumps claimsNow lets look at theCNN reported that there was a FISA court order for surveillance of Manafort relating to the FBIs investigation of him over potential ties to Ukrainian politics The FBI investigation began in 2014 sources told CNN This surveillance was extended at least into early 2017 possibly to include an investigation into Manaforts role in the Trump campaignSome of the intelligence collected includes communications that sparked concerns among investigators that Manafort had encouraged the Russians to help with the campaign according to three sources familiar with the investigation Two of these sources however cautioned that the evidence is not conclusive CNN reportedTheres no evidence that this means Manaforts residence in Trump Tower was wiretapped He also has a home in Alexandria Va which the FBI raided this summerAn important note In order to obtain FISA authority to conduct surveillance inside the United States an FBI agent would need to prove the case to a federal judge It requires the approval and review of the courts  not the president or the White House (Our colleague Ellen Nakashima explained this )After the CNN report Comey stood by his testimony His attorney David N Kelley  I dont believe Jim is aware of any information that would cause him to second guess or change his testimonyFurther as we noted earlier Trumps own Justice Department said in early September 2017 in a court filing that they do not have evidence that supports his March 2017 tweetsWhile the CNN report does not support Trumps tweets it does raise the question of whether something Trump said was picked up as a part of the governments surveillance on ManafortClapper said it is  that something Trump said during a conversation with Manafort was picked up by intelligence officials But he said he was unaware of a FISA warrant on ManafortHowever the Wall Street Journal  that Manafort was placed under surveillance after he left the Trump campaign in the summer 2016 and that the surveillance did not involve listening to Manaforts phone conversations in real-time So that means Trumps conversation would not have gotten picked up by any investigator real-timeBut even if there was real-time phone surveillance and Trump happened to be talking to Manafort thatstillwould not support Trumps claims from March that Obama ordered a wiretapping of then-presidential candidate Trumps phone in Trump TowerThere is no new detail in the Sept 19 CNN report that warrants a change to our original Four-Pinocchio rating Trump had claimed that Obama ordered the wiretapping of his phones in Trump Tower just before the presidential election That allegation remainsunprovenPerhaps it was a Trumpian inarticulate way of claiming that he learnedin March 2017 that the US government had wiretapped his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and that it may have been in Manaforts residence in Trump TowerBut thats questionable since the White House so thoroughly failed at providing any proof to back up Trumps claim at the timeThe new CNN report does raise questions as to whether a conversation involving Trump was picked up as a part of the wiretapping of Manafort  but thats not the issue that Trump originally raisedWe stand by our original fact check and reaffirm our Four-Pinocchio rulingWe will continue to watch for any other developments and update this fact check as necessary()Do you rate this claim as

sharp rebuke from Clintons campaignWell I just dont think she has a presidential look Trump told Muir And you need a presidential look You have to get the job done I think if she went to Mexico she would have had a total failure We had a big successAs The Washington Posts  at the timeTrump has said regularly on the campaign trail that Clinton does not look presidential which his critics have blasted as a sexist attack on the first female presidential nominee for a major political partyWhen Muir pressed Trump on whether his comments were about her physical aesthetic Trump shrugged  suggesting his disapproval with the question  before knocking Clinton for her attacks on himWithin hours Clintons campaign was working to raise money off Trumps commentsLuckily for all of us a presidential campaign isnt one of Trumps beauty pageants a Clinton aide said in an online fundraising solicitation His judgment counts for very little on most things and even less when the subject is who looks presidentialAs Clare Malone said on the Five Thirty Eight post titled This election particularly on the Republican side has been a lot more upfront about sexism gender and yes masculinity (see aforementioned penis) Some of that has to do with Republicans spinning the race to talk about popular American culture being out of touch with traditional American life  the kind of life/lifestyle they think most Republican voters want Thats a new spin on the culture wars but its also given the GOP candidates ways to talk about being manly men and to have that characterization make them stand in opposition to what they might see as an increasingly effeminate culture  talking about sexism homophobia etc in our everyday livesIn August Jennifer Jones a PhD candidate in the department of political science at the University of California at Irvine how Clintons speechhas become more masculine in the past two decades of her political career  It compared feminine and masculine words Clinton used in public statements in 1996 and 2014In 1996 Clinton said I eight times and we only once indicating a more personal feminine style In 2014 however Clinton did not say I even once but said we or our three timesHer 2014 response is less tentative and self-conscious but more complex and distant  all markers of masculine languageMore than two daysafter authorities said a man with apparent allegiance to the Islamic State  killing eight and injuring a dozen others the militant group declared that the attacker was a soldier of the caliphateThis claim of responsibility late Thursday fell short of asserting that the Islamic State had coordinated or directed the attack but instead suggested thatthe rampage was inspired by the militant group Law enforcement officials in the United States had previously said as much publicly saying the suspect appeared to be guided by Islamic State propagandaFederal authorities chargedSayfullo Saipov a 29-year-old Uzbek immigrant with carrying out the attack Tuesday saying thatit appearshe was radicalized online sometime after coming to the United States in 2010 They say he  and he could potentially face the death

soldiers will follow only after media reports emerge publicly showing that suspect or suspects had declared allegiance to the group which is also known as ISISThe Islamic States claim appeared to have resonated with President Trump who paused a largely focused on domestic politics toannounce that the military had increasedaction against the groupISIS just claimed the Degenerate Animal who killed and so badly wounded the wonderful people on the West Side was their soldier Based on that the Military has hit ISIS much harder over the last two days They will pay a big price for every attack on

respectively Separately the Pentagon announced Friday that US airstrikes had killed an unspecified number of Islamic State militants in SomaliaAfter the truck attack in New York authorities quickly turned to terrorism as a motive and said the driver had written notes referencing the Islamic StateIn the criminal complaint filed in federal court the FBI said Saipov had reams of Islamic State propaganda on his cellphones Saipov toldauthorities he was particularly inspired by a videoof Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi asking Muslims in the United States what they were doing to

backwards through friends associates phone records Internet contactsJohn Miller the deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism at the New York City Police Department said at a briefingAuthorities said the New York suspect appeared to have closely hewed to the Islamic States guidance for carrying out such attacks Saipov appears to have followed almost exactly to a T the

used to assert responsibility for attacks but was offered inal-Naba the groups weekly newspaper according to SITE Intelligence Group which monitors extremist activityThe group has claimed credit in

rampage last month although American authorities quickly dismissed thatTrump delivered a much-anticipated speech in Tokyo that the Japanese government hopes will make waves But it was not President Trump who is arriving here Sunday it was IvankaThe first daughter and adviser to the president addressed the Japanese governments  Friday a double-whammy win for Prime Minister Shinzo AbeFirst he gets a high-profile speaker for one of his key initiatives  and one that has failed to bear any other fruit increasing womens participation in the Japanese workforce or in Japanese government parlance an initiative letting women shineSecond Abe can curry more favor with Donald Trump just two days before he arrives in Tokyo on his first trip to Japan as president The visit will include golf at a country club and a banquet but no headline speech That job will fall instead to his daughterIvanka Trump gave a special speech on female entrepreneurship and womens participation in the economy similar to those she made during a womens forum hosted by Angela Merkel in Germany earlier this yearI deeply respect and honor women who choose to work inside the home full time to care for their families she said in an 18-minute speech at the forum with Abe sitting on the stage beside her We never want to discourage that incredible calling but we must also ensure that every woman has the freedom to work outside the home if they so chooseBut despite all the hype the hall where Trump spoke was barely half full A White House official said the speech was the most registered event of the conference but security delayed people from getting into the room in time A Washington Post reporter saw about eight people stuck behind the security cordon as the speech beganThe Japanese government added a day to whats usually a two-day conference scheduling her speech on a public holiday because she couldnt make it earlier But Abe who introduced her to the audience wanted them to hear from Trump described by one of his top aides this week as one of the most remarkable people in the world because she is actively trying to support women entrepreneurs and improve womens participation in society Trump praised Abes efforts to promote womens participation in the workforce in Japan She said the United States and Japan must do more to make it easier for women to balance career and family and to create environments where women feel welcome and valuedAll too often our workplace culture fails to treat women with appropriate respect This takes many forms including harassment which can never be tolerated she said indirectly referring to the explosion of sexual harassment allegations in the United States since reports emerged of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinsteins actionsShe will have dinner with Abe and his wife Friday night leaving Japan before her father arrives   Japan has something of a fascination with Ivanka Trump who is viewed here by some as the perfect woman She has a career and a beautiful family and blond hair and always looks immaculateMany people think shes like a princess said Lully Miura a political scientist at the University of Tokyo Shes well educated beautiful sophisticated and rich And its very surprising to Japanese women that she can also talk about things that are important to societyAt least four television channels broadcast a live shot of an empty escalator Thursday afternoon awaiting her arrival at the airport interspersed with her tweets and Instagram photosTV commentators noted approvingly that she says she spends 20 minutes each morning meditating and only eight minutes putting on her makeup  balancing her luxury celebrity lifestyle with being a mother of three children At least one channel had a cardboard cutout of Ivanka on setThe Tokyo metropolitan police have reportedly formed a women-only riot police unit to protect Trump during her visit although they will be dressed in suits to blend inLikewise Japanese companies that import her clothing label say theyve had a surge in salesInquiries and orders for the brand increased dramatically from January and during the busiest period more than 10 customers contacted us each day because they heard about Ivanka said Tamana Kawanishi manager of Chez Ibiza a clothing shop in Tokyo We received zero inquires before the electionAn online store Waja was selling about six Ivanka Trump brand items of clothing a month before her father was elected president This year it has averaged about 600 a monthI think people who saw the news about Ivankas visit to Japan are checking our website and buying said Yukie Suzuki a Waja spokeswoman  While the 36-year-olds arrival in Japan has generated the kind of coverage usually reserved for celebrities Ivanka Trump and her message at the prime ministers conference do little to advance the cause of the average Japanese woman analysts sayIve long been cynical about his efforts to promote women said Chelsea Szendi Schieder an expert on gender in Japan who teaches at Meiji University in Tokyo Abes initiative dubbed womenomics seems like a branding effort that promotes a few elite women rather than a serious effort to reduce the wage gap or poverty experienced by single mothers she saidAbe has championed increasing womens participation in the workforce as a way to pull Japan out of its decades of economic malaiseBut his efforts have resulted in little tangible progressUnderlining this Japan has slipped further in the  Japan now comes in 114th out of 144 countries regarding gender equality making it by far the worst in the Group of Seven industrial nations Japan stood at 101st in 2012 the year Abe returned to officeThe decline in womens political empowerment largely because of a reduction in the number of women in parliament and in senior political positions drove this years deterioration according to the report published ThursdayOnly two of the 24 ministers in Abes cabinet and less than 10percent of members of parliament are womenWhile more women are working they are overrepresented in part-time or casual jobs that do not come with the security or benefits of regular jobs Seventy percent of part-time workers are women according to the latest statistics from the Japan Institute for Labor Policy and TrainingFurthermore there is strong pressure on women to quit their jobs once they have babies a phenomenon so prevalent that it has its own name mata-hara short for maternity harassment Almost half of working women quit their jobs after having a baby according to the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research  Much of the problem stems from an inflexible work culture that demands long hours at the office and mandatory attendance at after-work social eventsThe two highest-profile cases of death by overwork in Japan have both involved young women one an advertising agency worker who killed herself and the other a TV reporter who had a heart attack at 31 But it is also because of a tax structure that provides no incentive for people in a marriage to work and a lack of child-care facilitiesBut Miura of the University of Tokyo commended the right-leaning Abes efforts to at least try to change the entrenched gender imbalances in Japanese societyA conservative country like Japan wont change without conservative leadership she said The Abe administration is going in the right direction but they need to help the ordinary Japanese woman rather than just promoting these successful elites Yuki Oda contributed to this reportPrime Minister Shinzo Abe secured a crucial victory in Japans parliamentary elections on Sunday with his ruling bloc maintaining a supermajority that could allow it to push for a revision of the nations pacifist constitution With results still trickling in Monday public broadcaster NHK reported that Abes Liberal Democratic Party and its smaller coalition partner Komeito had received at least 312 seats in the 465-seat House of Representatives The result further illustrates the political savvy of Abe 63 who has proved an enduring force in Japanese politics despitescandals and fluctuating approval ratingsThis is a win for Abe said Sheila Smith a Japan expert at the Council on Foreign Relations adding that the supermajority showed a real endorsement of Abes leadership  The decisive victory is expected to bolster Abes hopes in an upcoming leadership contest within his party potentially cementing the prime ministers place in history If Abe serves out a complete four-year term he will remain at the helm during the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games and become Japans longest-servingprime ministerHowever any attempt to amend Japans postwar constitution may end up being Abes most controversial legacy With Sundays vote Abe and his allies have retained the two-thirds majorities in both houses of parliament that are required to call for constitutional amendmentsAbe has long sought to revise Article 9 which renounces war and remove the ambiguity surrounding Japans military known as the Self-Defense ForcesWhile many conservatives view the amendment as overdue many voters remain skeptical South Korea and China Japans neighbors also are nervous about what they see as the potential return of a militaristic JapanIn an interview with NHK after polls closed Abe said he would push for an amendmentThe ruling parties have been granted a majority he said I think it was the peoples voice telling us to make progress in politics and bring results with a stable political baseFor a leader touting stability the election had been a gamble Abe had called the vote more than a year early justifying itby saying that he needed a new mandate to deal with the threat posed by North Korea and to work through the details of a consumption-tax increaseMany analysts saidAbes motive wasmore opportunistic however with the prime minister taking advantage of the disarray of the Democratic Party Japans main opposition party and a small bump in his approval ratings after a number of scandals earlier this yearFor a while it didnt look as if the bet would pay off After the vote was announced Tokyo Gov Yuriko Koike a staunchly conservative former LDP member foundedher own party whichsoon attracted many members from theDemocrats Some including Koike herself compared her mercurial rise to that of Frances Emmanuel Macron this year Unlike Macron Koikes challenge did not live up to the hype The governoropted against running in the election  and then left for a scheduled business trip to France on election day Koikes Party of Hope was in third place with 49 seats on Monday morning as another new party  the anti-amendment Constitutional Democratic Party  placed second with 54 Speaking to reporters in Paris Koike said she was disappointedIts a very harsh result My remarks and behavior made people feel unpleasant and that led to the harsh result Koike said according to Kyodo News I reflect on this and feel I might have been arrogantIn contrast with recent elections in the United States and Europe relatively few divisive issues were on display in Japan ahead of the vote This plus the relative good health of theeconomy led Daniel Sneider of Stanford University to callthe vote a  an election about nothingThe LDP has long dominated postwar Japanese politics For many Japanese voters Abes leadership represents stability after years of short-lived governments before he returned to the prime ministers office in 2012Some analysts suggest however that the weakness of the opposition may mask discontent with Abe and a lack of support for many of his policies One exit poll cited by Kyodo showed 51percent of voters saying they dont trust Abe while 441percent said they doKoichi Nakano a professor of political science at Sophia University said that the election exposed a lack of widespread support for Abes policies Abe did not win because people enthusiastically support him Nakano said People are disaffected and the opposition is divided The bad weather may have also helped Abe The approaching Typhoon Lan left voters battling strong winds and heavy rain to make it to polling stations On Monday Kyodo estimated the final turnout at 5369 percent only marginally above a record low in the 2014 election That turnout wasremarkable given the weather said Tobias Harrisapolitical analyst with Teneo Intelligence but it wasultimately not good enough to give much of a boost to opposition candidates in close races The typhoon delayed final results with 12 municipalities postponing vote counts until Monday Despite the rain a number of voters could be found exiting a polling station in Tokyos cosmopolitan Roppongi neighborhood Sunday morning Nobue Koizumi a 67-year-old retired translator said she had felt compelled to vote because of fears about Abes security policiesHe uses the North Korea issue as his strategy just to win this election said Koizumi who voted for the Constitutional Democratic PartyBut others said they were voting to back the status quoI dont particularly support Abe but I do support the LDP said Hiroki Shinohara a 54-year-old wholesaler at the Tsukiji fish market I feel its doing whats right for Japan and Japan needs it Yuki Oda contributed to this reportJapans prime minister a man who promised voters he would turn Japan back into a beautiful country is now doing his utmost to Make America Great AgainShinzo Abe is set to arrive in Washington on Friday for his first official summit with President Trump and he will arrive armed with proposals on how Japanese companies will create hundreds of thousands of jobs and invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the United StatesAbe is clearly trying to get on the businessman presidents good side but he will try to do so while also correcting Trumps misunderstandings about Japans trading practices Trump has said that Japan and China engage in practices that are not fair to US companies particularly US automakersI will object where I should object Abe said in the parliament last week when asked about Trumps remarks Id like to clearly explain that its not that one side is benefiting but that both sides are benefiting Its a win-win situationAbe has wasted no time in currying favor with Trump becoming the first foreign leader to meet with him after his election when Abe visited Trump Tower in Manhattan the week after Trumps victory He had been trying to see Trump within a week of his inauguration too but British Prime Minister Theresa May beat him to hold the first summitAbe seems to be playing this as smart as he can said Brad Glosserman a Japan expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies Pacific Forum in Hawaii Its important for him to build a rapport with Trump  Trump likes strong nationalist leaders and Abe is a strong nationalist leader  and personalize the institutionalized relationshipJapan is nervous about its post-World War II security alliance with the United States  Trump had called it into question  but also about economic relations The United States and Japan the worlds largest and third-largest economies were the two linchpins of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal which Trump scrapped immediately upon taking office  Abe will take a plan called the Japan-US growth and employment initiative with him to Washington laying out five fields for economic cooperation including infrastructure robots and artificial intelligence and working together in areas such as the Internet and spaceWith a proposed $450billion in infrastructure investments in the United States Japan would generate 700000 jobs the paper claims according to reports in the Japanese media The prime ministers office declined to confirm themBut it is not clear how many of the jobs Abe will offer will actually be new jobsThe infrastructure component would include high-speed rail projects in the Northeast as well as in Texas and California Japan would also help replace as many as 3000 train and subway cars in the United States the document saidBut Japan is already trying to sell Maryland a  and is involved in bullet train projects in Texas and CaliforniaThe document said Japan would further cooperate in highly efficient gas-fired power generation and the latest compact nuclear-power generation systems according to the Yomiuri Shimbun a conservative newspaper with close ties to the prime minister   Abe met with Akio Toyoda the chief executive of Toyota Motor last week to prepare for the summit according to local reportsAfter Trump took to Twitter to criticize Toyotas plan to build a plant in Mexico to manufacture Corollas for the US market Toyota re-announced plans to invest $600million and add 400 jobs to its plant in Indiana the home state of Vice President PenceSeparately Japans Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) the worlds largest with $12trillion in assets is preparing to invest $150billion in the United States It will buy debt issued by US companies the Nikkei business newspaper reportedThe GPIF had long concentrated its investments in Japanese government bonds but under Abes orders has been buying up Japanese stocks over the past three yearsNorihiro Takahashi president of the fund denied that the latest plan had been orchestrated by Abes government saying investments were made according to the returns they could earn   Polls have shown that most Japanese expect relations with the United States to worsen under Trump One conducted by the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper the day after the inauguration found that 56percent thought it would worsen while 29percent thought it would remain the sameRemarks like those Trump made to pharmaceutical executives last week are fueling concerns about relations with the United States under its new presidentYou look at what Chinas doing you look at what Japan has done over the years Trump told the meeting They play the money market they play the devaluation market and we sit there like a bunch of dummiesFinancial and governmental authorities in Japan immediately responded that their efforts have been aimed at pulling Japan out of two decades of deflation not artificially devaluing the yenJapans prime minister declared Thursday that his country would never become entangled in a war being fought by the United States as his cabinet approved legislation to loosen restrictions on Japans self-defense forcesEven as he vowed that the changes would make technically pacifist Japan more peaceful Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also insisted that the changes would strengthen the countrys military alliance with the United StatesI want to make clear that Japan will never become entangled in a war being fought by the United States Abe said at a news conference after the cabinet approved revisions to 10 security-related lawsWeve been tying to strengthen the Japan-US alliance which is the center of our countrys security The ties between Japan and the US are much stronger than ever due to my recent visit to the US Abe said referring to The revisions which will be submitted Friday to the nations parliament the Diet would allow Japans self-defense forces to aid the United States if it came under attack A strong debate is expected when deliberations begin later this monthUnder the American-written constitution imposed on the country after World War II Japan has not been permitted to maintain a military and can act to defend itself only under a direct attack The changes would give Japan a right of collective self-defense when it is placed in apparent danger as a result of an attack on the United States Japans closest allyThe second main change would allow Japans self-defense forces to be deployed overseas to support another army in combat such as in Iraq or Afghanistan although the government would still need the Diets approval every time before sending such forces abroadThe cabinet began reinterpreting the constitution to allow the changes almost a year ago but this weeks moves set the process in motion The changes are highly controversial in Japan where a majority of the population remains committed to a pacifist constitution The revisions are considered a first step by Abe to try to amend the war-renouncing constitution if his ruling Liberal Democratic Party takes control of the upper chamber in elections next yearHundreds of people gathered outside the prime ministers office Thursday to protest the changes shouting Absolutely opposed to war bills and Dont allow unilateral cabinet approvalOne protester Noriko Yoshino a 58-year-old former teacher from Tokyo said The governments words sound like a deception because they call laws for war as peace support measures Recent polls have found that about half of respondents either do not understand the legislative changes or oppose themIn Washington State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke said the legislation was a domestic matter for Japan but we certainly welcome Japans ongoing efforts to strengthen the alliance and to play a more active role in regional and international security activities The changes are also highly controversial in South Korea and China where critics fear they are part of a broader attempt by Abe accused of being a revisionist and insufficiently repentant for Japans wartime aggression to return the country to a more militaristic footingWe hope that Japan can earnestly learn the lessons of history uphold the path of peaceful development  and play a constructive role in this Asian region Hua Chunying spokeswoman for Chinas foreign ministry told reporters in Beijing according to ReutersIn Seoul South Korean foreign ministry spokesman Noh Kwang-il

encouraged its candidates many of them incumbents to apply to run under the Hope banner Unhappy with the Hope Partys requirements that they support its center-right platform on national security and constitutional revision a group of Democratic Party incumbents then decided to  the  of JapanJapans media has given these new players a lot of attention over the past two weeks But it looks as though it will be business as usual in Sundays election which means that once again Japans LDP will win a large majority and form the next governmentFrom the perspective of my  this combination of drama during the campaign but little actual change in outcome is all rather predictable Japans electoral system makes it easy to form new parties but difficult to make those parties united enough centrist enough and large enough to unseat the LDPIn Japans  some candidates run in districts and are elected via plurality rule while others are placed on party lists with voters asked to choose among party lists Unlike the mixed-member systems in Germany and New Zealand the seats a party wins in Japans single-member district (SMD) and proportional-representation (PR) tiers are added together after the election to make up each partys seat total in the 465-seat House of Representatives   suggest that the need to place first in an SMD will give rise to only two serious candidates  but the lower barrier to gaining seats through the PR tier will give rise to more than two parties And the two candidates vying for first place in a district will tend to converge on a centrist ideological position When there are more than two parties vying for a smaller fraction of the vote on the other hand they will not convergeinsteadspreading out across the ideological spectrumThis leads us to expect that Japans party system will be characterized by two majority-seeking parties which capture seats in both tiers plus a raft of smaller parties that capture the bulk of their seats in proportional representation The two larger parties will adopt centrist positions while the smaller parties will tend to adopt positions that are ideologically dispersed  My  showed that from the very first election under this system in 1996 until 2009 this was more or less what happened Candidates from the LDP and the Democratic Party camps dominated competition in the SMDs and each adopted similar ideological positions And the PR competition was dominated by those parties and a raft of smaller ones which adopted positions that were distinct from one anotherWe know it is the SMD/PR combination that spawned this type of ideological competition because Japan used a different electoral system prior to 1996  and competition in that system was quite different Under Japans old electoral system people ran in districts and voters had one vote but more than one candidate wonIn some districts the top three candidates on the vote-tally board won seats In others the top four or five vote-getters won In this system no one converged Candidates took pains to distinguish themselves from every other candidate in their district even those from the same partyIn 2009 the equilibrium of convergence in the positions of the two large parties and divergence in the positions of the smaller parties suddenly unraveled Polls predicting a landslide by the Democratic Party released the pressure on these candidates to remain centrist and united Candidates with left-leaning preferences moved left while ones with right-leaning preferences moved rightAfter winning the election Democratic Party leaders proved unable to rein in these divisions and the partys support  Three years later the LDP which had remained united and centrist was back  Unseating Abes LDP will take a party that is large united and centrist Forming a party that satisfies all three criteria would be a tall order in any political system But the inclusion of PR makes it an even taller order in JapanThe fact that parties can gain a modicum of national-level representation with preferences that are not supported by a majority of voters means politicians dont need to compromise on those preferences They can still win seats even without adhering to a centrist platform that could gain the support of a majority of votersJapans system facilitates the formation of multiple opposition parties Even though these parties capture the bulk of their seats in PR they also run candidates in SMDs This has the effect of  the non-LDP vote helping to secure victory for LDP candidatesTwo weeks ago it appeared the Hope Party was close to satisfying the three criteria It had a platform that resembled the LDPs a  candidates were required to sign to verify their commitment to this platform and a stock of candidates ready to run But Hope made a mistake by expecting candidates with track records of opposing key aspects of this platform to do an about-face The credibility of the new party and its candidates was quickly called into question and the party lost much of its Notwithstanding the drama in the campaign Sundays elections look set to hand a tidy  to the LDP Until a new party emerges that can truly be large united and centrist Japans elections will continue to revolve around the size of the LDPs majority rather than which party will winJeb Bush who sought to join his father and brother in winning the White House suspended his campaign for the presidency Saturday night after a long year-long slide in the polls and a disappointing showing in the South Carolina primaryIm proud of the campaign we won to unify our country and to advocate conservative solutions  But the people of Iowa New Hampshire and South Carolina have spoken Bush said to a hotel ballroom full of staffers donors and longtime friends some of whom burst into tears Tonight I am suspending my campaignNo someone shoutedYeah he said before the room burst into applauseI congratulate my competitors that are remaining on the islandBush pointedly did not name any of his Republican rivals during his short speech but said In this campaign I have stood my ground refusing to bend to the political windsBushs decision followed a devastating loss in the Palmetto State a state that handed both his father and brother crucial victories but that has shifted toward a much more strident form of Republicanism in the years since Bush was also under intensifying pressure from party leaders to clear the field so they could coalesce around a challenger to Donald TrumpThe former Florida governors decision potentially frees tens of millions of dollars in financial support to other Republican presidential contenders The most immediate beneficiary is expected to be Sen Marco Rubio (R-Fla) who has ties to several of Bushs top bundlers many of whom have said that the senator is their second choiceBushs departure also removes the most high-profile contender from the GOPs establishment wing While Bush has never lived or worked in Washington or held federal office he was cast as a favorite of the party elite given his family lineage and close ties to many of the partys most generous backers and senior leadersBushs decision ends a campaign that began with great confidence and anticipation After almost a year of private deliberation with close aides he first hinted at a presidential campaign shortly after Thanksgiving in 2014 and quickly built a team that included several aides from his two terms as Florida governor and other seasoned advisersThe new Bush team trumpeted a shock and awe strategy that methodically amassed an unprecedented amount of money for his campaign and an allied super PAC Bushs super PAC Right to Rise USA raised $118million in 2015 to spend mostly on advertising attacking other GOP candidates Right to Rise had spent at least $957million backing him through FridayThe advertising strategy forced former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney to accelerate his decision-making about another candidacy this year But it did not deter potential rivals  most notably Rubio a one-time Bush protg who proved to be a more capable campaigner than his mentorDespite his commanding financial edge and early lead in polls Bush was a technocrat in a world of noise He obsessed over details of his exhaustive policy plans but abhorred political stagecraft He relished giving minutes-long answers to simple questions during intimate town hall meetings with voters but struggled to give succinct answers in televised debates watched by millionsBush began slipping in public opinion polls last spring He slipped further after struggling over four days in May to answer questions about George W Bushs decision to launch the Iraq war an ordeal that exposed him as unable and unwilling to answer a broader question on the minds of many voters Why should Americans elect another president named BushDuring a May 11 interview on the Fox News Channel Jeb Bush said that like his brother he would have authorized military action against Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein even though government intelligence used at the time was later deemed deeply flawed Opponents in both parties quickly pounced saying they would not have authorized the war Some also suggested that Jeb Bush did not fully appreciate lingering widespread opposition to the warThe interview prompted voters to press Bush to explain his answer First he said he had misunderstood the question Then he denounced the publics focus on hypothetical questions During an especially hostile exchange caught on camera after a rally in Reno Nev Bush sparred with a college student over whether George W Bush or President Obama was responsible for the rise of the Islamic State terror group A day later amid intense growing scrutiny Bush conceded that knowing what we know now he would not have authorized war in IraqQuestions about his family lingered throughout the campaign but Bush insisted several times that a presidential campaign cant be about the past it cant be about my mom and dad or my brother who I love It has to be about the ideas I believe in to move our country forwardAl Cardenas a longtime Bush friend said last summer that Bushs lead had shrunk because media attention was too focused on Bushs family history and not on his record as Florida governor Its about Bush not Jeb he saidOnce people learned more about his time as governor Cardenas predicted then it will become more about Jeb not BushIn the end though Bush brought his family close to him Former president George W Bush joined his younger brother at a rally for him outside Charleston this past week and his mother joined him on the trail for a final slog through South CarolinaBush also struggled to deal with Trump who used television interviews Twitter and campaign rallies to mock Bush in deeply personal terms In a particularly stinging critique that stuck Trump accused Bush  who lost 40pounds before launching his bid and maintaining an aggressive campaign schedule  of being a low-energy candidate lacking the stamina and demeanor needed to defeat Democratic front-runner Hillary ClintonBush initially ignored Trumps attacks making him seem unaware of the quickly changing dynamics of the Republican Party His muted response to Trump raised questions about whether a candidate who last ran for political office in 2002 was capable of operating in the modern political environmentThe mockery and personal nature of the attacks had roots in the often-tense relationship between Trump and the Bushes that dated to the late 1980s when George HW Bush briefly considered picking the businessman as his 1988 vice-presidential running mateSeveral times Jeb Bush complained about the increasingly fast-paced media-driven hostile nature of American politics After struggling through the first few televised debates Bush admitted that he needed to embrace a new strategy contradictory to his patrician upbringingIve had 62years of life thats been jammed into my DNA that when somebody asks you a question youre supposed to answer it he told reporters after a campaign stop in Atlantic Iowa in November He added that Im learning the new art of acknowledging the question being respectful of the questioner of course and then answering whats on my mindAsked whether that was a change from his 1998 and 2002 campaigns for Florida governor Bush said Thats a change from 1953 when I was a babyOver the course of his campaign Bush rejected the tactics of tea-party-backed lawmakers who had supported a shutdown of the federal government and opposed then-House Speaker John A Boehner (R-Ohio) and other leaders He had been a strong supporter of educational reform adopted nationally known as Common Core and wrote a 300-page book outlining his views on comprehensive immigration reform  views that put him at odds with many RepublicansBefore launching the exploratory phase of his campaign Bush said in December 2014 that the party nominee should be willing to lose the primary to win the general without violating your principlesHe vowed to campaign joyfully saying that Republicans could only retake the White House if they reached out to voters who did not typically support conservatives In the closing weeks of his campaign he cast himself as a steady hand ready to be commander in chiefIf you want a politician to just bob and weave then Im not your guy he told supporters Friday night in CentralYou cant talk trash when youre running for president  You cant focus-group things You cant be a poll-driven politician who runs away when things get tough he added in Spartanburg on FridayBush knew this he said because Ive had a front-row seat watching history made by his father George HW Bush and his brother George W BushUltimately Jeb Bushs quest to make presidential history failedAs he departed the ballroom Bush had tears in his eyes On the rope line he apologized to staffers and supporters but told one friend that they will now be able to have a beer togetherSorry brother he told anotherStaffers and supporters stood stunned in the ballroom as he made the announcement with only a handful aware of what he was about to sayThis is a cycle that is bigger than all of us said Bushs senior adviser Sally Bradshaw as she hugged her staff and Bushs national finance chairman Woody JohnsonBush sat watching returns with his wife Columba in a hotel suite with staff in an adjoining room according to a senior adviser His brothers Marvin and Neil were in the hotel also but it was not immediately clear whether he phoned George HW Bush and brother George W BushAs he departed Bush was asked by a reporter when he knew it was over This afternoon this evening he said before turning to leaveSeveral aides said that early exit-poll returns immediately showed that he was trailing by an insurmountable marginBefore he announced the end of his campaign several close friends from the Miami area sent him words of support knowing that the end might be nearI pray for you to stay strong as youve been and you know how to be wrote his friend Jorge Arrizurieta who was still urging him to stay in the raceOhio Gov John Kasich (R) whoran as a sunny center-right prince of light and hope but won only his home-state primary bowed out of the presidential race Wednesday with a reflective speech in ColumbusThroughout this campaign I said the Lord may have another purpose for me Kasich said As I suspend my campaign today I have renewed faith deeper faith that the Lord will show me the way forward and purpose for my lifeThe departure fully clears the field for front-runner Donald Trump to become the GOP nominee Another rival Sen Ted Cruz (Tex) ended his bid Tuesday night Kasich 63 entered the race with an impressive rsum 18 years in the House where he built a reputation as a budget cutter a stint as a Fox News Channel host and five years as the popular governor of a presidential swing state He ran as a pragmatic conservative one who had defied his own party and expanded Medicaid the federal health-care program for the poor in Ohio People have accused me of at times having too big a heart Kasich said in one GOP debate That centrist appeal made him stand out in a year when candidates scrambled to the right In polls Kasich seemed like the GOPs most formidable general-election candidateBut he never got thereKasich was the last serious candidate to enter the race one he had spent 16 years preparing for In 1999 as the chairman of the House Budget Committee he had run for president on the bipartisan success of balancing the nations books for the first time since the 1960s He flamed out quickly and later admitted to New Hampshire audiences that he wasnt ready for the big job Seemingly done with politics he took a job at Lehman Brothers and hosted Fox Newss Heartland which spotlighted inspirational stories amid discussions of politics He wrote three books in the same vein In 2010 with a voter backlash creating an unexpected opportunity in Ohio he ran against Gov Ted Strickland (D) and won In 2014 after his Democratic opponent was felled by scandal he won reelection in a landslideThat encouraged Kasich to make another run for the White House  as did the failure of former Florida governor Jeb Bush to gain any traction Suddenly a politician known by his foes for sarcasm and a short attention span was running as an optimistic party saviorThe new Kasich like the one who had hosted Heartland was part candidate and part life coach Pacing around a stage in shirt sleeves and chinos Kasich would frequently single out young people in the audience and give them impromptu life lessons God made you special he said at one of his last town halls in Connecticut Do you know that Did anyone ever tell you that Theres never been anybody like you and there never will be anyone like you again You were put here for a purposeThat message a disastrous debate for Sen Marco Rubio (R-Fla) and a surge from independent voters helped Kasich place second in New Hampshires primary By the end of February he was the last Republican governor in the raceThe high point of Kasichs campaign came on March 15 when he won the Ohio primary He was showered in confetti and promised to return to Ohio this fall as the GOP nominee Im getting ready to rent a covered wagon he said then Were going to have a big sail and have the wind blow us to the Rocky Mountains and over the mountains to CaliforniaIt was an odd metaphor but an apt one After Ohio Kasich performed about as well as somebody trying to cross the Rockies in a sail-powered wagonKasich made odd strategic choices He campaigned in Utah even though rival Cruz was expected to dominate there  and did as the slow-building #NeverTrump movement warned Kasich that he was splitting the vote Kasich campaigned in New York the home turf of rival Trump and hurt his own cause when he seemed to explain Judaism to Jewish voters in Brooklyn In the end Kasich was trounced in the East Coast states where he was expected to do best In six primaries he won just a single county ManhattanThe rest all went to Trump Having argued that he could slow Trump down in states where Cruz was toxic he was right only about Cruz The mogul soon applied one of his famous nicknames to Kasich One-for-38At each stop Kasich promised not to take the low road to the White House One of his most reliable applause lines it frequently neutralized him as a potential critic of Trump The day he won Ohio he told reporters that he had been watching video clips of women reading insulting Trump quotes (a product of the anti-Trump Our Principles PAC) and would have something to say about it soon He never mentioned the quotes again In Indiana Kasich first appeared to agree to a deal with Cruz in which Kasich would withdraw and leave Cruz to face Trump alone In turn Kasich would not be challenged by Cruz in two later and less-critical states Oregon and New MexicoBut Kasich appeared to undercut that deal quickly by saying that his supporters in Indiana should not shift their votes Ive never told them not to vote for me they ought to vote for me he said Strategists for both camps were both convinced that they had snookered the other Cruz even chided reporters for calling the deal an alliance as it was clear that Indiana voters had turned on itFor weeks it had been clear that Kasich could not clinch the Republican nomination with the delegates still available to be won in primaries In fact even as the race dwindled to three active candidates Kasich was in fourth place  with fewer delegates than Sen Marco Rubio (Fla) who had dropped out weeks earlierFundraising was also a problem The governor raised less than $17million in all by the end of March forcing him to run a lean campaign He began April with just $11million in the bank (Cruz by comparison raised nearly $80million) Because of his meager fundraising Kasich has leaned heavily on two super PACs which together brought in more than $26million and financed much of his television advertising Kasichs last hope was that Trump also would be denied 1237 delegates and that he would be chosen in an open party convention By late April his delegate-hunters were having some success in electing allies in states like Indiana and teaming up with Cruz forces to win delegates in ArizonaOn Wednesday morning the delegate team was still at work when the word came in The campaign was over Kasich had actually boarded the plane that was set to take him to Washington for a news conference and fundraiser Then he had huddled with aides and decided to stay home and end the campaign He would use his last moment in the national spotlight for one more session of life coaching a 20-minute speech that touched on everything from the majesty of Michigans Upper Peninsula to the hugs he had given at town hallsI believe we all need to live a life bigger than ourselves Kasich said We are as human beings kind of hard-wired to give someone else a lift to give someone else an opportunity Matea Gold contributed to this reportThe way John Oliver sees it the moment was a no-brainer for President TrumpWhite

do was denounce the Nazis  but he didntIn a country where previous presidents have actually had to defeat Nazis we now have one who cannot even be bothered to fing condemn them Oliver   It simply doesnt get easier than disavowing Nazis Its as much of a presidential gimme as pardoning a fing turkey It is almost impossible to screw it up But thats exactly what happenedOliver was part of a growing chorus of people who torchedthe president for not going far enough to condemn the hatred and bigotry at the heart of the violent display at Emancipation ParkSpeaking hours after the outbreak of violence the president told reporters We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred bigotry and violence on many sides Then for emphasis he added On many sidesAs The

emotional duress after allegedly being physically and verbally harassed for some time The details of the alleged harassment have not been made public by Olivo or lawmakers The woman involved has not been identified and has not made any statements about the allegations or the settled claim which What is clear is that thecomplaints were against some top Republican lawmakers including Hoover They also includedReps Brian Linder (Dry Ridge) Michael Meredith (Oakland) and Jim DeCesare(Bowling Green) according to the Herald-Leader A complaintwas also made against House Republican Caucus Chief of Staff Ginger Wills who is accused of creating a hostile work environment  The employee said she was worried about coming back to work because of what she described as a hostile environment She confided in Olivo who said she feared for the employees well-being and brought the matter up with Hoover the top lawmaker in the Republican-dominated statehouseOlivo said Hoover told her that he would consider the matter Instead she told the Herald Leader he did nothingThe same happened when she approached Wills and House Republican general counsel Laura Hendrix They denied that a cultural issue existed Olivo saidAt the same time Olivo says the legislators also sought to silence herSince I reported this to Jeff Hoover I have become effectively isolated Olivo told the Herald-Leader She said she had been stripped of her primary job talking to the news mediaWe have been shut out of everythingWhile she hasnt been speaking to the media Olivo said she has been talking to the FBI which is

period he said Saturday For every elected official in Kentucky you either publicly condemn or you publicly condone this type of behavior periodThese are hallowed hallsLane Kiffin has done a pretty good job getting Florida Atlantic back on its feet in his first season The Owls are 6-3 and bowl-eligible after Friday nights win over Marshall a game in which FAU was a six-point favoriteThat last bit was very very important to anyone who had a little extra interest in the game if you catch my drift  The Owls were up 30-23 with 230 left after an interception gave them the ball near midfield Marshall was out of timeouts so the game appeared to be over and FAUs point-spread cover secure Kiffin told his offense to take a knee but messed up the timing Three kneel-downs were not going to kill 230 off the clock So the Owlshad to punt with 14 seconds leftWhat followed will go down in bad-beat lore Remember FAU was a six-point favoriteFAU was -6  Barstool Sports (@barstooltweetss) Your final score Florida Atlantic 30 Marshall 25Freed from Nick Sabans no-fun shackles this season Alabamas former offensive coordinator seems to have found his social-media voice and that continued after the game when Kiffin said on Twitter that he didnt want to cover the spread because of too much rat poison another jab at his former bosss contention that any good press the Crimson Tide gets is akin to rat poisonA Florida Atlantic spokesman  that Kiffin was just joking It remains to be seen whether the NCAA which is staunchly opposed to sports gambling and probably doesnt like its coaches joking about it is laughingThose dudes out there on the College Football Playoff selection committee clearly arent slackers They do all the hard thinking necessary for an impossible sportFive of the 13 members  12 for the first rankings of 2017 released Tuesday as one was sick and unable to travel  are retired coaches and while coaches might have called the wrong play every single time for decadesthey do know how to work beyond even the usual unhealthy American degree They study film even of  a miserable existence that alone might justify their salariesIts odd then that coaches have spent a good chunk of American history  the college football chunk  as such lazy lousy poll voters Just this past weekend the  placed Miami (Fla) at No 6 and Notre Dame at No 8 probably because the former is 7-0 and the latter is 7-1 even though the latter has demonstrated oodles more prowess than the formerA worst case of coach-voting howls from 1996 yet it does relate to the committees decision Tuesday that  Just thinking of the daunting 1996 case can make one grateful the republic survived it  Nebraska was the two-time defending national champion and its 1995 team was inarguably the best team in the modern history of the game (All college football arguments should contain the word inarguably) On Saturday night Sept 21 1996 No 1 Nebraska went to Arizona State and got dominated 19-0 Nebraska quarterback Scott Frost who obviously  completed 6 of 20 passes and played a supporting role in each of Arizona States safetiesOn Monday Sept 23 members of the media able to read 19-0 lit up on a scoreboard adjusted lifting Arizona State from No 17 to No 6 and dropping Nebraska from No 1 to No 8 Coaches however lacked the basic reasoning skills to decipher 19-0 so they moved Arizona State from No 22 to No 12 while keeping Nebraska five spots ahead at No 7 From there for three more weeks a one-loss Nebraska remained ahead of an unbeaten team that had crushed it The coaches didnt even notice their brains filled grimly with practice filmIn their laziness  which might have included having somebody else in the athletic departments do the polls for them  the coaches factored in something that has no business getting factored reputation The College Football Playoff selection committee which has spent three-plus seasons as an improvement omits reputation as best humans can What you did last year or 10 years ago or in 1950 doesnt matter This held true even in 2014 with Ohio State despite rumblings to the contraryThe football at Alabama has been so impressive for so long that we come to think of Alabama as No 1 as part of national identity If the committee arrived to the meeting room in North Texas and found little sheets with Alabama inked in at No 1 so it could go ahead and start working on Nos 2-25 many of us might nod and say Of course Of the 20 rankings the committee has spat out Alabama has held down No 1 in 10 of them Half One program Half Of the three playoffs thus far Alabama has appeared in three Its otherworldlyBefore the first rankings of 2017 on Tuesday many pundits had Alabama at No 1 and while that wasnt even close to irrational you had to wonder how many of them did factor in reputation Alabama the best Further if Alabama played Georgia this coming Saturday Alabama inarguably would win (All college football arguments should contain the word inarguably)The 13-member committee however deciphers nothing but nine weeks chockablock with evidence Unlike the traditional polls it doesnt have a preseason poll to which to adhere with a No 1 in August that becomes hard to dislodge if it doesnt lose It has no September polls to structure things It barely had any October polls this year It doesnt even observe other polls according to its chairmanGeorgia coming off an 8-5 season in the debut year of Kirby Smart who spent nine seasons at Alabama alongside Nick Saban began the year in the Associated Press poll at No 15 making for thick climbing once the football began Yet once the football did begin Georgia fashioned the finer CV by a notchIt has beaten two current top-25 teams to zero for Alabama It beat one of those Notre Dame on the road and then Notre Dame surged to No 3 in the playoff rankings with its own three decimations of top-25 teams Mississippi State stands at No 16 with its 6-2 record but that record was spotless until it went to Georgia and took a 31-3 right mauling Alabamas commendable turn of nonconference scheduling against then-No 3 Florida State in the season opener lost its oomph with Florida States plunge to 2-5Thats not Alabamas fault but it has to count in a sport so imperfectWith that kind of thing and with the stashing of unbeaten teams Wisconsin and Miami (Fla) at Nos 9 and 10 behind six one-loss teams with better CVs the committee has marked a leap upward from previous methods and a spaceship trip upward from the wasteland of 1996 This crew with its upgraded set of voting coaches keeps sending a messageProbably wasnt a coach who came up with thatI mean no offense You sound a little bit like my mom Redskins offensive lineman Tony Bergstrom told me this week Ill get a text from my mom Hows everything Are you making friends Are they being nice to you Yeah Mom Its cool Its all right Mom I promiseHeychange is hard for all of us Tonys mom and I are just worried about him is all Two months after her son suddenly switched jobs and cities  he was traded just before this NFL season from Arizona to Baltimore  the 31-year-old was forced to pull up stakes yet again The injury-ravaged Ravens last month had released Bergstrom and then re-signed Bergstrom and then released Bergstrom again all within a five-day span The veteran guard had been waiting to see whether the Ravens would sign him backwhen the Redskins told him they were hiring sohe threw his duffel bag in the back of his rental Hyundai Santa Fe and headed to Redskins Parknot even realizing his destinationwas in Virginia That was last Wednesday By Sunday he was playing in an actual gameIts been a little wacky Bergstrom agreed I mean thats life now Thats how a lot of guys in the NFL liveCertainly its how the hobbled Redskins linemen have been living That battered group picked up three new additions over four days last week Orlando Franklin Bergstrom and his former Ravens teammate ArieKouandjio  who had been commuting from Ashburn to Owings Mills and now suddenly found his commute slashedfrom hellish to non-existentWhile Kouandjios new job was minutes from his house and Bergstrom just needed to swing around a couple of beltways Franklin logged significantly more miles He had flown to DC to try out for the Redskins last Wednesday the same day Bergstrom signed Team officials told the veteran tackle they likely would sign him after Sundays game against Dallas so Thursday he flew back home to Denver On Friday the Redskins told him he needed to fly back right away On Saturday he signed with the team On Sunday he suited up for a game  and also met his new starting quarterbackKind of walked out of the bathroom made eye contact and we went up to each other and introduced ourselves Franklin saidIntroduced myself and said Look forward to working with you today although hopefully we dont have to use you  Kirk Cousins joked during his weekly radio appearance on 1067 The FanMIts been pretty crazyNot just for the linemen either Linebacker Preston Smith  that he already knows over 50 percent of the new guys names  Jokes aside the human element to the roster churn always has jolted me Bergstrom played in Houston in 2016  he still owns a condo there He signed with the Cardinals in May living in an Airbnb in Arizona On Sept 1 he was traded to the Ravens and he soon found a short-term fully furnished sublet from an Owings Mills couple who was wintering in Nigeria Before Baltimores season opener in CincinnatiLuke Bowanko another RavensSeptember addition looked at BergstromMBergstrom could sympathize On Oct 19 Coach John Harbaugh toldhim he was being released but that he almost certainly would be re-signed Thatleft Bergstrom temporarily unemployed so the next day he drove down to DC to do some sightseeing Before he even made it to the Holocaust Museum GM Ozzie Newsome called and told him to come back to Baltimore The next week he was released again and this time the Redskins  for whom he had worked out in the spring  pouncedHopefully its because I was a good player Bergstrom said As it turned out all three of Washingtons new linemen were active last Sunday Kouandjio and Bergstrom were on the field during Washingtons final drive The newcomers say NFL blocking schemes are so similar that the real trick is picking up new terminology and that NFL linemen have enough of a fraternity that its not like moving to a new high school halfway through the year (FThat makes sense and of course impermanence is inherent in professional sports But these wholesale changes still feel dramatic And in such a brutal and unforgiving game how do you motivate yourself to put your body on the line for the burgundy and gold just a week after you were just doing the same thing for the purple and Zubaz and two months after you were doing the same thing for the cardinal and KangolI get what youre saying [but]Good dudes  and a lot of dudes tooT  The offensive lines health seems to be trending in the right direction although dont expect to see Trent Williams in uniform Sunday Its also possible one of the newcomers might be gone by Sunday what with the Redskins needing to add a safety before facing the Seahawks Good thing too Every comfortable chair in offensive line coach Bill Callahans meeting room has been claimedWe have the exact amount that we need right now Roullier said Any new additions would be in the uncomfortable chairs in the backTheyd be sitting on Bills lap Bergstrom addedBefore I left the locker room  not knowing whether I would see Bergstrom the next time I visited or never again in my life  I asked him what hes hoping for out of the rest of the season He laughedStability would be nice he said While reassuring your mother that everything will be fineNick Bata concedes that his Make America Rape Again comment could have been executed a little better but he wants to clear a few things upHes not a Donald Trump supporter (Or a Hillary Clinton supporter for that matter Hes running as a )His campaign slogan is not Make America Rape Again He made apunny jokeAnd although he has qualms aboutwhat he calls an out-of-control obsession withrape culture he is not and has never been pro-rapeThis is just an online discussion that got a little bit wacky its all academic he said in a Facebook message to The Washington Post He declined to be interviewed by telephone saying his words had been mischaracterized by other news organizations Its an online argument Everyone has been apart of one of these and most of the times they turn out ugly just like this one didThe conversationstarted on Sept 30 when Batas (now former) Facebook friendJess Roscoe posted a about a womans explanation of the term consentI dont get how rape is so hard to understand for some men But if you put it like this they get it nafisa ahmed (@thatxxv) The Buzzfeed story was about a Twitter thread that comparedgiving consent to giving someone $5Theres only one realway to give someone $5 the argument goes everything else is stealingRoscoe thought it was a very cool way to explain consent to people who might not understand it or understand why its such a big issue nowIt was just a casualpostNot for longThe first person to reply was Bata whotaught physical education to Roscoes younger sister Bata and Roscoe had exchanged political banter beforeHis reply Rape culture is a myth [social justice warriors] createdThe social media downward spiral was onBata brought up the Duke lacrosse and University of Virginiarape scandals In both cases the accusers were found to have liedGender activists created the Duke lacrosse UVA and other false rape scandals Making it harder for actual rape victims to be heard  How hard is it for some men Do you really think the US men or college campuses are pro-rape or promote immunity for rapeI love hearing different perspectives and I think he does too Roscoe said She leans left Hes a Libertarian espousing a political philosophy that is generally skeptical of political and economic systems We usually just have good political conversations Hell say these are three reasons why youre wrong Ill say here are three reasons why youre crazy  things like that  This is the first time things really went negativeThe problem Roscoe said was not Batas opinion She and her Facebook friends took issue with what they saw as his flippant dismissal of the crime of rape Friends who have been victims of sexual assault have been approaching Roscoe for weeks telling her Batas comments burnedPerhaps theworst comment came nearly two weeks after the initial post Bata had been going back and forth with a man named Juan Carlos Gomez and a few others for daysWhy are you so dead set against seeing the reality women live through on a daily basis Gomez asked Is the reality that women you care about go through this too much for you to handle Or can you be so arrogant to think that only your life experience is validMake America rape again Bata replied shortly afterA day later Batas opponent for insurance commissioner Ruth Buffalo seized on his comments and put out a newsreleaseThe people of North Dakota deserve an Insurance Commissioner who has an appropriate temperament for the office and who is compassionate to victims of sexual assault These comments are completely unacceptable We call upon Mr Bata and the Libertarian Party of North Dakota to apologize and recant these statementsThe Libertarian Party did not return phone messages left SaturdayThe comment was made whilethe Make America great again candidate Donald Trump is at the epicenter of a growing national discussion about consent The Washington Post published a 2005 video of Trump bragging to Access Hollywood host Billy Bush that he could grope and kiss women without their permission because he was a celebrity A few days later during the presidential debate he told Anderson Cooper he had never touched a woman without her consent Since then a series of women have come forward saying yes Trump hadIn a Saturday tweet Trump called the allegations 100 percent fabricated and made-up charges pushed strongly by the media and the Clinton CampaignPrompted by the controversy thousands of people have shared stories of being sexually assaulted on social media using the hashtag #NotOkayRoscoe said thats why she went public about Batas acerbic comments on her Facebook page  because hes asking people to elect him to a publicofficeI think the voters need to know about this she said It speaks to a temperament and a perspective Im not endorsing ordemonizing him but this is the thing that should be looked at when youre thinking who to vote forHe said he believes the attention is overblown for what amounts to a Facebook commentI made that comment as an individual This has nothing to do with the party he said I regret that we live in a society that is so worried about not offending anyone and less interested in intellectual inquiry and diversity of opinionsThe top US diplomat and top defense official moved again Thursday to clarify the Trump administrations North Korea policy making clear that it is focused on diplomatic and economic pressure and that American military action is currently contemplated only in response to an attack by PyongyangIn close collaboration with our allies there are strong military consequences if DPRK initiates hostilities Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said using the initials of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea Very simply in the event of a missile launch toward the territory of Japan Guam the United States [South] Korea we would take immediate specific actions to take it downHis remarks fell between Presidents Trumps warning last week that the United States was prepared to respond militarily to Pyongyangs threats of an attack and this weeks  that North Korea was a sideshow to which there was no military solutionIn the whirlwind of successive controversies and crises that have become the hallmark of the Trump administration domestic strife in Charlottesville has quickly overtaken last weeks worry about war with North KoreaBut even as attention has rapidly shifted at home partners in East Asia and beyond have continued to seek reassurance that the United States will defend them as vigorously as it will protect itself if necessary while refraining from initiating a shooting war on its own  In Seoul on Thursday South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he had received assurances from visiting Gen Joseph F Dunford Jr chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the United States would take no military action against North Korea without first getting his governments agreementDunford said that there was no question Seoul would be consulted and that everything we do in the region is in the context of our allianceIn Washington Mattis spoke alongside Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  following a bilateral security meeting Along with Dunford they have repeatedly tried to inject calm and a sense of strategy into differing administration messages that have unsettled allies and the American publicContributing to the concern was Trumps national security adviser HR McMaster who this month told a group of current and former senior US national security officials and foreign policy experts that preventive war with North Korea was one of the viable military options under considerationThe term is sometimes used interchangeably with preemptive action although the latter refers more often to forestalling an imminent attack Japans 1941 bombing of US ships docked at Pearl Harbor is widely considered the classic example of a preventive operationMcMaster in an earlier interview broadcast on MSNBC said that Pyongyangs possession of nuclear weapons capable of attacking the United States was intolerable from the presidents perspective and that military options for eliminating that threat were being providedVice President Pence on a visit this week to Chile said that alloptions are on the table regarding North Korea Althoughthere were glimmers of hope that nonmilitary pressurewould make a difference Pence said that the United States would simply not permit Pyongyang to possess usable nuclear weapons that can reach the continental United StatesThe sense of imminent military conflict began to escalate last month when North Korea conducted two test launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles that put the whole US mainland within Pyongyangs reach according to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un Later reports said that US intelligence officials had concluded that  to mount on the missilesWe will handle North Korea We are going to be able to handle them Trump told reporters On Twitter he said he was very disappointed in China Pyongyangs primary economic partner They do NOTHING for us with North Korea just talk We will no longer allow this to continueOn Aug5 the UN Security Council voted unanimously in favor of a US-drafted resolution imposing harsh new economic sanctions on North Korea Over the next few days Pyongyang said it would respond ruthlessly with physical actions Trump said that North Korea best not make any more threats or it would be met with fire and fury and frankly power the likes of which this world has never seen beforePyongyang then upped the ante saying it was considering a plan to launch missiles toward Guam Trump tweeted that the US military was locked and loaded  Throughout the rhetorical escalation Tillerson and Mattis have tried to lower the temperature without overtly disagreeing with Trump They began this week with a joint opinion piece published by the Wall Street Journal repeating that the United States sought denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula but was not trying to get rid of the government in PyongyangOn Monday Mattis acknowledged that it would be a wartime situation if North Korea fired a missile toward Guam If they do that then its game on he told reporters indicating that such a missile would be shot downBut lets not do this okay folks Lets not start saying General Mattis said its warWe will defend the country  hear me now  we will defend the country from any attack at any time from any quarter But it is not declaring war Its not that Im over here you know Dr Strangelove you know doing things like that okayThe next day North Koreas state media said that Kim would put the Guam attack on hold and watch a little longer before deciding what to do Trump tweeting in response called that a very wise and well reasoned decisionLate Wednesday Bannons comments appeared to have come out of left field The administration he said in an interview published by  magazine should give up trying to persuade China to clamp down on North Korea and should instead proceed with tough trade sanctions against BeijingTheres no military solution [to North Koreas nuclear threats] forget it Bannon said Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul dont die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons I dont know what youre talking about Bannon went on the magazine reported to describe a battle inside the administration over whether to go easy on China in what he considered the vain hope it would restrain PyongyangTillerson on Thursday declined to comment on Bannons remarks I think we have been quite clear as to what the policy and the posture toward North Korea is he saidWhat he and Mattis want to do he said is to inform the American people first but also inform our important friends and allies as to what our approach isThat approach  diplomatic and economic pressure with military options ready if needed  is different from pressure campaigns under previous administrations Tillerson said because of the level of international unity around this campaign the level of cooperation we are getting from China and from others in the regionTrump Tillerson said just felt it was necessary to remind the [North Korean] regime of what the consequences for them would be if they make a bad choice for themselves Carol Morello Anne Gearan and Adam Entous in Washington and Anna Fifield in Seoul contributed to this reportDefense Secretary Jim Mattis was trending on Twitter overnight praised by the LGBT organization GLAAD and hailed by some as a hero for openly defying Trumpby disregarding the presidentsorder Some on Twitter confessed they never thought they would be cheering on generals or ex-generals for refusing to carry out the orders of the commander in chiefMattis now OPENLY DEFYING  joining fellow Administration officials  &  in repudiating  this week alone  Fernand R Amandi (@AmandiOnAir) HERO Defense Sec Mattis allows  to serve for now and orders study rather than implement  unconstitutional order Anne Frank Center (@AnneFrankCenter) But defying orders was not what Mattis was doingWhat Mattis did Tuesday with President Trumps ban on transgender people in the military was to freeze itsBut such a delay was pretty much authorized by Trump in (as opposed to his tweet) delivered to Mattis and the Department of Homeland Security on Aug 25 It saidAs part of the implementation plan the Secretary of Defense in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security shall determine how to address transgender individuals currently serving in the United States military Until the Secretary has made that determination no action may be taken against such individuals That sounds an awful lot like a freeze or at least an invitation to one Mattis gladly accepted itMattis did not reverse Trump or defy him on the broader ban against new recruits who are transgender peopleThe Obama administration June 2016 A year later in June 2017 Mattis delayed the effective date to allow military leaders to review it There was no change made by Mattis on that count on TuesdayMattis declared in his statement that a panel of experts would be set up to provide advice and recommendations on the implementation ofthe presidents direction Once the panel delivers some recommendations Mattis continued hell go back to the president That could give Mattis an opening to quash the ban entirely But he did not do that TuesdayMattis could justifiably state as he did that far from defying the president he was only carrying out the presidents policy direction and acting as directedNone of this could have surprised Trump On Aug 14that once he got directions from the White House the Pentagon would study it and come up with what the policy should beAfter consultation with my Generals and military experts please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the US Military Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail Thank you Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Still its understandable why some might see defiance in Mattiss actionThe administrations actions at this point are some distance from Trumps bold tweets on July 26 when declaring that he had consulted his generals he proclaimed that the military would not accept or allow transgender people to serve in any capacityAs it turned out Trump had not consulted his generals And their reception was coldMattis who was on vacation was by Trumps action Gen Joseph F Dunford Jr chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in a letter to senior military leaders said that there would be no modifications to the current policy on transgender troops until further direction was received from the president as In the meantime we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect Dunford saidThat further direction came on Aug 25 in the form of thethat as giving the military considerable flexibility on the entire transgender policyThat too compared to Trumps tweet sounded mild though its potential impact was anything butAlyssa Milano took to Twitter on Sunday with an idea suggested by a friend she saidShe urged any women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted to write two words on Twitter Me tooIf all the women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote Me too as a status we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem wrote the actress who is known for her roles in Whos the Boss Melrose Place and

Chapman and wrote in a that shewas sickened by the disturbing sexual abuse allegations againsthimWomen listened Within hours tweets with the words me too began appearing in drovesBy 4am Monday more than 200000 #metoo tweets were published by Twitters count The stories came pouring forth on Facebook as well with nearly 80000 people said to be talking about this by the wee hours MondayThe messages were striking in their simplicity and in the sheer number of themThosetwo words soon became a hashtag the top trend nationwide on Twitterand yet another rallying cry for women  and men who have experienced some type of sexual harassment or assaultMany shared brief but painful personal stories of their experiences some reaching back to their teen years others to bad memories of abuse in the workplace never revealed of troubles they encountered in their families and of their own silence in the face of harassment or assault#MeToo When I served in the military  More than a few times I stayed silent for self preservation I regret it dailyI imagine there are teen girls who havent told their parents theyve been threatened groped even WORSE just like I didntI have been raped twice in my lifestalked four times and was threatened with my life when I tried to speak out @ 14There was the woman who said she was assaulted by a man who pretended to work at a local  and the  who saidshe was groped in an elevator by a superior who was nearly two decades older I never told anyone she saidrecounted how in the sixth grade a group of boys held her up against a wall as they pulled up her shirt to see if I stuffed my bra with Charmin or BountyThe boys barely got a slap on the wrist but I was socially ostracized because I couldnt take a joke she saidA number of men shared their stories

the past week I have heard from at least 6 different women I have known or just met about being sexually assaulted or harassed The lid is off Thank you for all your collective courage This piece had a good way forward   Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) The #MeToo Twitter campaign was at least the second of its kind since decades of sexual abuse allegations emerged against film producer Harvey WeinsteinOn Oct 5 the day the New York Times expose revealed the claims against Weinstein thousands ofpeople took to Twitter to share their own encounters with sexual harassment in the workplace using the hashtag Just over a year ago a similar response under the hashtag  followed a leaked 2005  video in which Donald Trump boasted about kissing and groping womenEach time this has happened predatory behavior once held in secrecy and still tolerated in many settings has become a little more public Victims who may have suffered in silence seem to feel liberated knowing theyre not aloneSome women and victims of sexual assault expressed that Sundays stream of tweets felt empowering For others the sheer volume of posts  the pervasiveness of the issue  was disturbing As NatalieAs I read all of the #Me Too posts out there I feel heartbroken So many women have been sexually assaulted And many in their youth As I think to myself its never happened to me I realize that while Ive not been sexually assaulted I have been sexually harassed (many times before) Sadly thats the case with most women at some point in their lives right  Seeing so many women vocalize that they have been sexually assaulted or harassed gives more women the courage and bravery to speak up tell someone and not feel so ashamedWe shouldnt have to out ourselves as survivors in order for people to grasp the magnitude of how systemic assault & harassment are Best Thing Finding out we are not alone and have all dealt with thisWorst Thing Finding out we have all dealt with this Paula (@therealpaulah) The fact that this is the top trend in the US UK and many other countries is surely telling you something Amy Hartman (@Amyyh18) Know what makes me angry That my 1st thought about this movement was But isnt that

mental repository of images analogies and metaphors searching for a suitable vehicle for faithfully telling it I arrive at nothing For how does one say plainly all that it is to be rapedOnly Ezekiel

then I passed by and saw you kicking about in your bloodDefiled Polluted Castoff Exposed Abhorred And most dreadful of all defenselessThis is what it feels like to be rapedI was 21 years old barely five months after returning to the Christian faith My rapist lived in the parsonage He was young serving as a youth pastor while attending a nearby seminary Id come roaring back to the faith after a brief dalliance with atheism and agnosticism My enthusiasm quickly secured me a position on the leadership team for the youth group within close working conditions of the youth pastor although I considered him to be one of my own pastors  Before long I began to notice strange questionable behaviors Phone calls flirtations casual references to meeting with married women in the middle of the night At first I thought my perception unreliable  after all he was the youth pastor the seminarian And I A heathen whose discernment could hardly be trusted But as the weeks wore on I grew more confident in my assessmentSo one evening as we carpooled to a youth leadership meeting I confronted him about his relationships with two married women in our church  mothers of children in the youth group I mentioned all I had witnessed and brought up his confessions of regular midnight meetings with one of the women whenever her husband was away on business His protestations of innocence were no match for the firmness of my judgment and he finally admitted that both women were in love with him He promised to break off the relationships if I would keep quietA week later the pastor showed up at my doorstep in the middle of the night ostensibly to escape the incessant phone calls of one of the women Before I knew it he was in my apartment behind me on top of me Immobilized I weptGuilt fell on me like a bucket of hot ash I wouldnt know until years later the  or  He said as much himself a week later when he called to apologize and to say You were just too much of a temptation for me He had argued that sexual sins were not as significant as other sins because sexual temptation came from outside of him and not from within his characterThe most difficult part was not the rape that act of unspeakable violation It was and always has been the horror of living in a body that has been raped However much I believed in my mind that I was responsible for what had happened my body knew better In the months (and years) following the attack I cringed in fear in the presence of any man  even my own father One night when he picked me up from work to take me to dinner I skulked as far as I could from him against the car door I hoped he wouldnt notice me white-knuckling the door handleFor years after I withdrew from any touch  even the casual familiar embrace of close family members Every time I entered a church I would break out in a cold sweat my heart palpitating so rapidly I feared a heart attackI could not understand it However I tried to rationalize to tell myself I was safe at church safe with men I trusted my body would not rest in the assurancesI feared I was losing my mind until I had a conversation with my counseling professor Halee this is so normal it has a name post-traumatic stress disorder Knowing that I was not crazy gave me a foundation upon which to get well Good friends too dug deep and challenged me to name that which had happened to me Halee what happened to you was rape and until you admit that you will never be well And I wanted to be wellWe sometimes think that the choice of life and death is at the beginning of our walk with God but this isnt so The task of the Christian life is to keep choosing life over and over There were times when the way of the grave seemed preferable to the harsh light of truth times when the darkness like a tempest threatened to engulf me But I wanted to live so I kept choosing life sometimes daily Again in Ezekiel 16 God said Then I passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood and as you lay there in your blood I said to you Live  So I didId always skeptically wondered why victims of sexual assault blame themselves But in the days following the attack I took full responsibility for it No longer do I wonder Its because the shoulds the woulds and the what-ifs are persuasive illusions that trick you into believing that if youd just done it all differently the outcome would have been different Its psychologically easier to bear false guilt than to bear powerless vulnerability As long as you are responsible you are in controlAnd in my case there was a third reason It was easier for me to bear responsibility than it was to bear the truth that a person of the clergy  a person I believed was entrusted by God to shepherd others  was capable of so great a violation and crimeMy story  and the stories of countless others who have been the victims of sexual assault perpetrated by pastors  is a story of how fairy tales have failed us The Brothers Grimm taught us that good and evil are visibly discernible Good is always beautiful and evil (excepting Snow Whites Evil Queen) is always ugly heroines are flawless while villains are deformed and grotesque But in the real world good and evil are not so nearly apparent as we might hopeAs Russian novelist Alexander Solzhenitsyn understood The line separating good and evil passes  right through every human heart  and through all human hearts Yet we are reluctant to admit that monsters do not look as they do in our fairy tales and myths they can look like us like our pastors the very people we believe God has entrusted to guide us The world would seem safer and more controllable if beasts were sequestered to the Forbidden Forest never lurking in our homes our workplaces and our pulpitsI wish this werent my story With it though I hope to make all the good I can My interest and vocational expertise in spiritual formation and leadership is not happenstance nor did it arise out of mere intellectual curiosity I write and teach on what it means for Christians especially those in authority to actually live and be like Jesus  through and through  so that maybe tomorrow there will be fewer people with stories like mineThe rape was the catalyst that changed the course of my life and if this man had been the type of person he claimed to be or if senior leadership had paid more attention to whom they let fill their pulpits it never would have happened My work is my way of fighting back my way of beating back the darkness now that I have strengthWhen Kelly Lisenbee checked Facebook on Sunday night she saw the same message repeated by many of her friends I didnt know he was going to forcibly kiss me she wrote in an updated post I didnt know he was going to put his hand in my jeans   I didnt know that after I pushed him away and told him no that he was going to tell all his buddies that it happened anyway  Stories like hers exploded across social media Sunday and Monday among women galvanized by the abuse and harassment allegations involving Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein On Twitter the #MeToo hashtag had beentweeted nearly half a million times as of Monday afternoon more than 600000 people were talking about it on Facebook Celebrities like Alyssa Milano and Rosario Dawson first helped to amplify the hashtag on Sunday afternoon as thousands of women shared that they were victims of harassment and assault Some contributed wrenching accounts of romantic overtures by bosses catcalls from strangers and sexual assault Others simply chose to write Me too offering no further detailsMe too  Rosario Dawson (@rosariodawson) For Lisenbee the online conversation was an epiphany No one talked about these things when she was growing up in Broken Arrow Okla she said now the messages on Facebook had her thinking about a connection between her assault and her subsequent struggles with her weightIm just so glad that were talking about it she said in an interview I hope that it saves the next generation of womenBut for other women the #MeToo discussion is feeling all too familiarLucia Lorenzi saw #MeToo and she immediately felt tired Anyone else feeling like theyre drowning in stories their own or others she tweetedA postdoctoralfellowliving in Vancouver Lorenzi noted that this is not the first time women have been sharing stories online of their mistreatment by men Before #MeToo there was #MyHarveyWeinstein Before that there were others #WhatWereYouWearing #YouOkSis and #SurvivorPrivilege each started by a woman of colorThe hashtags asked women who have experienced sexual harassment or assault to make themselves known to reveal a part of that storyAll these women she notes are taking on a portion of the work I wish they didnt have to do   so that society can become aware of the problem Lorenzi wrote to The Washington Post Society she argues should be plenty aware by nowWagatwe Wanjuki a social media specialist for Daily Kos who created the #SurvivorPrivilege hashtag a few years ago said she respects that many of her friends are feeling solidarity with the new campaign But I just knew it wouldnt be empowering for meSo Wanjuki decided to write her own post explaining why she  say me too One of her reasons I know deep down it wont do anything Men who need a certain threshold of survivors coming forward to get it will never get it More than 17000 people shared her postI wont say Me too Partially because most of you know that alreadyBut mostly because we shouldnt have to outPosted by  onAs a campaign to show the volume of women who have survived sexual harassment or assault #MeToo has succeeded The question is Will it actually change anythingLisenbee believes she is seeing things change at least in her own online communities and among the women she knows where topics like sexual assault and harassment had not been discussed this way before The conversations are happening thats a change she wrote to The Washington Post in a follow-up message If assaulters know that men/women will no longer suffer in silence it could deter assaultsAlso it could encourage those who have been assaulted to seek help  More importantly she added if this hashtag helps women relieve themselves of the burden of carrying this around then that is enoughFor Lorenzi #MeToo remains the latest of many hashtags that asks a lot of survivors without producing thegoals it seems to inspire in its participants But that doesnt mean its meaninglessIts easy in this line of work to be cynical about these kinds of hashtags and the swell of press they get for a week or two before another perpetrator is exposed and another hashtag takes off she said I guess my hope would be for those who are still choosing to blame survivors to ask themselves why this thing keeps happening like clockworkI dont think #MeToo signals some kind of watershed moment she added But I am hoping that it serves as another link in the chain to some concrete systemic changeThe

products pumped out by the worlds dominant steelmaking power ChinaOn the campaign trail Donald Trump blasted the North American Free Trade Agreement as the worst trade deal ever and threatened to rip it up And yet the North American economy is a vast interlocking web of enterprises that would not be easy to unravelMexican manufacturing has enjoyed a boom under NAFTA At the same time US farmers ship oceans of grain to Mexico Countless products like those nails result from manufacturing chains that straddle both countries American companies profit from the trade  Walmart is Mexicos biggest employer  and that helps to prop up Americans 401(k) accounts American-made parts that are assembled into cars in Mexico and sold back across the border mean fewer jobs in Detroit but cheaper cars for all AmericansIts not a one-sided thing said Sam Vale a McAllen Tex businessman who owns and operates a commercial bridge across the Rio Grande Is the American public willing to spend 30 to 40 percent more for an automobile just because these guys lost their jobsPresident-elect Trumps rejection of NAFTA has placed American manufacturing at a crossroads and caused alarm south of the border Trump has warned American companies against moving operations abroad and some have reversed plans to do so On Tuesday Carrier a manufacturer of air conditioners promised to keep nearly 1000 jobs in Indiana that had been intended for MexicoIf Trumps anti-free-trade convictions are carried into his presidency he could unravel the economic and geopolitical consensus that has guided relations in North America for the past quarter-century Economists and rattled business leaders say the return of tariffs would sledgehammer the border-crossing supply chains that have pushed bilateral trade to more than $500 billion a year potentially wiping out millions of jobs in both countriesMexico has made undeniable economic gains in the 22 years since the start of NAFTA A muscular new manufacturing belt of steel mills auto factories and electronics plants has arisen in the parched northern scrublands where workers earning $2 or $3 an hour make things that used to roll off assembly lines in Ohio Indiana and the factory towns of the American Rust BeltTrump triumphed in those states with the message that Americas losses were Mexicos gains vowing to avenge them with import tariffs and penalties on US companies that move jobs south He points to the $61 million trade  with Mexico as evidence that NAFTA is a loser for the American economyBut untangling the labyrinth of benefits profits and cost savings is not simple since so much cross-border commerce is driven by major US companies Business executives on both sides of the border cant quite think that a US president would tear up an agreement whose benefits to American corporations and consumers seem obviousIf you close the border for one day all the industry in the Midwest stops said economist Luis de la Calle who worked on NAFTAs implementation at Mexicos embassy in Washington The level of integration is much more profound than people think or than Trump imaginesMexicos economy is showing signs of stress from Trumps win The Mexican peso has lost nearly 10 percent of its value and a new report by Mexicos second-largest bank predicts the country will enter a recession if Trump follows through on his threats to scrap NAFTA which would scare away foreign investmentBut the potential pain to the US economy has received less attention Key sectors are powered by trade with Mexico Mexico is the second-largest destination for US exports and iconic American companies such as Caterpillar Ford and General Electric often send US-made components over the border to Mexico for assembly shipping back finished products duty-free The factories and manufacturing plants of northern Mexico are increasingly powered by natural gas piped in from TexasAccording to the US Chamber of Commerce 6 million American jobs depend on trade with Mexico and about 40 percent of Mexicos exports are made from US parts components and other inputsThis model has allowed American firms to compete and thrive sending their stock prices soaring while helping them fend off competition from European and Asian manufacturers that also outsource to assembly plants in China and other low-wage nations Although these high-end manufacturing jobs in Mexico pay less than in the United States they also act as a magnet keeping Mexicans from migrating to the United States Migration rates for Mexicans are at their lowest levels in decadesGlobalization has its shortcomings and problems I agree and we need to address them said Fernando Elizondo a top official in Mexicos industrial powerhouse state of Nuevo Leon But going back to a world of isolationism makes no sense Are we all going to live on farms again raising chickens and pigs More than a dozen US and Mexican companies that assemble or manufacture products in northern Mexico declined to respond to questions about the potential effects on their businesses from new trade barriers in what may be a sign of anxiety that Trump may follow through on his threatsCompany representatives who agreed to discuss the issue argued that technology and robotics are rapidly replacing US manufacturing jobs so trying to force companies to leave Mexico wouldnt restore American factories to their former glory Instead the breakdown of NAFTA probably would bring a trade war During his campaign Trump threatened to slap 35 percent tariffs on cars and auto parts imported from Mexico Mexico could quickly retaliate by raising tariffs of its ownAmerican companies find Mexico attractive because of low labor costs but also because of valuable incentive packages provided by Mexican authorities in tax breaks land and infrastructure Cardone an auto-parts manufacturer that was widely criticized for its plans to relocate a plant from Pennsylvania to northern Mexico said the move was needed to improve competitiveness in an industry where price sensitivity is critically important company executive George Zauflik said in a statementCardone is constantly seeking new ways to design and remanufacture auto parts that provide greater value for our customers As a result we are devoting significant investment dollars to innovation particularly on high-tech higher-wage engineering jobs almost all of which are in the US he said    In 2012 along a desolate expanse of creosote brush west of Monterrey the DeAcero company built a state-of-the-art $750 million steel mill The company melts down scrap metal to produce beams rebar and cables mostly for the Mexican construction industry But it also ships products such as barbed wire and fencing to the United StatesThe company acquired a nail manufacturing plant in Poplar Bluff Mo in 2012 and by sourcing its raw materials from Mexico it has remained competitive with the Chinese firms that dominate the US marketCompany executive Juan Antonio Reboulen said that if a Trump administration imposed new tariffs on the steel rods it ships north the 700 workers at plants in Missouri and Texas could lose their jobsThe United States would be shooting itself in the foot he saidOn the world stage Mexican firms see themselves as a natural partner for the United States in the larger competition with China which is expanding its trade and influence in the Western Hemisphere A week after Trumps win Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in South America with promises to double foreign investment in the region China accounts for half of the worlds steel production making eight times more than the United States and Mexico combined Chinas notorious dumping practices in which state-subsidized products are sold for export below cost is the real threat to US and Mexican producers  not NAFTA DeAceros executives sayThey want Trump to see Mexico as a partner not a rivalIf we dont join forces to strengthen North America we will be flooded with imports from China and Korea Reboulen saidIranian President Hassan Rouhani was reelected to a second term by a landslide the interior minister declared Saturday presenting him a resounding endorsement of his plans to end Irans pariah status and rejoin the global economy With 57 percent of the vote Rouhani defeated his hard-line rival Ebrahim Raisi who had the backing of the ruling clergy and allied security forces He also won a clear mandate to push through domestic reforms and pursue talks with the West building on the nuclear deal he negotiated with world powers That agreement which Rouhani and his cabinet clinched during his first term constrains Irans nuclear program in exchange for international sanctions relief The landslide victory gives Rouhani a mandate he did not have during his first term said Cliff Kupchan chairman of Eurasia Group a political risk firm Hell remain a centrist Kupchan said But will be more aggressive in pursuing reforms Rouhani and his reformist backers also dealt a devastating blow to Iranian conservatives most of whom supported Raisi and scoff at the soft power of the incumbent leaders diplomacy Turnout reached roughly 70 percent with about 40 million Iranians casting ballots nationwide Friday At stake was whether Iran would continue to open up to the world or return to the diplomatic and economic isolation of the past Raisi and his supporters appeared to favor policies associated with former president and populist firebrand Mahmoud Ahmadinejad It was under his leadership that the United Nations began sanctioning Iran for failing to halt its uranium enrichment program   But while Rouhani managed to remove sanctions economic growth remains slow and unemployment high Many Iranians still live in poverty and Raisi who heads Irans largest religious endowment seized on the discontent to appeal to the poor and run a populist campaign The effort though ultimately failed Despite poor economic conditions [Iranians] said no to populism and empty promises of government subsidies said Reza H Akbari a researcher on Iranian politics at the Institute for War and Peace Reporting This is especially refreshing given the recent rising populist trends in Europe and the US he said The Iranian system is far from fair and balanced However Iranians demonstrated their belief that the most effective path to reform is  through the ballot box Irans president commands the states vast bureaucracy and also has the ability to shape foreign and domestic policy But all matters of the state must eventually be approved by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Guardian Council a body of theocrats There were worries before the vote that Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guard Irans shadowy but most powerful security institution would rig the results to ensure a Raisi win In the 2009 election widespread suspicions of fraud led to a grass-roots protest movement by reformists against the state and then-president Ahmadinejad The demonstrations were brutally quashed and the opposition leaders  including Mir Hossein Mousavi his wife Zahra Rahnavard and Mehdi Karroubi  remain under house arrest Its very noteworthy that Khamenei did not force a Raisi win Kupchan said There has been speculation that Khamenei had chosen Raisi as his potential successor The erstwhile successor to the leader took a body blow tonight he said And the path to a more moderate successor to Khamenei is now at least somewhat clearer On the international front Iran will have to confront the more bellicose administration of President Trump As presidential vote in Iran took place Trump landed Saturday in Saudi Arabia which is Irans main rival His administration has placed the nuclear deal under interagency review and recently imposed new sanctions on Iran for its ballistic missile program   Still Rouhani has pledged to continue to negotiate with the United States to persuade them to lift non-nuclear sanctions Despite the tensions Rouhani sees Iran as benefiting from the West and from foreign investment And apparently Iranian voters agree Iranian voters sent a resounding message to the Trump administration Akbari said They are committed to the path of diplomacy and moderation They stand behind Rouhanis attempts to break the countrys isolationAt home Rouhani will probably struggle with more progressive political reform He has failed to secure the release of Mousavi Rahnavard and Karroubi from house arrest Iran enjoys greater access to social media and the Internet and reformist publications and Facebook pages flourished But activists and journalists are still detained and jailed Even with his strong mandate it is unclear how much he will be able to achieveRouhani will continue to face an uphill climb on political reform Kupchan said According to Akbari The moderate and reformist elements within the society are fully aware of Rouhanis shortcomings when it comes to human rights and guaranteeing social freedoms However they decided to give him a second chance to deliver on his promises he saidThe teenagerhad been selling herself for moneysince she was 12 She had been exploited by pimps she says and was in the act of running away from one when she met Brendan OBrien a police officer in Oakland CalifBut instead of helping the then-17-year-old prostitute OBrien and more than 30otherlaw enforcement officers continued to traffic rape victimize and exploit a teenage girl who needed to be rescued according to a legal claim filed with the Oakland city attorneys office Instead of helping [the teen] find a way out of exploitation they furthered and deepened her spiral down into the sex trade the claim addsNow 19 the teen is seeking $66 million in damages from the city its police force its former chief and multiple officers  the latest twist in an astonishing sex scandal that has swept up several police departments in the San Francisco Bay areaThe scandal led to the resignation ofOaklands police chief as well as the two people appointed to replace him neither of whom lasted a week It also   and an apology from OaklandMayor Libby SchaafI am deeply sorry for the harm that this scandal has caused particularly to community trust which for many was already so tenuous Schaaf (D) said earlier this monthThe teens claim filed Friday implicates not just OBrien and the officers accused of having sex with the teen but also supervisors who stood by with a blind eye as the teenbecameasex slave for the officers her attorneys saidOBrien committed suicide in the midst of a growing internal investigationA note he left behind named other officers who he said had sex with the teen Investigators have moved ahead with their case against 10 officers  seven were charged last month another three this week Prosecutors say more charges are comingAnd leaders inOakland and other municipalities have said they are cleaning houseI am here to run a police department not a frat house Schaaf said in June  She vowed to root out what is clearly a toxic macho culture the Times reportedSchaaf did not respond to messages seeking comment this week  The teensattorneys say theres something systemically wrong with the departments involvedIts hard to imagine a situation where this happenswhere you bring in so many cops doing things of this nature and you dont have some fundamental breakdown in the department the teensattorney A Cabral Bonner told The Washington Post Its a cultural thingBonner said the attorneys are asking for approximately $6 million for each Oakland officer accused of having sexual contact with the teen and less for supervisors who knew about the activity but didnt report itThe officers their superiors and other civicemployees either directly engaged in stood by with a blind eye or acted to cover up this modern-day slavery  in order to engage in sexual acts with her while she was a minor the claim statesThe claim was filed in the teens name but The Post generally does not identify victims of sexual assaultRevelations about herrelationship with the police departments first came to light over the summer In all she says she had sex with more than around the Bay Area Many didnt pay her but instead tipped her off to prostitution stings keeping her on the streets she saysShealso claims she had sex with several officers while she was underageThe officers told each other about her and an additional 15 engaged in sex-related online chatting with her she saidA few of the officers paid her she said while some of the others abused their authority tipping her to anti-prostitution stings or running names of people she was curious about through confidential databases One Oakland officer she said had sex with her at a hotel near the Oakland airport in February then texted her later in the morning to warn of an undercover stingTheir perks become your perks [the teen] said They have resources They can run things for you They can find out s about anybody If they can find out s about anybody I can find out s about anybody  The claim seeking $66 million was filed after the teen spent two weeks in jail for biting asecurity guard during an altercation at a rehabilitation facility in FloridaEven her time at that facility sparked controversy The teenwas sent there  by the police department in Richmond just north of OaklandThat department is alsoembroiled in the sex scandalFive of the officers the teen claimed she had sex with were from the police force there including one who was a lieutenant On Aug 26 Richmond police helped the teenagercheckinto a rehabilitation center more than 2500 miles from her home using taxpayer money from the California Victims Compensation FundProsecutors in Northern

Police DepartmentsreputationRight in the heart of the investigation when charges are imminent when a witness is required shes sent to rehab Bonner her attorney said this week It just doesnt make a whole lot of sense to pick the place the furthest away from where she lives Even then it shouldbe a facility shes free to leave  and then she ends up in a situation where shes arrestedThree days into her rehab stint the teenwasaccused of attacking security officers According to a policereportthe teenremoved her shirt and bra and began flashing motorists passing outside the rehab facility A worker got her to come inside but the situation only escalatedThe workers were afraid [she] was going to become violent according to the report which said she balled up her fists At one point she tried to pull down acountertop safe and had to be restrainedWhen the security officers intervened [she] began resisting starting a physical altercation While standing in the room [she] began screaming at the employees then lunged at one of the female security officersHer father that the rehab center staff wouldnt let her use a phone to call her parents That he said is what sparked the latest incident that landed her in jailShe ultimately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor batterycharge in FloridaWhen she was released from jail one of her other attorneys said the teen had beensystematically victimized by police agenciesIf we allow her to become victimized by law enforcement or to be used or abused or tricked then every child on the street that is facing the same kind of life that is trapped in a web of sexual assault and sexual abuse wouldknow that you cannot come forward PamelaPrice told reportersBonner whose Northern California law firm filed the claim against the city of Oakland also sought to defend the teens reputation after several news organizations publishedracy photos of herand highlighted the young womans lifestyleIf youre talking about whethera 16-year-old girl is impressionable and can make a poor decision well obviously she can Bonner said But you have adult men who have a legal responsibility tomake the right decision but dontWith the kind of fanfare that only a totalitarian state can muster North Korea on Saturday flaunted missiles that can theoretically reach the United States and defiantly stated that it was prepared to counter any US attack with a nuclear war of our ownBut it soon looked like a case of style over substance North Korea somewhat ruined the impression created with the parade which took place on the most important day of the year for Kim Jong Uns regime with a failed missile launch Sunday morningThe ballistic missile was fired from the Sinpo area on the east coast shortly before 6am local time US Pacific Command said Itblew up almost immediately complicating efforts to identify the missiles size and range North Korea fired a land-based version of its medium-range submarine-launched ballistic missile from the same areaearlier this monthThat exercise also failedThe missile was fired as Vice President Mike Pence took off from Alaska on his way to Seoul where he is expected to issue a strong warning to North Korea to stop its provocative behavior or face consequencesWe werent surprised by it we were anticipating it a White House foreign policy adviser told reporters traveling with Pence It wasnt a matter of if it was a matter of when The good news is that after five seconds it fizzled outAs a result the US doesnt need to expend any resources against that he saidPence had been in contact with President Trump while he was traveling to Asia As tensions with North Korea escalated heading into the weekend Trump spent Friday and Saturday mornings golfing at his private club in West Palm Beach Fla greeting members after he returned from the green according to someone who saw himThe president seemed to be hoping for a calm weekend He was joined on his trip by just three junior staffers and KT McFarland a deputy national security adviser who was recently pushed out and made ambassador to Singapore as a consolation Many of Trumps White House aides were given the weekend off Trump had nothing to say about the launch said Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis The president and his military team are aware of North Koreas most recent unsuccessful missile launch Mattis said in a statement The president has no further commentThe missile was launched into the sea off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula where a US Navy strike group is patrolling Military commanders ordered the group led by the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinsonto the area this month as tensions with North Korea mountedThe group has the ability to shoot down incoming missiles and launch missiles of its own Although the missile in Sundays attempt  like others before it  exploded shortly after launch experts warn that North Koreas rocket scientists learn something from failures as well as successes giving them information they can use to hone their technology Certainlythe military hardware paraded through Pyongyang on Saturday shows that Kim is unrelenting in his quest to develop a missile capable of reaching the United StatesExperts were stunned at the sheer number of new missiles on display during the parade  including apparently a new and previously unknown type of intercontinental ballistic missileIts not like not doing a nuclear test was good news  this is all part of the same program said Jeffrey Lewis head of the East Asia program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California North Korea has claimed to be able to make nuclear weapons small enough to be able to fit on a missileIts like theyre saying Hey heres some other bad news Lewis saidThe two-hour-long parade took place on a day officially known as the the anniversary of the 1912 birth of Kim Il Sung North Koreas founder and the current leaders grandfatherA relaxed Kim Jong Un stood smiling on a balcony as untold tens of thousands of soldiers marched past planes in a formation making 105  for the anniversary  flew overhead and missile transporters rolled through the square in front of himHe did not look like a man worried about a strike ordered by Trump like that in Syria earlier this month or concerned about Chinas increasing anger over his belligerence  We will respond to an all-out war with an all-out war and a nuclear war of our own Choe Ryong Hae one of Kims top aides said in a speech at the parade as the 33-year-old leader looked onKim said in his New Years address that North Korea was in the final stage of preparations to test-launch an intercontinental ballistic missile or ICBM That prompted Trump to tweet in response It wont happenBut Kim appeared to demonstrate Saturday that he is in the process of making it happenNorth Korea has previously shown off at these parades two kinds of ICBMs the KN-08 and the KN-14 both with the theoretical capacity to reach the US mainlandSaturdays parade included the same vehicles as in the past but instead of carrying missiles they were carrying huge previously unseen missile canisters Those could have contained the KN-08 and KN-14 or something else  or nothing at allBut the message was clearThis was a promise of future capabilities more than a demonstration of existing missiles said Joe Cirincione president of the Ploughshares Fund which tries to stop the spread of nuclear weapons We do not know if there is actually an ICBM in that canister But it is certainly comingFurthermore the canisters are probably an indication that North Korea is pressing ahead with solid-fuel technology because canisters are used to keep the temperature stable for solid-fuel missiles  By using North Korea can roll out its missiles from a hangar or tunnel ready to launch rather than having to fuel them on a gantry like the older liquid-fueled rockets That allows much less time for the missiles to be detected by satellitesNorth Korea has been using this technology for its submarine-launched ballistic missile which Kim boasted was the greatest success and the land-based variant tested earlier this month but less successfully Both types of missiles were displayed in the parade SaturdayIn addition although experts were continuing to analyze footage it appeared that North Korea had shown off a third and previously unknown ICBMThemissiles looked like KN-08s but were slightly smaller They were rolled out on vehicles usually used for the medium-range Musudan missileIn January South Koreas Yonhap News Agency reported citing military officials that North Korea had probably built a new ICBM that was less than 50 feet long The black-and-white missile seen Saturday was consistent with that description experts saidBut rather than being concerned that North Korea potentially had a new weapon that could reach the United States Michael Elleman senior fellow for missile defense at the International Institute for Strategic Studies saw something encouragingThis could signal some confusion in terms of where they want to go with their long-range systems he said noting that it could mean North Korea has not finalized the design of its ICBM  Elleman said he could not believe that North Korea had been able to master the technology necessary to launch even one stage of a two- or three-stage ICBMUntil theyve fixed the Musudan theyre not going to get anywhere he said North Korea has never launched an ICBM but given how difficult the technology is it would almost certainly fail on its first test experts sayMarkus Schiller a German aerospace engineer who specializes in missiles also cast doubts on how much progress North Korea was makingThe Soviets tried to build a solid-fuel missile and it took them more than 15 years to get it up and running he said You dont just get a solid-fuel missile overnightBut even if North Korea does not yet have the technical capacity to launch a missile capable of reaching the United States it has clearly demonstrated that it has the political willIts alarming that they are pouring so much money and resources into this program Elleman said Eventually they are going to be successful Ashley Parker in West Palm Beach Fla contributed to this reportNew Yorks mayor and police commissioner ripped Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Friday for a Justice Department statement declaring that their city was soft on crime and plagued by gang murdersThe war of words arose from an ongoing dispute between the Trump administration and many large US cities over immigration policy but Fridays fireworks were remarkable in that the leader of the largest police force in the country publicly denounced the attorney general the nations top law enforcement officialThe Justice Department  in threatening to withhold millions of dollars in grant money from the New York Police Department if the city doesnt change its policy and turn over suspected illegal immigrants in custody to immigration agents  said in a news release that New York continues to see gang murder after gang murder the predictable consequence of the citys soft on crime stanceMany of these jurisdictions are also crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime the news release said  New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) called that statement outrageous given the citys record-low crime figures which are part of a decades-long trend in falling crime that began in the early 1990sAttorney General Sessions is supposed to be the leading law enforcement official in America he said Why would he insult the men and women who do this work every day put their lives on the line in order to achieve so much I would say to President Trump and to Attorney General Sessions if you believe this statement is accurate come here to New York City look our police officers in the eye and tell them that you believe they are soft on crime See how that feels See what the people of New York City will say about thatNew York Police Commissioner James ONeill called the Justice Departments criticism incredibly insulting and said there are piles of data to prove that the city is anything but soft on crimeWhen I

added and neither is New YorkLater though he heaped praise on the city for policies that had reduced crime and said officials merely had to be careful in altering those highly successful policiesI would say this about New York New York has done some great things in criminal justice they are following policies that have proven to reduce crime in America Sessions said We have a disagreement with the mayor over sanctuary city policies I strongly disagree with his ideas on thatStatement from Police Commissioner James P ONeillWatch media briefing   NYPD NEWS (@NYPDnews) Around the same time the Justice Department issued a second statement saying it was making a distinction between New York Citys policies and the work of the NYPDUnfortunately the Mayors policies are hamstringing the brave NYPD officers that protect the city and only serve to endanger the lives of the hard working men and women of the NYPD who care more about keeping their city and country safe than they do about city hall politics the statement saidNew York of course was not the only place to find itself at odds with SessionsCalifornia Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Len (D) said that Sessionswas basing his enforcement policieson principles of white supremacy New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu (D) quipped that if the administration would actually do some research before firing off threats it would have seen there was no need to target New OrleansThe Republican National Convention opens in Cleveland    in exactly 16 daysThat means that sometime over the next two weeks or so well find out whom Trump has picked to be his vice-presidential running mate Trump and his team have said all sorts of things about the timing of the announcement including sometime soon and in the midst of the conventionEither way its coming And coming soonTrying to figure out a) whom Trump will pick or b) whom he is consulting in deciding whom to pick is well tough But we do have some insight into where we stand in the process thanks to my WaPo colleagues Bob Costa and Karen Tumulty Donald Trumps campaign has begun formally vetting possible running mates with former House speaker Newt Gingrich emerging as the leading candidate followed by New Jersey Gov Chris Christie  Gingrich and Christie have been asked to submit documents and are being cast as favorites for the post inside the campaignThat all makes sense and is in keeping with the general criteria  political experience but with a willingness to speak out against political correctness  that Trump has laid out when talking about picking his vice president Both Christie and Gingrich fit that bill They also meet another important criteria for Trump Theyre willing to take the second-in-command slot if offered Both men have no obvious next political step beyond this election an end-of-the-line mentality that would lead them to sign on with the unpredictable real estate mogulTaking the Trump team at itsword  gulp  Gingrich and Christie occupy the top two spots in our new rankings of the Republican veepstakes Heres who else makes the top 5If immigration is at the heart of Trumps campaign  and it is  then picking the senator from Alabama makes some sense Sessions has been the leading voice of hard-line conservatives on immigration for quite some time and found common cause with Trump on the issue even becoming the first senator to endorse Trump During a news conference in late May  Selecting Sessions would barely move the needle nationally however since Sessions isnt broadly known and comes from a part of the country where swing states are few and far betweenThe Oklahoma governor has much to recommend her She has spent time in office in Washington (she served in the House) and outside of it (she was elected governor in 2010) and perhaps most importantly she is a prominent female conservative Trump has major problems among female voters  an issue that Hillary Clinton and her campaign have already been moving to exploit  about the job but that doesnt mean much since her people could have provided all the information the nominees team needed to vet herThe Indiana governor is headed to New York City this weekend to meet with Trump and is being formally vetted  Pence is a bit of a late arrival to the veepstakes as his name has only emerged publicly this week He does make a lot of sense for Trump however Pence is someone with strong ties to social conservatives a voting bloc Trump continues to struggle to attract and has spent time not only in Congress but also as a member of GOP leadership Pence is also telegenic and a gifted communicator who hails from the part of the country  the upper Midwest  that Trump badly needs to make competitiveNo one has sacrificed more for Trump than the New Jersey governor His decision to endorse Trump in the heat of the primary process cost him dearly within the political establishment  even among those who called themselves his allies Christie has been by Trumps side more than any other politician and according to reporting on their relationship is one of the few people who has the presumptive Republican presidential nominees ear And Christies reputation for clashing with the media his own party and of course Democrats will surely remind Trump of himself Does Christie have the Washington know-how that Trump wantsYou can see why the former House speaker is appealing to Trump He wakes up in the morning with 10 new policy ideas he has spent time at the heights of Washington and he loves nothing more than upending the alleged wisdom of the political elites Gingrichs weaknesses are similar to Trumps  he veers off message often his personal life has been complicated and his ego is well massive  but Gingrichs recent decision to change his position on trade    suggests he knows hes very much in the running and wants to make clear he very much wants the jobThePhiladelphia Eagles and  humbled the Washington Redskins on Monday night pushing their record to a league-leading 6-1 and giving them a three-game lead in the NFC East and the top spot in this weeks power rankingsThere is bound to be some argument centered around the next four or five spots especially with the Kansas City Chiefs losers of two straight at No 2 Allow me to explainThese power rankings alsotake into account a teams actual record what their record should be based on points scored and allowed  also known as theirand how much better or worse theiropponents are in relation to a500 team A good team playing against good opponents will be near the top while those who struggle against mediocre or poor teams will trend toward the bottomThe Chiefs therefore are benefiting from early season success outscoring opponents by 114 points per game after adjusting for strength of schedule One of those opponents is the Eagles who lost to Kansas City 27-20 in Week 2 The Chiefs also have a quality win against the 5-2 Patriots withone of their two losses against the 5-2 Pittsburgh Steelers which doesnt look bad considering it was a six-point defeatAcan be found in the Week 1 rankings Disagree with any of the rankings Remember when the Atlanta Falcons were good You should  they were in the Super Bowl a few months ago and started this season 3-0 Since then however they are underwhelming Much of their offensive woes can be traced to their  Quarterback Matt Ryan averaged 104 net yards per pass on first downs last season but is producing just 77 net passing yards on first down in 2017 Atlantas offensive line is allowing slightly more pressures this season (26 percent of passing plays in 2017 24 percent in 2016) but not enough to justify such a big drop Instead point the finger at Ryan for the Falcons scoring almost five fewer points per game on first downs this season  The San Francisco 49ers andCleveland Browns are both winless but also better than their record suggests with point differentials of minus-63 and minus-66 respectively From 2002 the year the NFL expanded to 32 teams to 2016 there have been with a point differential as bad or worse than they have over the first seven games of the seasononly 13didnt win a single game during that span Almost half (23) won two or more contests  The offensive line is dealing with injuries to left tackle Trent Williams right guard Brandon Scherff right tackle Morgan Mosesand tackle Ty Nsekhe Thats going to put quarterback Kirk Cousins under more pressure than usual which in turn reduces his passer rating from a league-leading 1265 in a clean pocket to a mere 628 in the face of a pass rush The Broncos might be able  but Kansas Citys passing game should be able to rack up some yards  and points  against a secondary that is allowing an     If the Falcons couldnt move the ball much through the air against the Patriots the third-worst pass defense in the NFL what hope do they have against the Jets who rank No 19 for net yards allowed per attemptNew York is also stingy when it comes to receivers gaining yards in the open field  the Jets have allowed a league-low 32 yards after the catch per reception this season making it tougher for Falcons QB Matt Ryan and elite wideout Julio Jones toget the offense back on track|  | Their names made the biggest noninjury headlines of the week in the NFL and this week one is expected to continue to play a big role for his team while the other is likely to be a backup for a whileThanks to  the Dallas Cowboys will have the services of running back Ezekiel Elliottwhen they play the Kansas City Chiefs in AT&T Stadium in an important game for the 4-3 team as it chasesthe Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC East For the third time a federal court intervened Friday to keep Elliott who is fighting a six-game suspension eligible granting a request by the NFL Players Association to keep the suspension on hold while the union appeals a ruling MondayIts a risky gambit by the Cowboys who could lose Elliott at a critical stretch of the season if all legal means are exhausted but his recent productivity shows just how valuable he is Over the last three games he has rushed for 413 yards with 150 coming last week in a victory over the RedskinsFor the Cowboys having Elliott against the Chiefs who struggle to stop the run is a big plus For the Chiefs well they have Alex Smith who hasnt thrown an interception yet this seasonIn San Francisco the 49ers will try for the ninth time this season to win a game and while Jimmy Garoppolo drew all the attention when the team sent a second-round draft pick for him to New England for him ahead of Tuesdays trade deadline Garoppolo long Tom Bradys understudy will be active for the game against the Arizona Cardinals but so will starter CJ Beathard Garoppolo hasnt had much time to learn Kyle Shanahans offense but theres a chance his education will come under fire because Beathard may have taken 34 percent of the teams snaps but hes absorbed 41 percent of the sacks the team has given up and has been hit hard another half-dozen timesShanahan admitted that getting Garoppolo ready is a challenge  both for him and the team I dont care who you are or how many hours you put in theres no way you can get it all down in that short amount of time If he does get the opportunity to go in you got to scale it down You have to wristband a bunch of stuff  You got to be very selective in what you call and make sure he understands what youre doing Its not just the pass plays Its the snap count the cadence how to get out of the huddle where the run plays are going the ballhandling and all the little things that people take for granted that take a lot of time to work on Weve got in enough this week so that we know we can survive to a degree if he had to come in The 7-1 Philadelphia Eagles added a running back to a roster that also includes LeGarrette Blount obtaining Jay Ajayi from the Miami Dolphins Ajayi is expected to play in limited action against the 3-4 Denver Broncos in Philly but the key thing is that Carson Wentz is having an MVP-caliber season Hell be tested by the Broncos defense On offense theyll have a familiarface trying to end their losing streak at three games Brock Osweiler a second-round pick by the Broncos in 2012 started seven games for them in 2015 then signed with Houston as a free agent in 16 He later was traded to Cleveland in

trey wingo (@wingoz) In the Sunday night game Marshawn Lynch will be back for the 3-5 Oakland Raiders Theyll face a Dolphins team that is now minus Ajayi which will be a blessing for a run defense that iscoming off its worst showing of the season (allowing 151 rushing yards and a 48-yard rushing touchdown to Buffalos LeSean McCoy) Before that the Raiders hadnt allowed a 100-yard rusher through seven games The 4-3 Dolphins are averaging only 176 yards per game in the air but theyll have Jay Cutler and his sore ribs back after missing last weeks 40-0 loss to BaltimoreIn an early game the 5-3

and 2007 Giants have done Both went on to win the Super BowlEvery week the question arises Are the Los Angeles Rams for real Well theyre 5-2 and they journey east to play the woeful 1-6 New York Giants The Rams are 303 points per game which is second best to the Texans in the NFL A year ago they averaged 14 points last in the league For the Giants Eli Manning needs only 186 yards passing to

of the most congenial calls for the new commander in chief  a conversation with the leader of Australia one of Americas staunchest allies at the end of a triumphant weekInstead President Trump blasted Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over a refugee agreement and boasted about the magnitude of his electoral college win according to senior US officials briefed on the Saturday exchange Then 25minutes into what was expected to be an hour-long call Trump abruptly ended itAt one point Trump informed Turnbull that he had spoken with four other world leaders that day  including Russian President Vladimir Putin  and that this was the worst call by far  Trumps behavior suggests that he is capable of subjecting world leaders including close allies to a version of the vitriol he frequently employs against political adversaries and news organizations in speeches and This is the worst deal ever Trump fumed as Turnbull attempted to confirm that the United States would honor  from an Australian detention centerTrump who one day earlier had signed an executive order temporarily barring the admission of refugees complained that he was going to get killed politically and accused Australia of seeking to export the next Boston bombersTrump returned to the topic late Wednesday night writing in a message on Twitter Do you believe it The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia Why I will study this dumb deal  US officials said that Trump has behaved similarly in conversations with leaders of other countries including Mexico But his treatment of Turnbull was particularly striking because of the tight bond between the United States and Australia  countries that share intelligence support one another diplomatically and have fought together in wars including in Iraq and AfghanistanThe characterizations provide insight into Trumps temperament and approach to the diplomatic requirements of his job as the nations chief executive a role in which he continues to employ both the uncompromising negotiating tactics he honed as a real estate developer and the bombastic style he exhibited as a reality television personalityThe depictions of Trumps calls are also at odds with sanitized White House accounts The official readout of his conversation with Turnbull for example said that the two had emphasized the enduring strength and closeness of the US-Australia relationship that is critical for peace stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globallyA White House spokesman declined to comment A senior administration official acknowledged that the conversation with Turnbull had been hostile and charged but emphasized that most of Trumps calls with foreign leaders  including the heads of Japan Germany France and Russia  have been productive and pleasantTrump also vented anger and touted his political accomplishments in a tense conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto officials said The two have sparred for months over Trumps vow  for construction of a border wall between the two countries a conflict that prompted Pea Nieto to cancel a planned meeting with TrumpEven in conversations marred by hostile exchanges Trump manages to work in references to his election accomplishments US officials said that he used his calls with Turnbull and Pea Nieto to mention his election win or the size of the crowd at his inauguration  One official said that it may be Trumps way of speaking about the mandate he has and why he has the backing for decisions he makes But Trump is also notoriously thin-skinned and has used platforms including social-media accounts meetings with lawmakers and even  to depict his victory as an achievement of historic proportions rather than a narrow outcome in which his opponent Hillary Clinton won the popular voteThe friction with Turnbull reflected Trumps anger over being bound by an agreement reached by the Obama administration to accept refugees from Australian detention sites even while Trump was issuing an executive order suspending such arrivals from elsewhere in the worldThe issue centers on a population of about 2500 people who sought asylum in Australia but were diverted to facilities off that countrys coast at Nauru and Manus Island in Papua New Guinea  prompted intervention from the United Nations and a pledge from the United States to accept about half of those refugees provided they passed US security screening  Many of the refugees came from Iran Iraq Sudan and Somalia countries listed in Trumps order temporarily barring their citizens from entry to the United States A special provision in the Trump order allows for exceptions to honor a preexisting international agreement a line that was inserted to cover the Australia dealBut US officials said that Trump continued to fume about the arrangement even after signing the order in a ceremony at the PentagonI dont want these people Trump said He repeatedly misstated the number of refugees called for in the agreement as 2000 rather than 1250 and told Turnbull that it was my intention to honor the agreement a phrase designed to leave the US president wiggle room to back out of the deal in the future according to a senior US officialBefore Trump tweeted about the agreement Wednesday night the US Embassy in Canberra had assured Australian reporters that the new administration intended to take the refugeesPresident Trumps decision to honour the refugee agreement has not changed an embassy spokesman had told the reporters according to an official in the Sydney consulate This was just reconfirmed to the State Department from the White House and on to this embassy at 1315 Canberra timeThe time the embassy said it was informed the deal was going ahead was 915 pm in Washington one hour and 40 minutes before Trump suggested in a tweet that it might not go aheadDuring the phone conversation Saturday Turnbull told Trump that to honor the agreement the United States would not have to accept all of the refugees but only to allow each through the normal vetting procedures At that Trump vowed to subject each refugee to extreme vetting the senior US official saidTrump was also skeptical because he did not see a specific advantage the United States would gain by honoring the deal officials saidTrumps position appears to reflect the transactional view he takes of relationships even when it comes to diplomatic ties with long-standing allies Australian troops have fought alongside US forces for decades and the country maintains close cooperation with Washington on trade and economic issuesAustralia is seen as such a trusted ally that it is one of only four countries that the United States includes in the Five Eyes arrangement for cooperation on espionage matters Members share extensively what their intelligence services gather and generally refrain from spying on one anotherThere also is a significant amount of tourism between the two countriesTrump made the call to Turnbull about 5pm Saturday from his desk in the Oval Office where he was joined by chief strategist Stephen K Bannon national security adviser Michael Flynn and White House press secretary Sean SpicerAt one point Turnbull suggested that the two leaders move on from their impasse over refugees to discuss the conflict in Syria and other pressing foreign issues But Trump demurred and ended the call making it far shorter than his conversations with Shinzo Abe of Japan Angela Merkel of Germany Franois Hollande of France or PutinThese conversations are conducted candidly frankly privately Turnbull said at a news conference Thursday in Australia If you see reports of them Im not going to add to them A Odysseus Patrick in Sydney contributed to this reportNorth Korea sharply raised the stakes Sunday in its standoff with the rest of the world detonating a powerful nuclear device that it claimed was a hydrogen bombthat could be attached to a missile capable of reaching the mainland United StatesEven ifs regime is exaggerating its feats scientific evidence showed that North Korea had crossed an important threshold and had detonated a nuclear device that was vastly more powerful than its last  and almost seven times the size of the bomb that destroyed HiroshimaTensions had already been running high with Kim repeatedly defying international condemnation and increasingly blunt warnings by President Trump and continuing to launchballistic missilesBut Sundays blast  North Koreas sixth nuclear test but the first since Trump took office  could escalate those tensions to a new level Trump sharply condemned the test saying North Korea is very hostile and dangerous to the United StatesIn a pair of tweets issued Sunday morning Trump wrote North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States  North Korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China which is trying to help but with little successTrump also delivered an admonishment of sorts to South Korea saying that appeasement with North Korea will not work and suggesting that more severe steps must be taken to influence Kims regimeChina said Sunday that it resolutely opposes and strongly condemns the launch adding to denunciations from South Korea and JapanThe nuclear device that North Korea tested appeared to be so large that Vipin Narang an expert on nuclear proliferation and strategy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology called it a city busterNow with even relatively inaccurate intercontinental ballistic missile technology they can destroy the better part of a city with this yield Narang said  The nuclear test took place at exactly noon local time at North Koreas Punggye-ri testing site and was recorded as a according to the US Geological Survey It was followed eight minutes later by a 41-magnitude earthquake that appeared to be a tunnel collapsing at the siteJapan immediately sent up sniffer planes to try to measure radiation levelsNorth Korean state media said the test was carried to determine the accuracy and credibility of its H-bomb to be placed at the payload of the ICBM North Korea tested its intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time in July and its showed that the rocket could theoretically reach Denver or ChicagoThose launches caused Trump to warn that if North Korea continued its provocations itwould facefire and fury He later tweeted that the US military was locked and loadedNorth Korean television on Sunday broadcast footage of Kim signing the order to detonate Sundays test part of the regimes plan for building a strategic nuclear force was a perfect success the state-run Korean Central News Agency saidEarlier Sunday KCNA had released photos of Kim inspecting what was described as a hydrogen bomb that could be attached to an ICBM the same device that appeared to have been detonated just hours laterAll the components of the H-bomb were homemade so North Korea could produce powerful nuclear weapons as many as it wants the KCNA quoted Kim as saying  Analysts were poring over the photos and the data Sunday especially questioning North Koreas claim to have produced a two-stage thermonuclear weaponDavid Albright a nuclear weapons expert and president of the Institute for Science and International Security was skeptical of North Koreas claims and said the photos were probably propagandaBut there was no doubt that North Korea was making progress South Korean officials and independent nuclear scientists estimated the yield  the amount of energy released by the weapon  to be 100 kilotons That would make it almost seven times as strong as the US atomic bomb that destroyed the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945At that level North Koreas nuclear device would be very significant and destabilizing Albright said It would show that their design whatever the specific design has achieved a yield that is capable of destroying substantial parts of large modern citiesSouth Koreas meteorological agency said Sundays explosion was as much as six times the size of the fifth test in September last year and 11 times the size of the January 2016 detonationStill Albright doubted that North Korea had been able to make such a warhead small enough to fit onto a missileAfter firing increasingly long-range missiles including the two that can theoretically reach the US mainland into the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan North Korea last week and into the Pacific Ocean claiming it was capable of reaching Guam a US territoryAnalysts said that appeared to be a dummy run for firing an ICBM on a normal trajectory over Japan and into the Pacific instead of straight up and straight down as with its first two testsAlthough governments and experts would continue to assess the technical aspects of the latest nuclear test MITs Narang saidthe danger is significant regardless of whether this was a lesser boosted fission device or a true hydrogen bomb or whether North Korea had mastered the technology to deliver this accurately to a targetIt really doesnt matter now from a deterrence perspective he said Mated on the ICBM you dont want this thing anywhere near a city near you  Sundays test caused anger across the region with South Korean President saying he would never allow North Korea to continue advancing its nuclear and missile technologies according to his national security adviserSouth Korean military leaders warned North Korea that they together with their American allies were fully equipped to punish North KoreaBut Trump later admonished the Moon governmentSouth Korea is finding as I have told them that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work they only understand one thing he wrote in a third Sunday morning tweetJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he would not tolerate the nuclear test Abe had spoken with Trump three hours before the test and said afterward that they had agreed to increase pressure on North Korea and make it change its policiesThe White House said the two leaders discussed ongoing efforts to maximize pressure on North Korea Trump made the call fromAir Force One as he returned home to Washington from his visit to storm-battered Texas and LouisianaThe two leaders reaffirmed the importance of close cooperation between the United States Japan and South Korea in the face of the growing threat from North Korea the White House statement saidAll eyes will turn to China to see whether it will be angry enough to impose true punishment on North KoreaChina has expressed annoyance at North Koreas frequent ballistic missile launches but analysts have said that Beijing probably would not take serious action unless there is another nuclear testChinas primary concern isstability on its borders and it has shied away from implementing sanctions that would seriously undermine the regime in Pyongyang analysts have said Almost all international sanctions such as recent bans on coal and seafood exports rely on Chinese enforcement because about 90 percent of North Korean trade goes through ChinaChinas Foreign Ministry said Sunday that North Korea had conducted the nuclear test with no regard to the general objections of the international communityThe Chinese government resolutely opposes and strongly condemns this the ministryChina will work together with the international community to comprehensively and completely implement the relevant resolutions of the Security Council of the UN unswervingly push forward the denuclearization of the peninsula and unswervingly maintain the peace and stability of the peninsula it said Philip Rucker in Washington Yoonjung Seo in Seoul and Emily Rauhala and Shirley Feng in Beijing contributed to this reportNorth Korea threatened on Monday to shoot down US military planes even if they are not in the countrys airspace arguing that President Trumps bellicose tweets amount to a declaration of warThe remark by Ri Yong Ho Pyongyangs foreign minister represented another escalation in tensions stoked by a series of insults and threats hurled between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his regime Even though Pyongyangs military capability is considered far outmatched by US technology and pilot training Ris rhetoric raised anxieties that a simple miscalculation could spark a military confrontation and spiral out of controlFiery talk can lead to fatal misunderstandings said Stphane Dujarric spokesman for UN Secretary General Antnio GuterresLast week at the UN General Assembly Ri revealed that his country is considering testing a hydrogen bomb somewhere over the Pacific Ocean On Monday he made a more direct threat against the United States which Pyongyang considers its archenemy bent on destroying the regimeThe whole world should clearly remember it was the US who first declared war on our country said Ri speaking to reporters in New York in reference to Trumps comments at the General Assembly last week and Since the United States declared war on our country we will have every right to make countermeasures including the right to shoot down United States strategic bombers even when they are not inside the airspace border of our countryThe question of who wont be around much longer will be answered then Ri added responding to Trumps  warning that if Ri echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man they wont be around much longer Trump has repeatedly used the belittling epithet for Kim Jong Un  North Koreas willingness to shoot down US aircraft is not in question It has done so before most notably in 1969 during the Nixon administration when a Navy plane on a reconnaissance mission was downed by North Korean MiGs over the Sea of Japan or East Sea All 31 Americans on board were killed There was no retaliation and the United States resumed reconnaissance flights off the coast of North Korea a week laterThe United States and North Korea which have technically remained in a suspended state of war since the 1953 armistice have had other saber-rattling standoffsIn 1976 for example North Korean soldiers axed to death two US service members who ventured into the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea leading President Gerald R Ford to put all US troops in South Korea on the highest level of military readinessIn 1981 a North Korean surface-to-air missile was fired at a US reconnaissance plane flying near the DMZ but it missedIt is unknown whether North Korea has the ability to challenge the US Air Force today Most of its surface-to-air missiles and fighter planes are decades old many dating to the 1950s and 1960s when they were acquired from the Soviet UnionIf there is a war South Korean and US military pilots will soon become aces as they shoot down North Korean aircraft said David Maxwell a retired Army Special Forces colonel who served in Korea and now is associate director of the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown University The North Korean air force is no match for themEven as a threat lacking the might to back it up however Ris comments underscore the urgency behind the growing crisis over North Korea After many of its 2016 missile launches failed Pyongyang has in recent months accelerated its testing of medium-range and long-range missiles and has detonated what it claims was a hydrogen bomb The speed of the North Korean advances surprised even many military analystsNorth Korea is not believed to possess more-advanced surface-to-air missile systems such as the Russian S300s and S400s unless they were acquired clandestinelyIts hard to be sure what they have said Dean Cheng an Asia expert with the Heritage Foundation Theyre not necessarily going to parade them through PyongyangArmy Col Robert Manning III a Pentagon spokesman said Monday that North Koreas threat to shoot down American warplanes will not change US military operations US bomber flights conducted this weekend off the Korean Peninsulas east coast occurred in international airspace where the Pentagon has a right to fly he saidThe White House rejected Ris characterization that the two countries are in a state of open warWeve not declared war on North Korea said press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders And frankly the suggestion of that is absurdSanders said it is never appropriate to shoot down another countrys aircraft when flying in international airspaceOur goal is still the same she added We continue to seek the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula Thats our focus doing that through both the most maximum economic and diplomatic pressures as possible at this pointMany experts are concerned that tensions are being inflamed by the warlike rhetoric between North Koreas leadership and Trump starting with his combative address to the General Assembly last week in which he said the United States was ready willing and able to  North KoreaThe United States has great strength and patience but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea Trump saidSince then the hostile comments have flown back and forth almost daily with Kim calling Trump a mentally deranged US dotard and Trump gleefully repeating the Little Rocket Man put-downOn Saturday Ri said that Trumps mockery of Kim made it inevitable that rockets would visit the US mainland while North Korea released  showing North Korean missiles shooting down US planes and scoring a direct hit on an aircraft carrierMany experts dismiss the North Korean threats at least for nowThey do an excellent job of trying to deter by bluster said Bruce Bennett a North Korea expert with the Rand Corp a research organization Theyve been very successful convincing a lot of people its too dangerous to take them on when theyre such a weak country militarily in many waysBut with the chances for a military confrontation growing North Korea is proving it cannot be dismissed for longWe should absolutely take them seriously said Cheng of the Heritage Foundation North Korea has demonstrated its willingness to use force against South Korean sailors soldiers and civilians So its very difficult to predict what it would or would not do Dan Lamothe and John Wagner contributed to this reportNorth Korea has successfully produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can fit inside its missiles crossing a key threshold on the path to becoming a full-fledged nuclear power US intelligence officials have concluded in a confidential assessmentThe analysis completed last month by the Defense Intelligence Agency comes on the heels of another intelligence assessment that sharply raises the official estimate for the total number of bombs in the communist countrys atomic arsenal The United States calculated last month that up to 60 nuclear weapons are now controlled by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un Some independent experts think the number is much smallerThe findings are likely to deepen concerns about an evolving North Korean military threat that appears to be advancing far more rapidly than many experts had predicted US officials concluded last month that Pyongyang is also outpacing expectations in its effort to build an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the American mainlandPresident Trump speaking Tuesday at an event at his golf course in Bedminster NJ said North Korea will face a devastating response if its threats continue They will be met with fire and fury and frankly power the likes of which this world has never seen before he saidEarlier Tuesday North Korea described a new round of UN sanctions as an attempt to strangle a nation and warned that in response physical action will be taken mercilessly with the mobilization of all its national strength  Although more than a decade has passed since North Koreas first nuclear detonation many analysts thought it would be years before the countrys weapons scientists could design a compact warhead that could be delivered by missile to distant targets But the new assessment a summary document dated July 28 concludes that this critical milestone has been reachedThe IC [intelligence community] assesses North Korea has produced nuclear weapons for ballistic missile delivery to include delivery by ICBM-class missiles the assessment states in an excerpt read to The Washington Post Two US officials familiar with the assessment verified its broad conclusions It is not known whether the reclusive regime has successfully tested the smaller design although North Korea officially claimed last year that it had done soThe DIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to commentAn assessment this week by the Japanese Ministry of Defense also concludes that there is evidence to suggest that North Korea has achieved miniaturization Kim is becoming increasingly confident in the reliability of his nuclear arsenal analysts have concluded explaining perhaps the dictators willingness to engage in defiant behavior including missile tests that have drawn criticism even from North Koreas closest ally China On Saturday China and Russia joined other members of the UN Security Council  including a ban on exports that supply up to a third of North Koreas annual $3billion in earnings   The nuclear progress further raises the stakes for Trump who has vowed that North Korea will never be allowed to threaten the United States with nuclear weapons In an interview broadcast Saturday on MSNBCs Hugh Hewitt Show national security adviser HR McMaster said the prospect of a North Korea armed with nuclear-tipped ICBMs would be intolerable from the presidents perspectiveWe have to provide all options  and that includes a military option he said But McMaster said the administration would do everything short of war to pressure Kim Jong Un and those around him such that they conclude it is in their interest to denuclearize The options said to be under discussion range from new multilateral negotiations to reintroducing US battlefield nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula officials familiar with internal discussions saidAt the same time the administration has been attempting to push North Korea toward talks but Pyongyang has shown no interest in dialogue  Determining the precise makeup of North Koreas nuclear arsenal has long been a difficult challenge for intelligence officials because of the regimes culture of extreme secrecy and insularity The countrys weapons scientists have conducted five nuclear tests since 2006 the latest being a 20- to 30-kiloton detonation on Sept 9 2016 that produced a blast estimated to be up to twice that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima Japan in 1945But producing a compact nuclear warhead that can fit inside a missile is a technically demanding feat one that many analysts thought was still beyond North Koreas grasp Last year state-run media in Pyongyang displayed a spherical device that government spokesmen described as a miniaturized nuclear warhead but whether it was a real bomb remained unclear North Korean officials described the September detonation as a successful test of a small warhead designed to fit on a missile although many experts were skeptical of the claimKim has repeatedly proclaimed his intention to field a fleet of nuclear-tipped ICBMs as a guarantor of his regimes survival His regime took a major step toward that goal last month with  Video analysis of the latest test led some analysts to conclude that the missile caught fire and disintegrated as it plunged back toward Earths surface suggesting that North Koreas engineers might not be capable yet of building a reentry vehicle that can carry the warhead safely through the upper atmosphere But US analysts and many independent experts think this hurdle will be overcome by late next yearWhat initially looked like a slow-motion Cuban missile crisis is now looking more like the Manhattan Project just barreling along said Robert Litwak a nonproliferation expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the author of  published by the center this year Theres a sense of urgency behind the program that is new to the Kim Jong Un eraAlthough few discount North Koreas progress some prominent US experts warned against the danger of overestimating the threat Siegfried Hecker director emeritus of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the last known US official to inspect North Koreas nuclear facilities has calculated the size of North Koreas arsenal at no more than 20 to 25 bombs He warned of potential risks that can come from making Kim into a bigger menace than he actually is  Overselling is particularly dangerous said Hecker who visited North Korea seven times between 2004 and 2010 and met with key leaders of the countrys weapons programs Some like to depict Kim as being crazy  a madman  and that makes the public believe that the guy is undeterrable Hes not crazy and hes not suicidal And hes not even unpredictableThe real threat Hecker said is were going to stumble into a nuclear war on the Korean PeninsulaIn the past US intelligence agencies have occasionally overestimated the North Korean threat In the early 2000s the George W Bush administration assessed that Pyongyang was close to developing an ICBM that could strike the US mainland  a prediction that missed the mark by more than a decade More recently however analysts and policymakers have been surprised repeatedly as North Korea achieved key milestones months or years ahead of schedule said Jeffrey Lewis director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies There was similar skepticism about Chinas capabilities in the early 1960s said Lewis who has studied that countrys pathway to a successful nuclear test in 1964There is no reason to think that the North Koreans arent making the same progress after so many successful nuclear explosions Lewis said The big question is Why do we hold the North Koreans to a different standard than we held [Joseph] Stalins Soviet Union or Mao Zedongs China North Korea is testing underground so were always going to lack a lot of details But it seems to me a lot of people are insisting on impossible levels of proof because they simply dont want to accept what should be pretty obvious Yuki Oda in Tokyo contributed to this reportNorth Koreas powerful nuclear test this month may have been even stronger than first reported equivalent to roughly 17 times the strength of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima according to a new analysis by a US monitoring think tankNorth Koreas Sept3 nuclear test its sixth and biggest showed how much progress the country has made on its nuclear programEstimates of the bombs yield or the amount of energy released by the blast have ranged from South Koreas 50kilotons to Japans 160kilotons although some analysts have said the 63magnitude of the earthquake caused by the detonation could put it into the hundreds of kilotons This would put it into the realm of thermonuclear weapons supporting North Koreas claim that it had tested a hydrogen bombIn comparison the bomb detonated over Hiroshima in 1945 released about 15kilotons of energyThe newby 38 North run by the US-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies found North Koreas test may have been much strongerUpdated seismic data showed the magnitude of the resulting earthquake was greater than initial estimates  between 61 and 63 That means the yield of the latest test was roughly 250kilotons reported 38 Norths Frank V Pabian Joseph S Bermudez Jr and Jack LiuIn other words the North Korean test may have been almost 17 times stronger than the bomb detonated over Hiroshima This is close to what 38 North previously calculated as the maximum yield that could be contained at the underground Punggye-ri test siteThis new estimate by 38 North is much higher than initial estimates from US intelligence sources and allies The United States intelligence assessment put the blast at 140kilotons Japan at 160kilotons and South Korea at 50kilotonsExperts at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey Calif said that the size of the earthquake triggered by the explosion also suggested that the bomb could have had a force in the hundreds of kilotonsThe Pentagon declined to comment calling it an intelligence matterA US intelligence official said the 38 North analysis is consistent with the range of estimates by the intelligence community The Air Force Technical Applications Centers early estimate was a range of 70 to 280kilotons based on the possible magnitude the official said Satellite imagery showed the test resulted in many more landslides than after any of the previous five tests according to the 38 North analysisNorth Korea described the device it had detonated as a hydrogen bomb designed to be carried by a long-range missile capable of reaching the US mainland The international community widely condemned the test and within 10 days the UN Security Council unanimously approved its toughest sanctions on the country to dateIn the wake of the North Korean test both the United States and South Korea are highlighting their own military readinessDefense Secretary Jim Mattis was traveling Wednesday to Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota the center of the American nuclear arsenal with more than 100 land-based nuclear missiles and aircraftMeanwhile the South Korean Air Force on Wednesday conducted its first live-fire drill to test its preemptive strike capability according to the South Korean Defense Ministry Anna Fifield in Tokyo and Ellen Nakashima in Washington contributed to this reportNorth Korean government officials have been quietly trying to arrange talks with Republican-linked analysts in Washington in an apparent attempt to make sense of President Trump and his confusing messages to Kim Jong Uns regimeThe outreach began before the between the two leaders but probably will become more urgent as Trump and Kim have descended into name-calling that many analysts worry sharply increases the chances of potentially catastrophic misunderstandingsTheir number-one concern is Trump They cant figure him out said one person with direct knowledge of North Koreas approach of experts on Asia with Republican connectionsThere is no suggestion that the North Koreans are interested in negotiations about their nuclear program and the Trump administration has made clear it is not interested in talking right now Intermediaries instead seem to want forums for insisting on being recognized as a nuclear stateAt a multilateral meeting in Switzerland earlier this month North Koreas representativeswere adamant about being recognized as a nuclear-weapons state and showed no willingness to even talk about denuclearizationBut to get a better understanding of American intentions in the absence of official diplomatic talks with the US government North Koreas mission to the United Nations invited a former CIA analyst who is now the Heritage Foundations top expert on North Korea to visit Pyongyang for meetingsTrump has close ties to Heritage a conservative think tank that has influenced the president on everything from travel restrictions to defense spending but no personal connection to KlingnerTheyre on a new binge of reaching out to American scholars and ex-officials said Klingnerwho declined the North Korean invitationWhile such meetings are useful if the regime wants to send a clear message it should reach out directly to the US governmentNorth Korean intermediaries also have approached who served as an Asia expert on the National Security Council under presidents Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush and is now vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International PeaceThey wanted Paal to arrange talks between North Korean officials and American experts with Republican tiesin a neutral location such as Switzerland He also declined the North Korean requestThe North Koreans are clearly eager to deliver a message But I think theyre only interested in getting some travel in getting out of the country for a bit Paal said  North Korea has about seven such invitations out to organizations that have hosted previous talks  a surprising number of requests for a country that is threatening to launch a nuclear strike on the United StatesOver the past two years in particular Pyongyang has sent officials from its Foreign Ministry to hold meetings with Americans  usually former diplomats and think-tankers  in neutral places such as Geneva Singapore and Kuala Lumpur MalaysiaThey are referred to as because they are official (Track 1) on the North Korean side but unofficial (Track 2) on the American side although the US government is kept informed of the discussionsBut since Trumps election the North Korean representatives have been predominantly interested in figuring out the unconventional presidents strategy according to almost a dozen people involved in the discussions All spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk about the sensitive meetingsEarly in Trumps term the North Koreans asked broad questions Is the US president serious about closing American military bases in South Korea and Japanas he said on the campaign trail Might he really send US nuclear weapons back to the southern half of the Korean Peninsula  But the questions since then have become more specific Why for instance are Trumps top officials notably Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson directly contradicting the president so oftenThe North Koreans are reaching out through various channels and through various counterparts said Evans Revere a former State Department official who dealt with North Korea and is a frequent participant in such talks There are several theories about why North Korea is doing thisMy own guess is that they are somewhat puzzled as to the direction in which the US is going so theyre trying to open up channels to take the pulse in Washington Revere said They havent seen the US act like this beforeRevere attended a multilateral meeting with North Korean officials in the picturesque Swiss village of Glion earlier this month together with chairman of the Pacific Forum of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and another frequent interlocutor with Pyongyangs representativesThe meeting is an annual event organized by the a government-linked think tank But it took on extra significance this year due to the sudden rise in tensions between North Korea and the United StatesAll countries involved in the now-defunct six-party denuclearization talks  the United States China Japan Russia and the two Koreas  were represented as were Mongolia Switzerland and the European Union The Swiss invited the US government to send an official but it did notThe North Koreans at the meeting displayed an encyclopedic knowledge of Trumps tweets to the extent that they were able to quote them back to the Americans present  Pyongyangs delegation was headed by Choe Kang Il deputy director of the Americas division in the Foreign Ministry He was accompanied by three officials in their late 20s who wowed the other participants with their intellectual analysis and perfect American-accented English One even explained to the other delegates how the US Congress worksThey were as self-confident as Ive ever seen them said Cossa Revere added They may be puzzled about our intentions but they have a very clear set of intentions of their ownThe participants declined to divulge the contents of the discussions as they were off the recordBut others familiar with the talks said the North Koreans completely ruled out the freeze-for-freeze idea being promoted by China and Russia in which Pyongyang would freeze its nuclear and missile activities if the United States stopped conducting military exercises in South Korea The United States Japan and South Korea also outright reject the ideaParticipants left the day-and-a-half-long meeting with little hope for any improvement anytime soonIm very pessimistic said Shin Beom-chul a North Korea expert at the Souths after participating in the Glion meeting They want to keep their nuclear weapons and they will only return to dialogue after the United States nullifies its hostile policy They want the US to stop all military exercises and lift all sanctions on them  who teaches at Keio University in Japan and was also at the meeting said North Korea may still be interested in dialogue but on terms that are unacceptable to the other sideNorth Korea wants to be recognized as a nuclear-weapons state Jimbo said But when is North Korea ready for talks This is what I kept asking the North Koreans How much is enoughNorth Korea put on a huge military spectacle Saturday to celebrate its founders birthday parading its series of new and technologically advancedmissiles in front of Kim Jong Un and in a defiant show of force in front of the worldNorth Korea did not however carry out another or against widespread speculation that it would seek to celebrate Kim Il Sungs 105th birthday with a bang  April 15 is the most important day in the North Korean calendar and Kim Jong Un has celebrated his grandfathers birthday with great fanfare as a way to boost his own legitimacy as the successor to the communist dynastyNorth Korea presented two of its newest model missiles at the parade in Kim Il Sung Square on Saturday including theit successfully fired last year and the it launched last monthAnd there were a lot of them said Melissa Hanham an expert at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in CaliforniaThe signal that theyre trying to send is that they are moving ahead with solid-fuel missilesNorth Korea has been working on solid fuel  which unlike liquid fuel can be preloaded into missiles  as a way to fire missiles quickly to avoid prior detection by satellitesAnalysts were working to identify all the missiles that were shown off on Saturday many of which appeared to have new paint jobs or be variants of known missiles  One of the missiles looked similar to theKN-08 intercontinental ballistic missile that North Korea had included in previous parades This missile has a theoretical range of about 7500 miles which is enough to reach all of the United States from North Korea said Joshua Pollack editor of the Nonproliferation ReviewIt also put two ICBM canisters which protect solid-fueled missiles from the effects of the environment on the trucks that had carried the ICBMs previously One may have been a KN-14 another although it has a slightly shorter rangeThe trucks that carried the missile canisters were Chinese ones that have been exported to North Koreas Forestry Ministry but have shown up in military parades like this oneSaturdays display was worrying Hanham saidThey have an indigenous tank system now so they have more launchers and they have solid fuel which means they can launch a lot more of these things in quick succession without having to refuel she saidThe overall message to the world was that North Korea was pressing ahead with its missiles and making technological progressThe parade took place amid stern warnings from the outside world and mounting fears about some kind of military action in the region China has been particularly vocal in warning both sides to remain calmThe United States has to the Korean Peninsula region and President Trump has repeatedly tweeted that if China will not use its leverage to rein in North Korea the United States will actVice President Pence arrives in Seoul on Sunday on the first leg of an Asia tour and he will underscore Washingtons strong alliances with South Korea and Japan and its determination to stop North Koreas nuclear weapons program  Trump administration officials describe the situation as more dangerous than in the past because of the progress North Korea has made in its nuclear weapon and missile programs and because of the hostility on both sides But US officials said no decision has been made about how to respond to any new test  nuclear or ballistic  by North KoreaWhile officials do not rule out other actions they also stress their desire to ensure that the situation does not escalate out of control Pentagon officials denied recent media reports that the Trump administration is ready to launch a preemptive strike if North Korea appears to be about to conduct a nuclear test   North Korea has a habit of fueling tensions to increase the rewards it might extract from the outside world if it desists Previously the North has agreed to return to denuclearization talks in return for aid or the easing of sanctions  But with his approach Trump is tearing up the old playbook of how to deal with North Korea analysts saidThis approach to North Korea is relatively new said James Kim of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in SeoulThe approach in the past has been very calculatedThat has gone out the window with talk about military options he said We always knew all these options were there but no one was bold enough to go down that path Its a new approachRight now Trump has some cards to play said Kim of the Asan InstituteHe might say If you want one less battleship in the region what are you going to give me he said  a reversal of the usual situation in which North Korea asks what it can get from its adversaries in return for changing its behavior Simon Denyer in Beijing contributed to this reportVice President Pence told North Korea on Monday that it should not mistake the resolve of the United States of America to stand with our allies warning that military action is still a possibility to stop Kim Jong Uns regime from advancing its nuclear and missile programsThe vice president delivered the message as he stood just a few feet away from the military demarcation line that separates North and South Korea a line he described as a frontier of freedomThe people of North Korea the military of North Korea should not mistake the resolve of the United States of America to stand with our allies Pence said describing links with South Korea as ironcladThe vice president repeated the Trump administration line that the era of strategic patience is over referring to the Obama-era policy of putting pressure on North Korea and waiting until it became unbearablePence arrived in South Korea just hours after North Korea launched its   which exploded within a few seconds  and amid a weekend of fanfare in North Korea during which the regime showed off what appeared to be new missiles designed to reach the United StatesNorth Korea had been expected to do something provocative to mark the most important day on the regimes calendar the April 15 anniversary of founder Kim Il Sungs birthdayAlthough the vice president said that the United States wanted to deal with North Korea through peaceable means through negotiations he made it clear that military force would be used if necessary  All options are on the table as we continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of South Korea for denuclearization of this peninsula and for the long-term prosperity and freedom of the people of South Korea he said as he stood in a building near the line called Freedom HouseHe did not go into any of the blue conference buildings that straddle the line with North Korea When Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited South Korea last month and went into those conference buildings North Korean soldiers stood on the other side of the windows a few feet away taking photos of himPences remarks could reignite fears that military options for dealing with North Korea are still being consideredThe US Navy rerouted an aircraft carrier strike group to the region earlier this month as tensions were building and President Trump has repeatedly tweeted that the United States will take action to stop North Korea if China its closest ally doesntPence said Monday that he is hopeful that China will do more to solve the problem We look for them to do more he said  Earlier a White House foreign policy adviser traveling with Pence said that the United States did not need to take action to reinforce their failure referring to the missile launch North Korea has fired numerous medium-range missiles as Sundays appeared to be so one more made little differenceIf it had been a nuclear test then other actions would have been taken from the US the adviser told reporters on the vice presidents planeSome analysts were puzzled by thisIm not sure why failed missile tests which are still banned by the UN Security Council are considered less provocative said Kent Boydston a North Korea-focused research analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics The North Koreans know they may fail but they improve their capabilities each timeIndeed while the latest missile exploded soon after launch experts say North Korea is able to learn from its mistakes and hone its technology It had repeated failures with other missiles including the medium-range Musudan and a submarine-launched ballistic missile before successfully firing both North Koreas behavior will be the focus of Pences

return and allow war to break out on the peninsulaOn Sunday Chinas top diplomat Yang Jiechi spoke to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by telephone and the two exchanged views on the current situation on the Korean Peninsula Chinas foreign ministry said in a statementChina said it cut off coal imports from North Korea in February in accordance with UN Security Council sanctionsThe Global Times an English-language Chinese newspaper that does not necessarily reflect official policy recommended that Beijing convey a clear message to Pyongyang that if it conducts a sixth nuclear test the Chinese government would support stiffer UN sanctions to cut off the vast majority of its oil supplies to North KoreaThe US Navy sent a strike group to Korean waters last week but defense officials have said tougher sanctions and pressure was still the favored approach to dealing with North KoreaWeve got a range of options both militarily diplomatic and others  at disposal for the president should he choose to use them the White House foreign policy adviser told reporters on Air Force Two But for this particular case [of the failed missile launch]  we dont need to expend any resources against thatTensions are expected to continue for several weeks at leastLarge-scale annual exercises between the South Korean and US militaries will continue until the end of April and North Korea will mark

retaliation North Korea is thought to have conventional artillery lined up on its side of the DMZ trained on Seoul a city of 10 million people just 30 miles from the borderThe fear of devastation in Seoul  and the risk to the American troops based in and around the South Korean capital  has long restrained US administrations from striking North Korea Simon Denyer in Beijing contributed to this reportNorth Korea spurned harsh new UN sanctions Monday and threatened to defend itself with nuclear weapons if necessary as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson repeated an offer to bargain with the outcast nation under the right circumstancesThere was no sign at a major Asian security conference here that the sanctions hailed by President Trump as a foreign policy achievement would succeed where past efforts have failed in trying to persuade the country to give up its nuclear weaponsNorth Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told diplomats that his country will never negotiate away what he called a rational strategic option against the threat of attack from the United States We will under no circumstances put the nukes and ballistic rockets up for negotiation Ri said in prepared remarks adding that the entire United States is within range of its missilesHe dismissed the  approved Saturday as illegal appearing to rule out talks that the Trump administration in a diplomatic partnership with China and Russia is offering North Korea as a way out of its economic and diplomatic pariah status   The best signal that North Korea could send that theyre prepared to talk would be to stop these missile launches Tillerson told reporters Monday at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) gatheringThe security conference in the Philippine capital was dominated by the rising threat posed by North Koreas rapid advances in nuclear and ballistic missile technology Those capabilities are already a threat to neighbors and US allies South Korea and Japan In two tests last month North Korea demonstrated that it could hit major population centers in the United States and the country is now working to perfect the technology to allow those missiles to carry nuclear warheadsThe new economic sanctions were approved amid the discussions here The penalties are the toughest to date against a country that has been under international sanctions for more than a decade and they carry the symbolic weight of approval by Pyongyangs closest ally China They also approximate a trade embargo by targeting some of North Koreas biggest exports including coal  The sanctions can work only if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un concludes that he has too much to lose by hanging on to his weapons Kims calculation has been the opposite  that his weapons and the means to deliver them buy him irreplaceable leverage over the United States his principal adversaryChina is urging Kim to consider negotiations and also worked alongside the United States to develop the new UN sanctions Days before the unanimous Security Council vote Tillerson had made a point of saying that the United States does not consider North Korea its enemy and does not seek to invade the country or unseat Kim Those reassurances were meant to encourage North Korea to meet at the bargaining tableAt the same time Washington has issued blunt warnings that the United States will use military force if necessary and North Korea has answered in kindIn the printed version of his speech Ri said Pyongyang will use nuclear weapons only against the United States or any other country that might join it in  Ris address here was closed to the media so it could not be determined whether he stuck to a script delivered to reportersAnother direct warning was aimed at the United States in a government statement published by the state-run Korean Central News AgencyThere is no bigger mistake than the United States believing that its land is safe across the ocean it saidNorth Korea will make the US pay dearly for all the heinous crimes it commits against the state and people of this country the statement saidTillerson would not spell out a deadline for North Korea to respond to the diplomatic overtureWell know it when we see it he said MondayWe hope again that this ultimately will result in North Korea coming to a conclusion to choose a different pathway and when the conditions are right that we can sit and have a dialogue around the future of North Korea so that they feel secure and prosper economically he told reportersTillerson avoided running into Ri who attended the related ASEAN Regional Forum The State Department said he skipped one event where the two men might have met and left another early to attend a scheduled meeting with Philippine President Rodrigo DuterteTillerson and Trump spoke by phone for about an hour Monday and Tillerson detailed the results of his discussions in Manila the White House said United Nations Resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever on North Korea Trump wrote in a Twitter message Saturday Over one billion dollars in cost to NKOn Monday Trump complained that the US-led sanctions vote at the United Nations is not getting enough attention writing The Fake News Media will not talk about the importance of the United Nations Security Councils 15-0 vote in favor of sanctions on N Korea   North Korea rarely attends or is even invited to international forums such as the ASEAN meeting Ri tried to make the most of it holding meetings with the top diplomats from China and Russia two countries that trade with North Korea and employ North Koreans as contract workers China alone is responsible for 90percent of North Koreas tradeMoscow and Beijing have proposed a freeze for a freeze approach in which North Korea would suspend its missile and nuclear testing if the United States and its allies stop conducting joint military exercises in the region Washington has rejected thatAfter meeting with Ri Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called on all parties to show maximum restraint to avoid the projection of military power on the Korean Peninsula and immediately start seeking a political and diplomatic resolution to the problems of the peninsula including its denuclearizationChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said he told Ri that North Korea should abide by UN prohibitions against missile and nuclear testing But he also said that sanctions while needed are not the final goal and he called for dialogue Wang urged the United States and South Korea as well as the North not to increase tensions saying the situation already is at a critical pointChinese state media on Monday acknowledged that North Korea had to be punished for its missile tests but criticized the United States for its arroganceThe effectiveness of the new sanctions depends on how well China in particular decides to enforce them said Michael J Green of the Center for Strategic and International Studies who was an Asia export in the George W Bush administrationMore broadly Green said the time for effective diplomacy has almost certainly run out There is little to no chance that North Korea can be talked out of weapons it considers essential he saidThe North Korea strategy for decades has involved both carrots and sticks The problem is that the carrots are no longer credible he said  Gearan reported from

Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himselfDotard a person exhibiting a decline in mental faculties a weak-minded or foolish old person   Anna Fifield (@annafifield) Here is the full statement published by KCNA on Friday morningPyongyang September 22 (KCNA)  Respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK released a statement on ThursdayThe full text of the statement readsThe speech made by the US president in his maiden address on the UN arena in the prevailing serious circumstances in which the situation on the Korean peninsula has been rendered tense as never before and is inching closer to a touch-and-go state is arousing worldwide concernShaping the general idea of what he would say I expected he would make stereo-typed prepared remarks a little different from what he used to utter in his office on the spur of the moment as he had to speak on the worlds biggest official diplomatic stageBut far from making remarks of any persuasive power that can be viewed to be helpful to defusing tension he made unprecedented rude nonsense one has never heard from any of his predecessorsA frightened dog barks louderId like to advise Trump to exercise prudence in selecting words and to be considerate of whom he speaks to when making a speech in front of the worldThe mentally deranged behavior of the US president openly expressing on the UN arena the unethical will to totally destroy a sovereign state beyond the boundary of threats of regime change or overturn of social system makes even those with normal thinking faculty think about discretion and composureHis remarks remind me of such words as political layman and political heretic which were in vogue in reference to Trump during his presidential election campaignAfter taking office Trump has rendered the world restless through threats and blackmail against all countries in the world He is unfit to hold the prerogative of supreme command of a country and he is surely a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire rather than a politicianHis remarks which described the US option through straightforward expression of his will have convinced me rather than frightening or stopping me that the path I chose is correct and that it is the one I have to follow to the lastNow that Trump has denied the existence of and insulted me and my country in front of the eyes of the world and made the most ferocious declaration of a war in history that he would destroy the DPRK we will consider with seriousness exercising of a corresponding highest level of hard-line countermeasure in historyAction is the best option in treating the dotard who hard of hearing is uttering only what he wants to sayAs a man representing the DPRK and on behalf of the dignity and honor of my state and people and on my own I will make the man holding the prerogative of the supreme command in the US pay dearly for his speech calling for totally destroying the DPRKThis is not a rhetorical expression loved by TrumpI am now thinking hard about what response he could have expected when he allowed such eccentric words to trip off his tongueWhatever Trump might have expected he will face results beyond his expectationI will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fireKim Jong Un has taken another key step to consolidate his familys control over North Korea elevating his younger sister to the powerful political bureau of the ruling Workers Party and moving her closer to the center of the leadershipKim announced that his 30-year-old sister Kim Yo Jong had been promoted during a weekend of festivities celebrating the Kim familys grip on the totalitarian state and amid expectations of a new salvo of missilesThe North Korean regime will on Tuesday celebrate the 72nd anniversary of the founding of the Workers Party through which the Kim family controls the countryA top Korea analyst at the CIA last week said that the US government should be ready for another North Korean provocation this week  not least because the Oct 10 anniversary overlaps with Columbus Day in the United States given the 12-hour 30-minute time difference between Pyongyang and Washington This would provide North Korea with the opportunity to both celebrate an important day on its calendar and interfere with an American holiday weekendStand by your phones Yong Suk Lee deputy assistant director of the CIAs Korea Mission Center said he had told his staff He was speaking at a conference in Washington last weekHowever there were expectations that North Korea would do something incendiary on the same date last year when the day passed without a bangPresident Trump sent his own warning signal Saturday saying  that years of diplomatic negotiations and agreements with North Korea had come to nothing and that only one thing will work He did not say what that one thing was  But in Pyongyang on Saturday Kim was telling his officials that North Koreas nuclear weapons were a powerful deterrent and that the Workers Party of Korea would victoriously conclude the standoff with the USNorth Koreas nuclear weapons are necessary for defending the destiny and sovereignty of the country from the protracted nuclear threats of the US imperialists Kim who is chairman of the party among many other titles told the partys central committee at a meeting according to a state media reports published SundayA weekend of celebrations included a parade celebrating 20 years since Kim Jong Il the current leaders father was elected general secretary of the Workers Party Kim Jong Un also visited the mausoleum where his father and grandfather eternal president Kim Il Sung lie in stateThese events would seem like standard behavior in North Koreas personality cult if it werent for the appointment of Kim Yo Jong as an alternate member of the main political branch of the Workers PartyThe Rodong Sinmun the party newspaper showed photos of those who had been promoted at the meeting eight men in the their 60s or older and Kim Yo Jong the only woman and the only person not approaching pensionable age She is thought to have been born in 1987She is taking the place of their aunt Kim Jong Ils sister Kim Kyong Hui who has not been seen in public since Kim Jong Un had her husband Jang Song Thaek executed in 2013 Intelligence analysts believe she is still alive but very sick and no longer involved in the leadershipAnalysts saw the sisters elevation as the latest sign that Kim Jong Un is trying to boost her standing in the regime The Kim family claims its legitimacy through the Paektu bloodline  the idea that their family has been destined by a sacred Korean mountain to lead the country  Kim Jong Un who is 33 has played up the bloodline angle as he has sought to cement his claim to be his fathers rightful successor But it is is not clear who would succeed Kim Jong Un if he were to die suddenlyHe is thought to have two or three children at least one of whom is a boy but they are all younger than 6 years old Michael Madden an expert on the Kim family who runs the North Korea Leadership Watch blog thinks that Kim Jong Un might be positioning his sister as the next heir to the family dynastyKim Yo Jong was involved in ensuring the succession process from her father to her brother and has taken on a series of  over the past few years In 2014 she was made deputy director of the Workers Party Propaganda and Agitation Department  a position that led the Treasury Department to  in January for her role in censoring information in North KoreaThe role is not just symbolic She was seen working during a big parade in Pyongyang in April rushing out from behind pillars to bring paperwork to her brother She also appeared on stage with him during the opening of a landmark construction project in the capital Ryomyong Street where she was dressed in a functional black suit and appeared to be coordinating photographers and other logisticsKim Yo Jong is very influential said Lim Jae-cheon a Kim family expert at Korea University in Seoul She is doing her job in the propaganda department but I dont think shes involved in other areasLim does not think she is seen as a potential successor in highly Confucian  hierarchical and male-dominated  North Korea She cant be leader Shes a female he said  As with many other figures in North Koreas opaque leadership little else is known about Kim Yo Jong Some South Korean and Japanese newspapers have reported that shes married to a senior finance official and that they have at least one child Another report has it that she fell in love with a bodyguard And another says shes single and childlessRegardless she is clearly close to her brother The two together with oldest brother Kim Jong Chul are full-blood siblings the children of Kim Jong Il and his second wife Ko Yong Hui They all went to school in Switzerland in the 1990sAmong the other personnel changes this weekend Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho  the man who called Trump mentally deranged when he visited New York for the UN General Assembly last month and threatened to detonate a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific  was promoted from being an alternate to a full member of the PolitburoNorthKoreas bombastic threats are jangling nerves in both the United States and in Asia with many analysts worried that the war of words between President Trump and Kim Jong Un will turn into an actual war  and possibly a nuclear oneBoth leaders are trying to outdo each other in the insult department from rocket man and  to little rocket man and the ringleader of aggressorsAlthough the threats are colorful  on both sides  experts on North Korea say they are in keeping with North Koreas history of bluster and do not signal a significant change in North Koreas thinkingIm not concerned North Korea likes colorful rhetoric and they always have said Tatiana Gabroussenko a specialist on North Korean propaganda who teaches at Korea University in Seoul The problem now is Mr Trump He reacts he answers he tweets so hes making it visibleTrump on Tuesday  that if the United States decides to take military action against North Korea it would be devastatingThe comment prompted a rebuke from Pyongyang Trump declared a war against the DPRK through his wild remarks declared an editorial Wednesday in Rodong Sinmun the mouthpiece of the Korean Workers PartyThe army and people of the DPRK will surely make the old lunatic pay for his rude speech it said using the official abbreviation for North KoreaAfter Trump called Kim rocket man during his address to the United Nations General Assembly last week the North Korean leader issued a highly unusual and direct statement about the American president calling him mentally deranged and saying he would pay for the insultTrump doubled down calling Kim little rocket man leading the North Korean foreign minister to say the president had declared war and to issue a brazen threat to shoot down American warplanes even if they are not in North Korean airspaceWith American fighter jets now doing drills across South Korea near the border with the North on a regular basis many experts are worried about the possibility for miscalculation or misunderstanding  North Korea has continued churning out propaganda with its trademark braggadocioUS imperialist warmongers are bluffing being buoyed by war fever after proposing military counteraction against the DPRK again the Norths state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported Tuesday Literally the whole country is permeated with the spirit to annihilate war maniac and old lunatic Trump on the earthThese threats have gone the North Korean version of viral More than 100000 people took part in a regime-organized rally in Pyongyang on Saturday to show they were ready to remove the US imperialists the sworn enemy from the globe KCNA reportedPhotos from the rally showed orderly columns of men in workers suits and students in white shirts and red ties some holding signs declaring The US is the headquarters of evilKCNA quoted one participant as saying that Trumps recent comments were the most ignorant remarks ever known in history while another said they were insaneBut Gabroussenko said these kinds of demonstrations are not new in North Korea The change has been in the attention being paid to the rhetoric not in the rhetoric itselfYou can go back to North Korean rhetoric from the 1950s and find this kind of anti-Americanism she said Anti-Americanism is the basis of North Korean culture and history  Shen Dingli deputy dean of the Institute of International Affairs at Fudan University in Shanghai agreed that the rhetoric is overblownAll these provocations are verbal Shen said adding that Pyongyang does not want warNorth Korea already threatened to attack Guam but they didnt Its artillery can blast Seoul and any of its nuclear weapons could turn Northeast Asia upside down But would they start a war first he said No their nuclear weapons are for self-defense and they are aware the United States will wipe them off the Earth if they hit itAt the same time that North Korea has been making these incendiary statements about the United States there has also been a remarkable  and almost entirely overlooked  outburst directed at ChinaA commentary published Friday on KCNA and signed by Jong Phil ostensibly attacked Chinas rude and shameless media for saying North Korea deserved to be sanctioned by the United Nations over its nuclear weapons programThis wasa veiled criticism of Chinese President Xi Jinping just three weeks before he opens the Congress of the Communist Party which is held every five years Adam Cathcart a China scholar at the University of Leeds who reads North Koreas propaganda closely believes that Jong Phil is a pen name for Kim himself just as Mao and Stalin used aliases to write signed editorialsThis is the third such editorial this year by Jong Phil  which means Righteous Pen  and the most pointed The week after China backed tough new sanctions on North Korea through the United Nations it accused Chinese state media of kowtowing to the ignorant acts of the Trump administration  North Korea was wondering how a fellow socialist country could maliciously collude with the imperialists the editorial saidThis leaves us thinkingwhether they shouldbe entitled to enter the coming party conference hall only when they register the dirty reptile records of betraying the peoples of the two countries the editorial said alluding to the upcoming congress Cathcart said the statement was extraordinary giventhat China is North Koreas biggest trading partner and protector Theyre basically accusing China of being revisionists who have no idea how happy the people of North Korea are he saidNor was it clear why North Korea would risk making such a statement at such an important time for the Chinese Communist Party Theyre basically telling China to go back to their socialist roots Whats the long-term tactical thinking hereBut Cathcart was encouraged by with the Trump administrationShen added that all of this rhetoric is designed to increase the temperature and bring about a return to talks albeit on North Koreas terms of being recognized as a nuclear weapons stateThat means the United States now has two options he said Reject talks with North Korea and watchit build more and more nuclear weapons or hold talks with North Korea so Pyongyang will suspendits nuclear developmentThe United States needs to choose the less harmful option of the two Shen said Fifield reported from Bern Switzerland Rauhala reported from Beijing Shirley Feng in Beijing

Wednesday at an event hosted by theBill & Melinda Gates Foundation former president Barack Obama said that any effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act would end upinflicting real human suffering on Americans who had gained health coverage and consumer protections under the 2010 lawObamas remarks made at the foundations inaugural Goalkeepers event in New York City comes as Republican leaders on Capitol Hill are waging an intense push to pass a measure sponsored by Republican SensLindsey O Graham (SC) and Bill Cassidy (La) that would transfer the funding provided under the law  and many of its requirements  to the states where they could be dramatically altered It also makes deep cuts to the existing Medicaid program  It wasnt perfect but it was better the former president said of the ACA And so when I see people trying to undo that hard-won progress for the 50th or 60th time with bills that would raise costs or reduce coverage or roll back protections for older Americans people with preexisting conditions the cancer survivor the expectant mom or the child with autism or asthma for whom coverage will once again will be unattainable it is aggravatingAnd its certainly frustrating to have to mobilize every couple of months to keep our leaders from inflicting real human suffering on our constituents Obama added But typically that is how progress is won and how progress is maintained on every single issueWe have to stand up for each other and recognize that progress is never inevitable that it often can be fragile its in need of constant renewal he continued and our individual progress and our collective progress depends on our willingness to roll up our sleeves and work and not be afraid to workGraham issued a quick retort noting in a statement Its unrealistic to expect President Obama would acknowledge his signature issue is failingIts no surprise President Obama opposes sending money and power back to the states and closer to where the patients live Graham added Obamacare was designed with the exact opposite goal in mind  which is to consolidate health care power and decision-making in WashingtonWhile Obama received a warm reception from the audience  which laughed when he mentioned Republicans attempts to repeal the ACA for the 50th or 60th time  his comments are unlikely to influence the current debate on the Hill There are just a handful of Republican senators who will tip the balance one way or another on the Cassidy-Graham proposal becauseit needs 50 votes to pass under current budget rules and then passage of the bill in the Housewill hinge largely on whether conservative lawmakers there and Republicans from states that would be disproportionately affected by the legislation are willing to back the measurehttps//twittercom/RTC_NYC/status/835343752386514944When Mike Pence  he received a personal message from the cast hopeful their show had inspired the then-vice president-elect to uphold our

Nov 21 And on Jan 23 President Trump did just that signing an  to pull the US out of the TPP Its a largely symbolic move but a sign that the new administration is likely to take a less-than-global view of global tradeWhat is the TPP and why was there such opposition from both the Trump and Clinton campaignsTwelve countries reached agreement in this international trade agreement in October 2015 Australia Brunei Canada Chile Japan Malaysia Mexico New Zealand Peru Singapore the United States and Vietnam The US Congress never ratified the agreement which promised to cut tariffs on some  institute new protections for  and the in TPP countriesand provide an These 12 nations generate about 40 percent of global trade Major US trading partners like China and the European Union are notably  as is Russia Former president Barack Obamas argued that the United States should lead the Asia-Pacific trade agendaWhen more than 95 percent of our potential customers live outside our borders we cant let countries like China write the rules of the global economyWe should write those rules opening new markets to American products while setting high standards for protecting workers and preserving our environmentThe Obama administration claimed the in the Asia-Pacific region support more than $2 trillion in US exports of goods and services each year and increase the number of export-related jobs created in the United States By  the TPP would have little impact on overall US GDP because the two largest US trading partners  Canada and Mexico  had already cut tariffs on US goods as part of the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement ()During the 2016 presidential election campaign  argued that the TPP would send US jobs overseas and promised to withdraw from the agreement  and to pursue bilateral trade agreements instead Both Hillary Clinton and her running mate Sen Tim Kaine (D-Va) had supported the TPP in the past but during the campaign came out Anti-TPP demonstrations took place during both the Republican and Democratic conventions in summer 2016  voiced their strong opposition to an agreement they felt might threaten jobs in the United StatesOn Nov 11 the  acknowledged that Obama would not move forward to ratify the agreement in his final weeks in officeA number of recent Monkey Cage posts look at the TPP from various angles Here are some of the analysesThe trucks still rumble across the Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge and a nearby pipeline still pumps crude oil to keep the regime alive in PyongyangBut here in the Chinese city of Dandong at the center of this countrys trade with North Korea pain and frustration are mountingSanctions approved by the UN Security Council to punish North Korea for its nuclear and missile tests and bring it to the negotiating table are starting to bitePersonally the sanctions are hurting me a tremendous amount one Chinese trader said explaining that almost 80percent of the goods he used to move back and forth across the border  ranging from textiles to chemicals  are now forbiddenBoth Chinese and North Korean business executives have the same thought  whatever happens let it happen quickly he said requesting anonymity to speak on a sensitive subject If we have to have war at least let it happen soon We have to settle this quickly Things cant go on like thisSuccessive rounds of UN sanctions have cut off more than 90 percent of North Koreas publicly reported exports  including coal iron ore seafood and most recently textiles  and have restricted the regimes ability to earn foreign currency income by sending workers abroadChina accounts for roughly 85percent of North Koreas external trade and is seen by many as the key to forcing Pyongyang to at least freeze its nuclear and missile programsAlong with Moscow Beijing has balked at US talk of a complete trade embargo But foreign and Chinese experts said it has been implementing UN sanctions with unusual rigor and applying real pressure on provincial and local government officials in the border regionThe trader of ethnic Korean descent said he had not seen a worse climate in nearly two decades of doing business across the border Nor had he seen the Chinese government so determined to impose its will  despite a lobbying effort from the local business communityCustoms checks have become more stringent at the border traders said causing delays in addition to making it harder to smuggle banned itemsIn August protests erupted near the northern end of the border in the Chinese city of Hunchun after Beijing moved to ban seafood imports from North KoreaLu Chao a Korea expert at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences said Chinese cold-storage plants and seafood processing workshops across the border have fallen idle while companies involved in textiles coal and iron ore are also suffering Travel agents sending Chinese tourists to North Korea have seen their revenue affectedSanctions bring a huge loss to Chinese traders Lu said Many companies doing border trade have gone bankrupt and their owners run away leaving people unemployedIn Dandong a city that sits at the mouth of the Yalu River at the southern end of the border and that accounts for roughly 70percent of cross-border trade small groups of North Korean business executives are still easy to spot walking the streets and in hotels and restaurants near the bridge Their plain and somber clothing of dark blues grays and greens is livened only by the obligatory badge carrying the faces of the ruling Kim dynastyBut outside the customs depot on the edge of town  where trucks are loaded and inspected before rolling across the border  two packers said traffic was fallingOnYijing Street where North Korean traders head to place their orders their Chinese counterparts told a similar story One woman who sells clothes to North Korea  old-fashioned colors nothing bright garments suitable for a cold country she explained  has seen sales cut in half this yearChina stopped buying their coal and their money began to run out she saidAnother woman said her business  sending textiles across the border for assembly and bringing them back as clothing for sale in China  was hurting badly after Beijing banned the trade last week to comply with the latest UN resolutionWe dont dare send anything across the border now she said and were trying to get our stuff back from there as quickly as possibleSo far though sanctions have had a relatively modest effect on the overall trade numbers In August Chinas imports from North Korea fell a modest 1percent from a year ago while exports were down 62percent On a cumulative basis total trade was actually up 75percent in the first eight months of the yearThat may partly reflect North Koreas ability to adapt to sanctions as well as stockpiling by the regime and an attempt by traders to move goods across the border before sanctions hit experts saidChinese exports of corn bananas and rice rose sharply and there was even a shipment of 18million tons of coal in August  six months after a ban was supposedly implementedCommerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng told reporters in Beijing that UN sanctions allowed a cushioning period after a ban is imposed  Experts said China normally allowed shipments to go through if they had been agreed on before sanctions were announcedBut a bigger question perhaps is whether smugglers can bypass the sanctionsIn the seafood markets of Dandong there are signs that they can  to some extentWater-filled tanks of crabs and clams dominate the offerings With Chinese waters overfished most would have come from North Korean waters in the Yellow Sea one trader said Another man delivering crabs to the market from the back of his truck complained that the ban had pushed up the price of the North Korean crustaceans by roughly 50percent which in turn had depressed demandThe formal trade from North Korea has stopped a third trader said but there are still ways of getting it for people who are brave and willing to take the riskFishing boats from Dandong used to cross to North Korea to pick up seafood bringing it back to China to pass off as their own catch bypassing customsUntil recently many did so openly during the day but now the boats travel only at night traders and fishermen saidAt the small but usually thriving Yicuomao port on a small channel of the Yalu River scores of blue-painted wooden and steel fishing boats lay idleSome fishermen said they were losing money but not everyone wasIf you have connections you can still go out said one fisherman unhappy at the unfairness of the situation On the surface China is implementing sanctions but it isnt really If it really wanted to it could just put a warship here to close off the estuaryExperts said China cant be expected to completely shut down smuggling across the 880-mile border any more than the United States can easily end illegal immigration from Mexico But there are also reasons to doubt whether local officials are trying as hard as they might said Christopher Green senior adviser for the Korean Peninsula at the International Crisis GroupWhile Chinese President Xi Jinping is reported to have disdain for his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Un relationships at provincial and municipal levels especially in security services have always been very good A little leakage serves to defuse domestic tensions and maintain that cross-border network Green saysWithin North Korea the economy is almost designed to withstand sanctions When times are tough trade will be even more strictly cornered by the military and security apparatus The ban on textiles meanwhile will have a disproportionate effect on women in North Korea who assemble garmentsThe pain is felt at lower levels Green said That is not to say sanctions are bad but invariably the effects flow downhill at the end of the dayNear the village of Xingguang on the outskirts of Dandong paramilitary troops and a fire company guard 10 large oil storage tanks the start of an underground pipeline that supplies North Korea with the crude it needs to keep its military and industry running It is a symbol of Beijings bottom line keeping the Pyongyang regime aliveNorth Korea has apparently been stockpiling fuel experts said one reason that civilian fuel prices there have risen significantly this year It also means that the North could probably withstand a temporary cut in oil suppliesBut Beijing will never completely cut the regimes jugular vein experts saidIt fears that a cut in oil supplies could leave China facing a nightmare scenario either a hostile and desperate nuclear-armed enemy or if the regime collapsed a refugee crisis followed by an American puppet state

Liberal Democratic Party roared to a major electoral victory in snap elections that he had called Prospects were further boosted when Tokyos popular governor Yuriko Koike  earlier that she had decided not to challenge Abe for the prime ministers postRetaining a two-thirds supermajority in the lower house of the Diet or Japans parliament gives Abe the opportunity to rewrite Japans constitution which since it was imposed on Japan in 1947 by the United States has committed Japan to the complete renunciation of war Now Abe wants to change the constitution to allow Japans Self-Defense Forces to fight in defense of Japans allies such as the United States In a sign of just how much things have changed in Asia for decades the US government was of two minds about whether Japan should revise its constitution No longerSince Trumps election Abe has courted the American president a marked contrast to European leaders who have scored political points by distancing themselves from the US administration Abe took a big political risk when he traveled to Trump Tower before the inauguration to huddle with the president-elect Remember at the time that Abe and outgoing President Barack Obama had just concluded parallel visits  to Hiroshima in May 2016 and Pearl Harbor in December 2016  that were fraught with political symbolismAfter the Trump Tower visit Abe returned to the United States in February for a summit with Trump at Mar-a-Lago during which Abe and the rest of his team faced with general chaos on the American side staffed the meetings set the agenda and organized a news conference afterward In the middle of the summit North Korea launched a missile and Trump and Abe were photographed discussing the affair over candlelight in the packed dining hall at Trumps club Since then the two have spoken by phone Two things appear to be driving Abes courtship of the American president The first is that Japan faced with a rising China and a belligerent North Korea (the state-run news agency recently branded Abe a headless chicken) still needs the United States as an ally and a trading partner During the election campaign Japan was spooked by Trumps attack on US alliances in Asia and his suggestion that perhaps Japan and South Korea should become nuclear powers and defend themselves Instead of criticizing or cold-shouldering the president Abe hugged him tighter His diplomacy paid off when the two sides issued a joint communiqu in which the Trump administration again committed itself to the defense of the Senkaku Islands which are also claimed by ChinaAbe has also not given up on the Trans-Pacific Partnership a trade deal involving 12 nations in the Asia-Pacific region that was negotiated by the Obama administration but that Trump rejected upon entering office Abe spent a lot of time in that golf cart at Mar-a-Lago telling Trump why TPP is important said Sheila Smith an expert on Japanese politics at the Council on Foreign Relations Abes government has continued to discuss the possibility of enacting a TPP minus the United States in the hope that the United States would ultimately join the pactA second reason for Abes determined diplomacy is that as a leader he appears to have matured Abes grandfather Nobusuke Kishi was jailed for three years as a suspected war criminal after World War II and Abe has written that he entered politics and embraced conservative causes in part to clear his familys name Abes attempts to battle with the past dominated his first tour as Japans prime minister in 2006 But he bombed and citing health reasons resigned after a year in officeAbe returned to power in December 2012 chastened by his failure and less focused on trying to expunge Japanese guilt for World War II I see someone who has learned through hard experience and personal setbacks Smith saidAbe has also learned that Japan had better not put all its eggs in the American basket Trump is far from the only leader who has been subject to Abes version of a charm offensive Abe has held a summit with Russias Vladimir Putin He is close with Indias prime minister Narendra Modi He has tried to mend ties with Chinas Xi Jinping despite Chinas reluctance to play ball Since 2012 Abe has traveled to more than 50 countries selling nuclear power in the Middle East hawking high-speed rail to India and offering Japanese investment in Southeast AsiaFor decades successive US presidents have hectored their counterparts in Japan to emerge from Americas shadow and take more responsibility for their defense for foreign affairs and for other important issues around the world Now spurred by the unpredictability of the Trump administration Abe seems to be embracing American adviceThursday morning I chatted over the phone with Warren Moon about Deshaun Watson mining details for a feature story on Watsons astonishing rookie season Moon explained how they had first met when he presented Watson an award at a college football banquet Moon already admired Watsons on-field demeanor and performance but up close he respected him even more He had a quiet confident air He had the size to play NFL quarterback And he was humble enough to bring his mother Deann who battled tongue cancer during Watsons high school years as his date that nightI understood Moon said why the kid is headed for greatnessHours later in the early evening Moon sent a text messageI just heard he wrote Shockingly terribleThere was no other way to describe what had happened  an injury that ends his marvelous rookie season on the same day theleague named him AFC offensive player of the month Watson has been the brightest revelation of the NFLs first half vaulting into the fringes of the MVP conversation despite starting the season as the Texans backup quarterback a designation that lasted all of one halfWatson is tied for the NFL lead with 19 touchdown passes  the most ever for a player in his first seven games  and ranks second in yards per pass attempt He shredded the Patriots for more than 300 yards rushed for a 49-yard score in hisfirst pro startand hung 57 points on the Titans The Texans averaged 346 points in the six games Watson started He was both the most exciting and most appealing player in the league In a dreary season Watson was the best thing about the NFL  And now he represents another sad story line Set aside the rancor caused by the presidents remarks about protests during the national anthem and this has still been a brutal NFL season The list of players lost to season-ending injuries is dishearteningly long and it includes Aaron Rodgers Odell Beckham Jr JJ Watt Julian Edelman and Joe Thomas Just before Watson tore his ligament the Colts This weekend more players surely will sustain season-ending injuries stars or not Even at its best professional football is a celebration of human capability at the cost of human suffering This season has reinforced that with stunning routineWatsons injury felt especially cruel He tore his ACL not while expressing his talent or escaping danger but running a noncontact drill and making a false step No player deserves a season-ending injury but it seemed especially unwarranted for Watson a man  who donated his first game check to Texans cafeteria workers devastated by Hurricane Harvey He was allergic to controversy and brimmed with charismaWatson not only was producing historic numbers but also reshaping how NFL offenses operate Watson possesses the skill and smarts to run NFL concepts  Moon recalled watching Watson change protection schemes at the line like a veteran back in preseason But Coach Bill OBrien also included spread plays and concepts typically seen only in college The NFL is trying to figure out how best to transition spread quarterbacks into the pro ranks and Watsons mixture of deep passes read-option runs and accuracy was providing a templateI think hes going to help the NFL evolve with the way the quarterback position is played with the thing hes doing out there Moon said  Watson had been a testament to the power of the NFLs product His performance in the Texans 41-38 shootout loss in Seattle offered a brief reprieve to the unrelenting stories about fan unrest and shrinking ratings and palace intrigue Watson and Russell Wilson in a classic duel reminded fans why they put up with all the NFLs ills Losing Watson was the last thing the NFL neededIn half a season Watson had already outperformed the consensus view of NFL evaluators Despite his marvelous college career which included two mind-bending performances  two quarterbacks were taken before Watson  after several quarterback-needy teams passedA lot of us get caught up in the numbers and the pure performance and its that age-old thing about football said one NFL executive who requested anonymity to speak about another teams player Player acquisition and team building is about chemistry and leadership And he is a unique leader Hes like Brady Remember Michigan only won when Tom Brady was playing Not when Drew Henson was playingWatsons future remains hopeful but his rookie season now exists in the past tense Thursday started like any other day in the NFL By the end the most incandescent player in the league had been removed The best story in the NFL had become the saddest It was shocking and it was terrible  The Colts stress that Luck will be back to normal after more patience in his rehab but there seems to be a lot of reason to seriously worry about Lucks shoulder ever allowing him to return to his previous levelSEOUL  New radar satellite images show the Sept 3 nuclear test by North Korea was powerful enough to sink a roughly 85-acre area on the peak of a mountain above the tunnels where the test likely took placeNorth Korea carries out its nuclear tests in acomplex of tunnels at its Punggye-ri site and images of the mountains in this case Mount Mantap above it can give experts a sense of where the device was tested exactly and how powerful it was  The new Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite images captured before and after Sept 3 showed significant changes at Mount Mantaps peak elevation  Jeffrey Lewis head of the East Asia program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California Before the test Mount Mantap was 2205 meters high the mountain has since diminished in height he addedYou can see that the explosion visibly displaces the mountain which demonstrates both how large the explosion was but also that it occurred in the same tunnel complex as the preceding four nuclear tests Lewis wrote on the  website This is useful because the relationship between the size of the explosion and the magnitude of the seismic signals is sensitive to the overburden  how much rock is above the explosionThe images were taken by Airbus a space technology company that makes earth observation satellites using its TerraSAR-X satellite and were provided to experts at the center You can see the change in this animated image that Lewis posted on TwitterOur friends at  shared radar images of North Koreas nuclear test site showing post-test subsidence  Jeffrey Lewis (@ArmsControlWonk) The device which North Korea described as a hydrogen bomb capable of being placed on a ballistic missile was the most powerful it has tested to date Original estimates had put its yield in the 100-kiloton range but updated seismic data analyzed by experts this week put it closerto a whopping 250 kilotons or nearly 17 times more powerful than the bomb that flattened HiroshimaThe new images are additional proof that the September 2017 explosion was much larger than ever before at this site said Melissa Hanham senior research associate at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies In comparison radar images of last years nuclear test did not show a noticeable change in the surface area of the same mountain she said  The sunken area corresponds with some of the highest peaks of Mount Mantap Hanham saidIt makes sense that they would use their existing tunnel network attached to the North Portal entrance because this leads to where the overburden is the greatest Hanham said If they used a tunnel with less overburden they might have blown the top off the mountainThe growing threat from the north has led to more  A Gallup Korea poll conducted after the Sept 3 test found that 60 percent of respondents supported nuclear weapons for the southBut in an  on Thursday South Korean President Moon Jae-in ruled out the idea To respond to North Korea by having our own nuclear

CEO of Papa Johns theres a straight line from his pizza companys sagging third-quarter earnings through the NFLs national anthem demonstrations to what he says is poor leadership at the top in the NFLThis should have been nipped in the bud a year and a half ago John Schnatter said in prepared remarks (via ) Like many sponsors we are in contact with the NFL and once the issue is resolved between the players and the owners we are optimistic that the NFLs best years are ahead But good or bad leadership starts at the top and this is an example of poor leadershipAlthough he did not name Commissioner Roger Goodell by name Schnatter said that the practice of players kneeling during the anthem to raise awareness of police brutality and social injustice could have been stopped back when Colin Kaepernick began doing it during preseason games in the summer of 2016 Instead players continued to do so in response to violence across the country and President Trump ramped up the

polarizing the countryPapa Johns president and chief operating officer Steve Ritchie said Wednesday (via ) that his company has been the most recognized NFL sponsor for the past two years suggesting that its success is linked to that of the league He said that he expects the earnings decline for Papa Johns to persist until a solution is put in place by the NFL for its player protestsAs  pointed

US military might by pursuing its nuclear weapons program citing recent strikes in Syria and Afghanistan as proof of American strength and resolveThe stark warning delivered in Seoul after the vice president went to the military demarcation line that separates the two Koreas could revive speculation that the White House is considering military action against the regime in PyongyangPence said the Trump administration wants to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons through peaceful means but he repeated the administrations warning that all options are on the tableIn Washington President Trump told CNN at the annual White House Easter Egg Roll that North Korea has got to behaveWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said that Trump would not be drawing red lines in the sand with North KoreaHe holds his cards close to the vest and I think youre not going to see him telegraphing how hes going to respond to any military or other situation going forward Spicer said I think that the action that he took in Syria shows that when appropriate this president will take decisive actionSpicer later cautioned reporters not to make too much of an analogy between Syria and North KoreaA State Department official said Monday that the United States will continue trying to further isolate North Korea economically politically and diplomatically The pressure will keep ratcheting up until Pyongyang stops conducting missile tests and demonstrates that it is willing to engage in negotiations said Susan Thornton the acting assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific affairsWere looking for some kind of signal that they realize the current status quo is unsustainable she said They have to make a final decision about getting rid of illegal programs in order to turn the page and have a more normal relationship with the international communityWe have not seen that signal she addedPence arrived in South Korea just hours after North Korea   which exploded within a few seconds  and amid  in North Korea during which the regime showed off what appeared to be new missiles designed to reach the United StatesThere during a  between North and South Korea and later in remarks to journalists he issued strong warnings to PyongyangJust in the past two weeks the world witnessed the strength and resolve of our new president in actions taken in Syria and Afghanistan Pence said after delivering a statement to the news media alongside Hwang Kyo-ahn South Koreas acting president Neither took questionsNorth Korea would do well not to test his resolve or the strength of the armed forces of the United States in this region Pence said   Earlier this month on Trumps command the US military  in retaliation for a chemical attack that killed scores of civiliansThen less than a week later the US military   the largest non-nuclear bomb ever used in combat by the United States  on Islamic State forces in eastern AfghanistanWith Kim Jong Uns regime conducting a steady stream of ballistic missile launches and signs of activity around its nuclear test site the Trump administration has raised the rhetoric on possible military action to stop it in its tracksBut any strikes against the North would probably bring the United States into a diplomatic crisis with China the Norths main economic lifelineIn Beijing Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang called for international talks with North Korea to ease tensionsRussia too warned that the Trump administration was on what Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called a very risky pathI hope there will be no unilateral actions like those we saw recently in Syria Lavrov told reporters in Moscow Secretary of State Rex Tillerson who visited South Korea last month and Pence have stated that strategic patience  the Obama-era policy of putting pressure on North Korea and waiting for it to return to negotiations  is over and that military action is an option to make North Korea desistThe US Navys decision to  destined for Australia to the western Pacific sparked speculation it was heading to the Korean Peninsula adding to the jitters in the regionThe strike group left Singapore on April 8 Photos released by the Navy on Saturday showed that the carrier passed north through the Sunda Strait the passage between the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java  about 3500 miles from the Korean Peninsula  The Navy declined to give The Washington Post a more precise location than the western Pacific except to rule out the waters around South Korea or JapanAs our secretary of defense made clear here in South Korea not that long ago Pence said Monday we will defeat any attack and we will meet any use of conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective responseDefense Secretary Jim Mattis visited Seoul in February   Hwang the acting president until the election to replace Park Geun-hye said South Korea would ensure the early deployment and operation of an American-backed anti-ballistic missile system called Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) The plan has been controversial in South Korea with some worried that it would make the South more of a target for North Korean missiles and others concerned about economic revenge being exacted by ChinaThe  in a snap presidential election to be held May 9 progressive politician Moon Jae-in has promised to review the previous governments decision to host THAAD   Beijing strongly objects to the antimissile system because it worries that the United States will use its batteries associated radar to snoop on China China has imposed a painful economic boycott on South Korean exports and is making life difficult for South Korean companies in ChinaPence said the United States will press ahead with the THAAD deployment and chastised China for its efforts to put pressure on South Korea to change its mindThe United States is troubled by Chinas economic retaliation against South Korea for taking appropriate steps to defend itself he said The better path would be for China to address the North Korean threat that is actually making such defensive measures necessaryWhile issues like [THAAD] remain the president and I have great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea but as President Trump made clear just a few short days ago if China is unable to deal with North Korea the United States and our allies will the vice president said  Carol Morello John Wagner and Brian Murphy in Washington contributed to this reportSince July when David Collie was shot and paralyzed in a Fort Worth apartment complex  went this way An officer shot Collie after he threatened officers with a box cutterBut Collies attorney released video from a police vehicle dashboard camera this week that he says backs up the paralyzed mans assertions That there was no blade in Collies hand and that he was never a threat to officersThe video is nearly 10 minutes long but the encounter that left Collie paralyzed happens in the first 30 secondsA Fort Worth police officer and a Tarrant County Sheriffs deputy came across Collie as they worked off-duty at an apartment complex They suspected Colliehad been involved in a nearby gas station robbery that ended when two shirtless black men sprinted away from the sceneThe law enforcement officers encountered ashirtless Collie a few minutes later at the apartment complex which is a half-mile away from the gas stationAccording to the video he walked away from the approaching officersThey are seen getting out of their vehicle to engage him One has a flashlight The other unholsters a pistolAt some point Collie points  his attorney says hes pointing toward his girlfriends apartment where he was headed  and the officer fires one shotCollie collapses in a heap  Collie is now paralyzed from the abdomen down his attorney said The 33-year-old will likely require medical care for the rest of his lifeHis assertion is [he] was only trying to comply Nate Washington Collies attorney told The Washington Post These officers pulled up theyre moving kind of quickly one of them has a gun drawnHe told me I was scared I wasnt exactly sure what to do When I met him in the

emerge after Texas police shoot black man | by  David Collie a young black man   KnowYourRightsCamp (@yourrightscamp) He wants to see the officer who shot him fired from the force and charged with a crimeFort Worth police did not respond to messages seeking comment about Collies case on WednesdayA police spokesman  that until the internal case is closed we are unable to release more details The case against the officer has not yet been presented to a grand jury the spokesman saidThe police department is already reeling from a viral video this month that showed a white officer scolding a mom who had called 911 to report an assault on her son   and her teenage daughtersTexas officials and many in the public were outraged at the video which shows the officer pointing his stun gun at the teenagers Many called for the officer to be firedThe Fort Worth Police Department didnt releasea statement directly addressing Collies shooting video or the other incidentBut the department posted a tweet shortly after Washington released the videoWe saw what you saw We heard what you heard We have received your phone calls your emails your messages your tweets your reviews your absolute concern over what occurred and your demand for answers and action the tweet says WE DO HEAR YOU  Collies shooting happened as police across the United States and the communities they serve are mired in a debate about whether officers are too quick to use deadly force against minorities According to The Washington Posts police shooting database 951 people have been shot and killed by officers in 2016 Of those 228 were black nearly one out of every fourWashington said he believes racial bias was at play in Collies caseIt is the sort of racial bias and the sort of racial prejudice that says you should be afraid of the African American man Washington said You watch that video you have an officer that sees Mr Collie and within 10 seconds puts a bullet in his backThat doesnt happen to other folks That happens to African AmericansDonald Trumps highly personal racially tinged attacks on a federal judge overseeing a pair of lawsuits against him have set off a wave of alarm among legal experts who worry that the Republican presidential candidates vendetta signals a remarkable disregard for judicial independenceThat attitude many argue could carry constitutional implications if Trump becomes presidentUS District Judge Gonzalo Curiel who is handling two class-action lawsuits against Trump University in San Diego has emerged as a central target for Trump and his supporters in recent weeks The enmity only escalated after Curiel ordered the release of embarrassing internal documents detailing predatory marketing practices at the for-profit educational venture that case is set to go to trial after the November electionI have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump a hater Hes a hater Trump said at a campaign rally in San Diego adding that he believed the Indiana-born judge was MexicanHe also suggested taking action against the judge after the election They ought to look into Judge Curiel because what Judge Curiel is doing is a total disgrace Okay But we will come back in November Wouldnt that be wild if I am president and come back and do a civil case Where everybody likes it Okay This is called life folksThe courtroom proceedings come with high stakes for Trump whose likely tough general-election fight against Hillary Clinton will leave him open to intense scrutiny of his character business practices and temperament Clinton said Wednesday that the Trump University allegations are just more evidence that Donald Trump himself is a fraudTrumps strikingly personal attacks on Curiel are highly unusual and have prompted questions about how he would react to adverse judicial decisions should he become president Trumps remarks also stand out because he has a personal financial stake in the caseHaving a presidential candidate embroiled in litigation totally unrelated to the political system  that is what is so novel about this And then you add to this the personal criticism said Arthur Hellman a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh Its personal all the way and thats what makes this different Conflicts between the courts and the political branches are common and to some degree expected The Constitution mandates lifetime tenure for federal judges who serve in good behavior and protects them against recrimination by forbidding that their salaries be diminishedJudicial appointments are among a presidents most lasting legacies and in the current presidential campaign candidates from both parties have gone beyond the comfort level of many legal experts by issuing litmus tests On the Democratic side Clinton and Sen Bernie Sanders (Vt) have said overturning the Supreme Courts controversial ruling should be a priority while Republican candidates went after Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr for his votes upholding the Affordable Care ActPresident Obama prompted outrage among conservatives in 2010 when he blasted the ruling in his State of the Union address Republican members of Congress criticized the president for attacking the decision with members of the court seated just feet away from him while Democrats defended the comments as within the bounds of policy debateTrumps attacks on Curiel stand out for their personal nature for the racial remarks and for the suggestion by a potential president that someone ought to look into the judgeCharles Gardner Geyh a professor at Indiana Universitys Maurer School of Law said he has no problem with presidents or presidential candidates criticizing judges or judicial decisions But he said theres a line between disagreement and sort of throwing the judiciary under the bus that I think is at issue hereOne of Trumps earlier jeremiads came in February when he told Fox News that Curiel was biased against him because of his controversial immigration comments and proposals including his promises to build a giant wall on the US-Mexico border and deport 11million illegal immigrantsI think it has to do with perhaps the fact that Im very very strong on the border Trump said then Now he is Hispanic I believe He is a very hostile judge to meTrump returned to ethnicity at last weeks San Diego rally where he erroneously suggested Curiel was from Mexico The judge who happens to be we believe Mexican which is great I think thats fine You know what I think the Mexicans are going to end up loving Donald Trump when I give all these jobs okayCuriel who through his office declined to comment  and is a 1979 graduate of the Indiana University law school He gained acclaim prosecuting drug traffickers along the Tijuana corridor and was reportedly targeted for assassination by the Felix cartel he joined the federal bench in 2012 after being nominated by ObamaKatrina Pierson a spokeswoman for Trump has expanded on the accusations of bias wrongly suggesting Curiel is part of a group organizing protests at Trump rallies around California Curiel is a member of the San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association a professional group that she appeared to confuse with the National Council of La Raza an advocacy groupLuis Osuna the president of the lawyers association said the group is not an advocacy group and supports candidates on both sides of the aisle He said Trumps attempts to discredit Curiel should give voters serious pause not least because his comments reduce Hispanics in the legal profession to their heritageEvery time there is a comment like this it is disheartening Osuna said It is not unfortunately surprising given the source of the comments But it displays a complete lack of understanding of the role that we have as attorneys and judges and the role that we have in upholding the ConstitutionHes definitely using it as a dog whistle to his supporters he added Obviously I dont know what is in his heart I can only judge based on the way he has acted in the past but this has been a recurring theme in his campaignTrump is not without recourse if he thinks that Curiel has engaged in misconduct Russell Wheeler a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution said Trump could file a complaint with the federal court of appeals He said Trump would have to provide evidence that Curiel was biased in his behavior against the real estate mogul and could then proceed with a disqualification motion Wheeler said Trump could also ask Curiel to recuse himself from the case because of a lack of impartiality If Curiel declined Trump could file an appeal  But Wheeler added that based on what he has seen Curiel has been nothing but fair in this case As part of the ongoing class-action lawsuit against Trump University that he is overseeing Curiel ordered the release of internal documents that showed Trump played a key role in the marketing for the business and how staff members were guided to push customers to purchase expensive follow-ups costing up to $35000 after taking free introductory courses The order came in response to a request by The Washington Post which argued that Trumps presidential bid made the documents a matter of public interest In the order Curiel said that Trump had placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue  Robert Barnes contributed to this reportA majority of Americans say President Trump has not accomplished much during his first ninemonths in office and they have delivered a report card that is far harsher even than the tepid expectations they set for his tenure when he was sworn into office according to a new Approaching the first anniversary of his victory over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election Trump has an approval rating demonstrably lower than any previous chief executive at this point in his presidency over sevendecades of polling Fewer than 4in 10 Americans  37 percent  say they approve of the way he is handling his job Trumps approval rating has changed little over the past fourmonths which have included tumultuous events from hurricanes to legislative setbacks to indictments in special counsel Robert S Mueller IIIs investigation into the role Russia played in the 2016campaign   The presidents disapproval rating has reached 59 percent with 50 percent saying they strongly disapprove of the job he is doing While little changed since the summer both represent the worst marks of his presidency   He is the only president dating back to Harry S Truman whose approval rating at this point in his presidency is net negative  by 22points The next worst recorded in that time was Bill Clinton who had a net positive of 11 points by this time in his presidencyTrump began his presidency with only modest expectations on the part of a public that was divided coming out of last years contentious election Roughly 100days into his presidency 42 percent said he had accomplished a great deal or a good amount while in office Today that has declined to 35 percent Meanwhile 65 percent say he has accomplished not much or little or nothing This is up from 56 percent last spring Forty-threepercent of all Americans give him the lowest possible rating saying he has accomplished little or nothing At the 100-day mark of Trumps presidency last spring Americans were split almost evenly on the question of whether he was keeping most of his major campaign promises with 44 percent saying he was and 41 percent disagreeing Today the verdict is more severe with a majority (55 percent) saying he is not keeping most of those promisesThe public sees Democrats acting mostly as an opposition party rather than offering ideas of their own Asked whether the Democratic Party is presenting alternatives to Trumps proposals or mainly criticizing the president 61 percent said mainly criticizing identical to the percentage who said this of Republican Party leaders one year after Obamas election Only a plurality of Democrats (47 percent) say their leaders are offering alternatives to Trumps ideasTrumps actions and behavior have drawn sharp criticism from a few members of his own party most recently from Sens Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake and John McCain of Arizona Former president George W Bush delivered a recent speech that while never mentioning Trump by name was seen as a rebuke of the way the president is conducting himself in officeThe Post-ABC News poll asked self-identified Republicans and independents who lean toward the GOP whether they believed their party leaders should speak out when they disagree with the president Overall 71 percent said they should with just 27 percent saying those leaders should avoid criticizing him including 65 percent of Trump voters who say Republicans should air their disagreementsOn four key issues Trump has not matched the early expectations for his presidency and today majorities  in some case strong majorities  give him negative reviews Those issues are the economy dealing with race relations improving the health-care system and dealing with the threat of terrorism (Part of this survey was conducted before the terrorist attack on Tuesday that left eight people dead in NewYork)The president has pointed to what he sees as significant accomplishments in the area of the economy with the stock market at record levels unemployment at 41 percent  a 17-year low  and growth in the two most recent quarters at 3 percent But the public gives him little credit for the state of the economy Last January 61 percent offered a positive assessment when asked how they thought he would handle the economy Today 44 percent give him positive marks while 53 percent say he has not done wellIn January a majority (56 percent) said they believed he would do an excellent or good job dealing with threats of terrorism Today 43 percent give him positive reviewsTrump receives even lower ratings on race and health care Fewer than 3 in 10 say he has done a good job dealing with race relations which is 12 points below the 40 percent who said in January they thought he would handle race issues effectively Half of all Americans say they believe Trump is biased against black people and slightly more (55 percent) say he is biased against womenThe racial assessment follows a backlash to Trumps comments about the white supremacist rally in August in Charlottesville where marchers chanted Nazi slogans and the ensuing violence left one woman dead and others injured Two state police officers also died when their helicopter crashed after assisting in the unrest Trump was slow to condemn the marchers and at one point said there were very fine people among the neo-Nazi demonstrators In January 44 percent said they expected him to handle the issue of health care effectively including 87 percent of Republicans Optimism has faded sharply with 26 percent of Americans and 59 percent of Republicans giving him positive marks today The overall percentage offering a negative assessment has jumped from 51 percent in January to 70percent today including 47percent who give him the lowest rating poorPolitical independents have soured the most considering Trumps pre-inaugural expectations and current ratings The percentage of independents saying Trump is doing a good job on the economy race relations and health care is more than 20 points lower than the percentage that expected him to perform well in January On terrorism todays ratings are 17 points below early expectations among independents Congressional Republicans were stymied in their efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act despite years of promises to do so The House after first failing to pass a bill eventually approved a measure and sent it to the Senate Senate Republican leaders struggled to get a health bill to the floor for consideration When they did they fell short of the necessary majority needed to keep the process movingThroughout that process Trump prodded the Republican leadership principally Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) with demeaning tweets demanding action Ever since the effort broke down Trump has attempted to focus the ire of disappointed conservatives on those congressional Republicans but the failed effort also appears to have taken a toll on him A solid majority (59 percent) also see Trump as trying to make the federal health law fail Less than one-tenth of the public says they support those efforts to scuttle the law through executive actions while overall 50 percent of the public opposes what they see as Trump undermining the existing programAs tensions mount over North Koreas pursuit of a nuclear weapon and delivery system capable of hitting the United States the public has little trust in the president to handle the problem responsibly A majority (51 percent) say they trust him not at all on this national security issue and 16 percent say they trust him just some Meanwhile 32percent say they trust him a great deal or a good amountOther measures highlight the degree to which Trump is governing with the support of a minority of the population Four in 10 say he is a strong leader Thats 13points below the level in April On this question he has gone from a net positive of eight points to a net negative of 19 points Roughly twice as many Americans say that under Trump US leadership in the world has gotten weaker rather than stronger 53 to 26 percent Trump campaigned on his dealmaking ability but the public doubts his ability to forge political agreements Almost 6 in 10 say he is not good at making political deals while under 4 in 10 say he is good at making dealsOnethird say he is honest and trustworthy down only marginally since April On the question of whether he has the temperament and personality needed to serve as president 31 percent say yes while 66 percent say no That is the lowest since August 2016 when candidate Trump was embroiled in a controversy with a Gold Star familyA minority of 37 percent say he understands the problems of people like you unchanged since last spring while 42 percent say he has brought needed change to Washington marginally better than when last measured twomonths agoOf those Americans who say they voted in 2016 46 percent say they supported Clinton and 43percent say they backed Trump If an election were held today with the same candidates 40 percent of those 2016 voters say they would back Trump and 40percent say they would support Clinton Trump has succeeded in satisfying voters who elected him president but few others Voters who supported Trump continue to be overwhelmingly supportive with 91 percent approving of his performance including 69 percent strongly A still larger 95 percent of Clinton voters disapprove of him with 88 percent who feel that way strongly Among those who supported neither candidate  or did not vote  24 percent approve of Trump while 68 percent disapprove The  was conducted Oct 29 to Nov 1

political leaders focused on the economy as campaigning for this months snap election began Tuesday with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe urging voters to give him more time to work on the recovery while a new rival party vowed to scrap a planned consumption tax increaseBut the Oct22 election is shaping up to be much less of a competition than many had hoped  or feared  as Yuriko Koike head of the new party and the populist governor of Tokyo decided against running for parliament effectively taking herself out of the race to become prime ministerKoike a former defense minister in Abes government started the Party of Hope last month specifically to compete against the ruling Liberal Democratic Party although there are few policy differences between themIts a politicians job to give people hope and dreams We will restore peoples trust in politics Koike told potential voters outside a Tokyo train station Tuesday She urged voters to help her party end Abe-dominant politics  Even as campaigning began Tuesday some analysts thought Koike would still throw her hat in the ring as a candidate for parliament before the 5pm deadlineBut she did not instead urging voters to back her party even without her The hastily formed Party of Hope which incorporates some lawmakers from the flailing opposition Democratic Party now appears leaderless without an obvious candidate for prime ministerA poll by public broadcaster NHK published Tuesday offered a devastating prognosis for Koikes party putting support for it at 48percent compared with 312percent for Abes LDPKoikes decision not to run for parliament as the leader of her party shows that it appears to be less a nascent second major party and more a vehicle for a Koike vendetta against Abe said Tobias Harris an analyst at Teneo Intelligence a consultancyAbe for his part started campaigning in Fukushima the prefecture that was the site of the  where he said he was not interested in political fads or slogansIn this election we will promote our policies honestly and earnestly he said vowing to press ahead with a planned increase in the consumption tax from 8percent to 10percent but promising to use the money for child care and educationAbe who has been in power for almost five years dissolved the lower house of the Diet or parliament last month and  14months ahead of schedule to capitalize on a sudden bounce in his poll numbersThe conservative prime minister had seen his  at the beginning of the summer amid corruption allegations but North Koreas flurry of missile launches and its  helped restore Abes fortunes  Abe said he wanted a new mandate to crack down on North Korea a point he repeated Tuesday This election will determine how we should deal with the threat he said in Fukushima We must continue to apply pressureBut some analysts say the hard-line prime ministers real aim is to win a new mandate and use it to make progress on his top political goal revising the US-written postwar constitution to allow Japan to return to normal military footing after seven decades of imposed pacifismAlthough the Party of Hope had little chance of taking control of the lower house of the Diet it had looked set to imperil Abes two-thirds majority which he needs to push through constitutional changesThe most important factor now Harris wrote in a research note is turnout Record-low turnout in 2012 and 2014 helped Abe win landslide victories so Koikes party and other opposition parties will have to motivate voters if they want to thwart himSeparately Tuesday a district court in Fukushima ordered the Japanese government and the Tokyo Electric Power Co the nuclear plant operator to pay $44million in damages over the 2011 triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plantThe class-action suit was brought by about 3800 plaintiffs and is the largest of about 30 suits filed against the authorities after the disaster which was triggered by a huge earthquake and tsunami that overwhelmed the plantPresident Trump on Wednesday defended Fox News host Bill OReilly a longtime friend facing a  following a that he and the cablenetwork have collectively paid $13 million over the years to settle lawsuits brought by women alleging sexual harassment or inappropriate conductI think hes a person I know well  he is a good person Trump  during an interview at the White House He added I dont think Bill did anything wrongActually the president does think OReilly did  wrong Hereis Trumps lone criticism I think he shouldnt have settled personally I think he shouldnt have settled Because you should have taken it all the wayOReilly said over the weekend that he settled the lawsuits not because he was guilty he denies wrongdoing but to spare his children the pain of messy public ordealsTrump is disappointed in his pals unwillingness to fight harder but not in anything elseTrump is returning a favor here Late in the presidential campaign when The Washington Post  in which Trump boasted that he could do anything to women and get away with it because he is a star OReilly dismissively told viewers that the remarks were just crude guy talkOReilly also expressed skepticism when a  in the final month of the race claiming that Trump had touched them inappropriatelyRegarding other matters OReilly was  as I wrote in SeptemberHe  for retweeting a phony statistic about black-on-white homicide  to bar all foreign Muslims from entering the United States and told Trump that rounding up and deporting every last undocumented immigrant could never happenBut OReilly never seemed to take Trumps accusers seriously and now Trump is doing the same for OReillyOn some level it is nice to have the backing of the president of the United States On another level OReilly might reasonably worry that Trumps support is a kiss of deathI think they are unfounded Trump on July 14 discussing sexual harassment allegations against Fox Newss then-chairman Roger Ailes another longtime friendAiles  one week laterFive months before unveiling his tax plan President Trump claimed that it is the biggest tax cut in history This is bigger than Reagan  This is actually bigger than Reagan tax cuts We warned readers at the time that there was no public proposal yet and that this was a dubious claim properly measured as a percentage of the nations gross domestic productTrump would repeat this misleading claim 16 more times before he actually revealed his plan to the public Sept 27 In fact the 16th time he said it was during remarks before traveling to Indiana for the speech Were going right now to Indiana Were going to introduce a tax plan thats the largest tax cut essentially in the history of our countryYet nothing in the plan revealed that day offered clarity as to how it was the largest tax cut in our countrys history Instead he outlined four still-somewhat-vague proposals while repeating some golden-oldie false or misleading facts about taxes which we fact-checkedThis tendency of Trump is all too familiar to The Fact Checker He is quick to makeclaims full of superlatives  the greatest this and the most beautiful that  with little to no empirical evidence to support them Trump proposed deep tax cuts but so far he has released only a nine-page framework that would start negotiations with lawmakers Yet since five months ago he flatly proclaimed his planis actually bigger than Reagan tax cutsThe Fact Checker has completed two-thirds of our year-long project analyzing categorizing and tracking every false or misleading claim by Trump as well as his flip-flops As of our latest update Oct 10 2017 or his 264th day in office the president has made 1318 claims over 263 days He has averagedfive claims a dayeven picking up pace since the six-month mark()When you track Trumps claims so closely it can often feel like deja vu Trump has a tendency to repeat himself and that includes his false or misleading claims (For an overview of his most frequently repeated claims see  from Augustwhen Trump surpassed the 1000-claim mark)With almost exactly 100 days left to go in our year-long project Trump is inching ever closer to breaking 2000 claimsMany of Trumps most frequent claims in the past month were about taxes He repeatedly claimed that the United States pays the highest corporate taxes or that it is the highest-taxed nation The latter is false the former is misleading as the effective US corporate tax rate (what companies end up paying after deductions and benefits) end up being lower than the statutory tax rateTrump now claims that between $3 trillion and $5 trillion perhaps even more of profits are held overseas by US companies There is no official statistic as Trump notes but his high-end figure appears to be an exaggeration The Internal Revenue Service in 2012 said the figure was $23 trillion and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that it had risen to $26 trillion in 2015 There are other estimates as well but none top $28 trillionSince our last update we saw a surge of brand-new claims about hurricanes and the National Football League In the past month twodestructive hurricanes hit Florida and Puerto Rico and Trump pushed for NFL players to be penalized for protesting police brutality and racial inequality during the national anthemTrump repeatedly got basic facts wrong about Hurricane Irma in Florida and Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico He claimed they made landfall as Category 5 storms  the most destructive kind  but they touched down as Category 4 and eventually reached Category 5 strength How strong a hurricane is when it makes landfall and then how much strength it gains or loses is an important distinction for weather disastersTrump exaggerated the progress of the federal governments relief efforts in Puerto Rico the number of lives saved by the Coast Guard in after Hurricane Harvey in Texas and the maximum wind speed of Hurricane MariaTrumpoften made false or exaggerated claims in his attacks against the NFL He claimed multiple times that NFL ratings are down massively and going way down because of the players protests during the national anthem before the game beginsBut this lacks context The TV audience size for NFL games is down this year but its unclear exactly why Average attendance at regular season NFL games last year was the highest since 2007 when the NFL set an record in attendance The NFL says ticket sales are on par with last year according to the Associated Press And professional football games remain among the most-watched televised events the AP reportedTrump also repeatedly said the NFL protest has nothing to do with race But players and coaches who defended the protests said it was over racial injustice Trump blamed the NFL for not enforcing a rule thats been in existence for a long time requiring players to stand for the anthem But it turns out it wasnt a rule the NFL said players are encouraged but not required to stand for the national anthem and that teams can use discretionFinally in the past month we saw the return of a curious talking point As Trump publicly criticized Secretary of State Rex Tillersons approach to confronting the growing North Korean nuclear threat Trump bemoaned the lack of progress made in denuclearizing North Korea over the past 25 yearsIn April Trump claimedthat since President Bill Clinton every president has been outplayed by this gentleman referring to North Koreas Kim Jong-Un Then recently Trump again made it seem likeRocket Man  his nickname for Kim  was in charge since ClintonOf course thats not the caseIt was misleading as three different leaders (Kim his father Kim Jong-il and grandfather Kim Il-sung) have led North Korea since Clintons presidency Kim is one of the most common Korean surnamesTurns out this was an instance where Trump glossed over key details to the point of inaccuracy another Trump tendency with whichThe Fact Checker is quite familiarDuring an Oct 7 2017interview with former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee (R) Trump acknowledged that there are three different Kims but they have the same attitude Trump added about Kim Jong-Un I think this ones the worst of the groupSo mystery solved on the Kim front Still we are eager to get to the bottom of another head-scratcher Whether Trumps tax plan is the biggest tax cut in US history When the details are finally revealed Trumps track record so far suggests his claim will once again fall short()President Trump began recasting Americas role in the global economy Monday canceling an agreement for a sweeping trade deal with Asia that he once called a potential disasterTrump signed the executive order formally ending the United States participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the Oval Office after discussing American manufacturing with business leaders in the Roosevelt Room The order was largely symbolic  the deal was already essentially dead in Congress  but served to signal that Trumps tough talk on trade during the campaign will carry over to his new administrationTrump did not directly address the North American Free Trade Agreement on Monday as he had promised during the election However he repeated his threat to punish US companies that build factories overseas and ship products back home  a charge he has primarily leveled at automakers with operations in Mexico And his hard-line opening stance could portend a contentious renegotiation of the 22-year-old deal with Mexico and Canada that Trumps senior advisers have called a top priority for the new administrationThis abrupt action so early in the Trump administration puts the world on notice that all of Americas traditional economic and political alliances are now open to reassessment and renegotiation said Eswar Prasad trade policy professor at Cornell University This could have an adverse long-run impact on the ability of the US to maintain its influence and leadership in world economic and political affairs  The TPP was one of former president Barack Obamas signature efforts part of a broader strategy to increase American clout in Asia and provide a check on Chinas economic and military ambitions Several of the executives Trump met with Monday initially had supported the agreement while the chief architect of the administrations trade policy Commerce secretary nominee Wilbur Ross was also once a booster for the dealBut ending TPP was one of the clarion calls of Trumps campaign part of a global backlash against the drive toward greater internationalization that has defined the world economy since the end of World War II British Prime Minister Theresa May who is in the midst of navigating her countrys own break from established trading partners is slated to visit with Trump later this week A White House spokesman said meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto are in the worksWhat we want is fair trade Trump said during his meeting with executives And were gonna treat countries fairly but they have to treat us fairlySince the election TPP has become politically toxic in both parties On Monday five Democratic senators introduced legislation that would require the president to notify each of the 11 other countries involved in the deal of the United States withdrawal It would also block any so-called fast track approval of the agreement in the future AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka hailed the presidents executive order and called for additional actionThey are just the first in a series of necessary policy changes required to build a fair and just global economy he said in a statementOn Monday Trump highlighted his proposal for a border tax as a centerpiece of the administrations trade policy Dow Chemical Chief Executive Andrew Liveris who was among the business leaders who met with Trump on Monday morning said the border tax was discussed extensively He said the executives were asked to return in 30 days with a plan to shore up the manufacturing industryI would take the president at his word here Liveris said Hes not going to do anything to harm competitiveness Hes going to actually make us all more competitiveStill it remains unclear exactly how a border tax would be implemented Testifying before the Senate finance committee last week Trumps nominee to lead the Treasury Department said any border tax would be targeted at specific businesses However the president does not have the power to levy taxes and international trade experts have warned singling out companies could violate existing treaties  House Speaker Paul D Ryan has proposed allowing businesses that export goods to deduct many of their expenses while those that import would not receive the same benefit But in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal Trump dismissed the plan known as border adjustment as too complicatedEconomists have warned that many of Trumps proposals  including suggestions that he would impose blanket double-digit tariffs on goods from Mexico and China  could backfire on the American economy by causing prices to rise or igniting a trade war And business groups such as the US Chamber of Commerce had lobbied extensively for passage of TPP touting the deal as an engine of job growth and an important check on Chinas growing ambitionsTPP withdrawal will slow US [economic] growth cost American jobs & weaken US standing in Asia/world said Richard Haas president of the Council on Foreign Relations said in a tweet early Monday China could well be principal beneficiaryBut other industry groups argued that Trumps approach would better leverage Americas status as the worlds largest economy Scott Paul president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing said his group is hoping that opening up NAFTA could provide more leeway to combat currency manipulation in countries outside the agreement His group which represents both industry and unions is also seeking more stringent rules of origin that dictate how much production must occur with member countries to qualify for free trade statusThe details are going to matter a lot Paul said Renegotiating NAFTA obviously entails some risks and some rewardsWe have been tracking President Trumps false or misleading claims for more than seven months Somewhere around Aug 4 or Aug 5 he broke 1000 claims and the tally now stands at 1057 ()Thats an impressive number by any standard In fact we are a little late with this update because we have simply been overwhelmed keeping track of the  made by the president in the later part of July Things slowed down during the presidentsworking vacation so we have finally been able to catch upAt the presidents current pace he averages nearly fiveclaims a day Many are repeats of claims that have been previously debunked We also include statements that are unacknowledged flip-flops from previously held positions such as touting new highs in a stock market that he previously derided as being a big fat bubbleMore than 30 of the presidents misleading statements have been repeated three or more timesTrumps most repeated claim uttered 50 times was some variation of the statement that the Affordable Care Act is dying and essentially dead The Congressional Budget Office has said that the Obamacare exchanges despite well-documented issues are not imploding and are expected to remain stable for the foreseeable future Moreover Congress has been unable to pass a law that would repeal Obamacare making the continuation of the law Trumps problemTrump repeatedly takes credit for events or business decisions that happened before he took the oath of office  or had even been elected Forty-two times he has touted that  that had been previously announced and could easily be found with a Google search And 19 times he has boasted that he achieved  even though the price cut had been in the works before he was electedBut some of the presidents repeated claims have nothing to do with policy but instead rehash discredited campaign rhetoric such as the false charge that Hillary Clinton  or that  Both claims were deemed Four-Pinocchios false in 2016 Yet Trump brought them up 11 timesSome of Trumps favorite claims are simply odd Eleven times he has said that the United States has already spent $6 trillion on Middle East wars money that could have been used instead on building roads in the United States He often suggests this is a recently calculated figure but it combines the cost of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (which is actually in South Asia) and then includes future obligations for veterans costs and interest on the debt through 2053At the six-month mark the president was averaging 46 claims a day but he has now increased his pace At his current rate the president wont break 2000 claims in his first year in office But with five months to go all bets are off()In mid-June a group ofwhitestudents at a Christian school in Orlando went onInstagram to debate the bestway to usea racial slurSoI have a questionfor all my fans a rising First Academy junior wrote starting the conversation Everyone contribute even if you wouldntnormally Is it na or n-r  I think na is more respectful and (another student)thinks it isnt supposed to be used as a respectful termSo Like for n-r comment for na Thanks everyoneLater the teen offered ahypothetical situation to explain her thinkingOK Heres a scenario for ya she wrote in the comments Youre driving down the road and u see a group of black people on the sidewalk Do you say n-rs or do you say n-as because to me saying n-rs seems like ur being negative and rude while saying n-s sounds like youre messing around and being sillyThe discussion continued From my experience you should call a na a na only if you are close to that na and u should say my na one person repliedThe public Instagram exchangewent viral last week after New York Daily News reporter Shaun King shared it  and  overshadowingthe start of school at the First Academy where officials say many of the teens involved in the debate are enrolledOn the post there are more than 40 comments from the teen her friends and her followers according to King a journalistand Black Lives Matter activist who posted images of the exchange after somebody sent them to him  Although the Instagram conversation presumablytook place off-campus the school addressed the swelling controversy On Friday  was featured prominently on the First Academy website above enrollment details and the schools mission statementOfficials at the school a ministry of First Baptist Church Orlando have unequivocally denounced the Instagram debate and said the students who participated in itcould face disciplinary actionFirst Academy officials also said the conversation doesnt reflect theprivate schools commitment to inclusion and racial reconciliationTFA is appalled by such inappropriate comments posted by some of our students Steve

TVand I see yet again some college students learning that you cant wear an Afro and blackface to the Halloween partyIts somethingthat should be part of cultural literacy We should be teaching it at high school level tofreshmen and sophomores  America has used the n-word for centuries and debated it for decades It has been used as a strongly negative term of contempt for a black person since at least the 18th century according to the Oxford English dictionaryBut the term has been reclaimedas a term of self-reference the dictionary says in the same way queer has been adopted by some gay and lesbian peopleThe lesson for youths Armour said is that hateful words that have been re-appropriatedby members of an oppressed group cantbe used by outsiders without a whiffof discriminationBlack folks have been on the receiving end of that word the object of it going back hundreds of years Armour said They are in a position to use it with a special sense of irony that someone who isnt black simply cant and everybody sort of understands thatThe First Academy was founded in 1986 as a Christ-centered college preparatory school whose mission is to prepare children for life as Christian

schools Indian students at our schools many African Americans and Africans he said from  on Whitaker the president and the head of school did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment But in his statement on Whitaker said school officials have taken and are taking deliberate steps to address this issue As we reflect on this situation we have realized there is much work to do in the area of racial reconciliation that we must take ownership ofHave we done enough The answer is no However we will continue to learn from this experience and are committed to do the necessary and important work to grow as a school community in this area of racial reconciliationHe added Let me state unequivocally that any comments related to race or culture that are discriminatory in attitude or action will not be tolerated Despite our longstanding tradition of acceptance and inclusivity we remain an imperfect school made up of imperfect people in need of Gods grace and forgivenessThe statement was not the only one released by First Academy officials as the Instagram exchange bounced across social media The school also posted a  authored byBishop Allen WigginsWiggins who is black wrote in his

the schoolWe have no way to verify those are actual students he saidRandall Eggert a linguistics professor at the University of Utah said students in his Bad Words and Taboo Truths class sometimesdispute how inflammatory the n-word isAt the beginning of every semester Eggert asks students to write the worst words they can think of the n-word is always one of the most-listed wordsBut Eggert said some young people influenced by a popular culture that profligately uses the n-word dont find the word to be particularly problematicTheres a shift going on he said Its going to be slow and its going to happen geographically different across the country Theres probably a good chance that people are having this conversation in pockets all across the countryOccasionally in class Eggert said hell come across students who are adamant that people shouldnt get offended if they dont use the word in a racially charged wayIts as though their freedom has been infringed upon when they told that they cant say the word They get hostile about it Eggert said Undoubtedly its a bit of white privilege its the one thing that we cant have so you want to grab itexpounded on the cultural shift in the n-words useAs Dave Sheinin and Krissah Thompson wroteIt is the very notion of banning the n-word that appears dead and fit for burial It was a long and noble fight waged largely  but not exclusively  by an older generation for which the word is inseparable from the brutality into which it was born If there is still a meaningful n-word debate left to have it is over context ownership and the degree to which it should be tethered to its awful history  or set free from itA word that is used 500000 times a day on Twitter  as na is according to search data on the social media analytics Web site Topsycom  is almost by definition beyond banning By comparison bro and dude  two of the terms with which the n-word is synonymous to many people younger than 35  are used 300000 and 200000 times respectively For many of this generation the word is tossed around unthinkingly no more impactful than a commaWASHINGTON  When in Asia make sure handshakes arent too long  or short Dont bobble names or titles Stifle the critical tweets Dont question the foodThese points of etiquette and protocol are part of the regions core culture known as face  keeping yours helping others save theirs In many ways they are the opposite of President Donald Trumps impulsive in-your-face style And hes not expected to soften it even in the shadow of North Korea with whom hes rattled sabers about fire and fury and nuclear war The president will use whatever language he wants to use National Security Adviser HR McMaster told reporters Thursday on the eve of Trumps 12-day tour through South Korea China Vietnam and the Philippines I dont think the president really modulates his language Have you noticedSo much for the prospects of Trump and the finer points of protocol during the trip on which hell be toting a hefty economic and national security agenda But hell have a squad of White House and State Department officials guiding the way on other more logistical matters in the ancient discipline of choreographing everything  from how a room is set up to who stands where  and avoiding embarrassments One of the things with protocol is obviously to do no harm Sean P Lawler Trumps nominee to be to be US chief of protocol said Wednesday before the Senate committee considering his confirmation As the director of visits and diplomacy for the National Security Council he will accompany Trump on the trip We are the bridge said Capricia Marshall President Barack Obamas chief of protocol from 2009 to 2013Protocol experts say American informality frequently gets lost in translation in the traditional cultures Trump will be visitingOn Wednesday Trump showed signs of understanding the sensitivity Even as he complained during a Cabinet meeting about bad trade deals and deficits including with China Trump was restrained I dont want to embarrass anybody four days before I land in China Trump said before adding But its horribleAmong the challenges Trump faces as he heads to Asia are the complexities of the Asian face a concept thats foreign to many Americans but lies at the foundation of societies across the regionGenerally it means making sure behavior posture gestures remarks and more do not spark strong negative emotions in others or oneselfSo for example Trumps 19 seconds of shaking patting and yanking the hand of Japans leader at the White House in February crossed all kinds of cultural lines Prime Minister Shinzo Abe responded with an on-camera eye roll as Trump looked away Trump is playing golf with Abe during the trip according to White House officialsNames and titles are important in AsiaIn July the Trump White House issued a news release that called Chinese President Xi Jinping the leader of the Republic of China Xi is the president of the Peoples Republic of China Taiwan calls itself the Republic of China China said it received an apology from the USThen theres Trumps fondness for using Twitter to respond to comments he doesnt like  bing bing bing as he told Fox Business Network this month In Asia doing that in real time could offend the regions cultural aversion to confrontation I think you will find that they are very sensitive to slights said Georgetown University professor Dennis Wilder who formerly served on the National Security Council He cautions Trump against any kind of tweeting that would criticize the leader of a country hes visiting I think this can go well but he just needs to understand that face in East Asian cultures is terribly important and he needs to make sure that he gives face to the other leadersParticularly in China a breach of protocol can affect the content of the meeting according to Peter Selfridge the most recent holder of the chief of protocol post from 2013 to Trumps inauguration in January The Chinese appreciate precision when it comes to formal diplomatic engagements said Selfridge Americans certainly welcome this as well but are perhaps more accepting of improvisation and can even use it to their advantageTrump wouldnt be the first US leader to commit a protocol faux pas in AsiaIn 2014 local bloggers huffed that Obama looked like an idler or a rapper when he turned down a chauffeured ride to the Asia Pacific Economic Conference in Beijing and arrived in his own more-secure presidential limo and was chewing gum as he was known to do to fight nicotine cravingsTrump might consider advice from his predecessors if he finds he is served something other than his favorite steak with ketchupRichard Nixon the first president to open the diplomatic door to China advised Ronald Reagan on a 1984 trip there Dont ask about the food just swallow it Still I had difficulty identifying several items on my plate that first night Reagan wrote in his

percent of that 99 percent that comes in Karasik saidSupermarkets in Qatarwere already busy because ofRamadan but the local website Doha News reported that the crowds Monday were even bigger than usualIve never seen anything like it  people have trolleys full of food and water one resident Stores are busy enough in   during Ramadan But  border closures and looming food shortages are an even crazier scene  Allison Furlong (@AllisonFurlong) The full extent of the disruption may not be evident for a while though Al Jazeera has reported that food trucks are being stopped at the Saudi-Qatar borderA statement from the Qatari cabinet played down the risk of food shortages and warned against panic buying We took all the necessary precautions to ensure normal life the statement Food security has long been an issue in Persian Gulf states many of which import up to 90 percent of their food A number of gulf countries have sought to reach land deals with other countries to grow food Qatar  with Kenya to lease 40000 hectares of land in return for a $25 billion loan almost 10 years ago Karasik said that at the time it was estimated that Qatar had only three days worth of food supply in case of an emergencyThe pressure is certainly on Qatar to capitulate on Saudi Arabia and its allies commands tochange its behaviorKarasik saidApart from the long lines and empty shelves at supermarkets there were other ways that the moves against Qatar could hurt it economically Notably much of the materials needed for its infrastructure and construction projects also are imported meaning that high-profile events such as the 2022 FIFA World Cup could run into major difficultiesQatars shipping industry and ports as well as itsflagship air carrier could face significant problems Its banking system could come under major strain if foreign deposits are withdrawnIf it is unwilling to meet the demands ofSaudi Arabia and its allies Qatar may have to look to alternatives According

her childrens schools to get their academic recordsShes taking them  and any valuables she can carry  when she and her family fly to Cairo to see relatives in a few days Thats because they may not returnAll the Egyptians here are feeling unstable said the doctor who declined to give her family name because she feared repercussions We dont know what will happen Maybe Qatar will ask us to leave or Egypt might ask us to come backIts been a week since several Arab countries  led by Saudi Arabia Bahrain the United Arab Emirates and Egypt  severed ties and imposed an economic blockade on Qatar after they accused it of supporting terrorism The mood in this waterside Persian Gulf capital is a mix of fear uncertainty and resilience as residents struggle to cope with a political and diplomatic crisis few imagined would so dramatically upend their worldOn Friday Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged the Saudi-led bloc to immediately ease the blockade saying it has led to unintended consequences including food shortages separated families and children being pulled out of school He added that the blockade was also harming American and international businesses while hindering US military actions in the region and the campaign against the Islamic State  Less than an hour later President Trump appeared to undermine Tillersons plea by telling reporters in Washington that Qatar has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level an accusation Qatars government has strongly deniedMembers of the Saudi-led bloc welcomed Trumps demand that Qatar end its funding and its extremist ideology but they have kept silent on Tillersons call to ease the economic pressure on the Gulf state The UAE government in a statement Friday praised Trumps leadership in challenging Qatars troubling support for extremismSaudi Arabias official news agency reported Saturday on Tillersons briefing but made no mention of his description of the blockade as harmful to ordinary residents in Qatar or US business and the fight against the Islamic StateThe Saudi-led bloc has severed links to Qatar  a nation heavily dependent on imports of food and other necessities  by land sea and air Member states have also given Qatari nationals living abroad two weeks to leave their countries as well as for any of their own citizens to return from QatarHuman rights watchdog Amnesty International in a statement Friday said Saudi Arabia Bahrain and the UAE are toying with the lives of thousands Gulf residents as part of their dispute with QatarThese drastic measures are already having a brutal effect splitting children from parents and husbands from wives said James Lynch deputy director of the groups global issues program People from across the region  not only from Qatar but also from the states implementing these measures  risk losing jobs and having their education disruptedWe are worried about losing access to our relatives in other GCC countries said Walaa El-Kadi

from Lebanon is worried too Hes a manager in a construction company which this week has already faced delays in several projects The firm used to bring raw materials and other goods over the border from Saudi Arabia and the UAE Now with the border with Saudi Arabia closed and shipping lanes shut the company is forced to turn to Germany India and other nations for raw materialsWere facing delays of at least two to three weeks said Mustafa who also feared giving his family name  Both Bahrain and the UAE have publicly declared it a crime punishable by multiyear prison sentences to show sympathy for Qatar or to criticize their governments policies toward Qatar on social media or any other means of communicationAt several supermarkets there were some shortages of foods imported from Saudi Arabia such as milk and yogurt But the panic-driven long lines and hoarding seen earlier in the week was gone There were now milk and juice from Turkey a key ally of Qatar on the shelves mitigating the lack of products from Saudi Arabia and the UAEStill there remain some concerns about the future availability of some foodsJust now when I was buying 12kilograms of onions they asked me if I really needed that much onions said Haithem Elgamal 19 referring to the workers in the Al Meera supermarketAt Dohas Hamad International Airport taxi drivers were fuming Dozens of flights mostly those of the national carrier Qatar Airways had been suspended or rerouted That meant fewer passengers arriving and fewer fares for the drivers Its really bad lamented oneWhile some residents fear that war could erupt between Qatar and its neighbors many Qataris were resilient even defiant Some patriotically placed Qatars flag in front of their houses and there was a sense the diplomatic dispute could create long-term animositiesI will never buy Saudi Arabian and UAE products again said a Qatari man leaving the Al Meera supermarket I will stay loyal to the people who support us nowElgamal was born in Qatar but holds Egyptian citizenship He said Qatar should remain independent and not kowtow to the demands of the Saudi-led bloc I will not leave Qatar even if Egypt calls us back he said This is my

postponed their trips fearing they may not be able to return Thats why shes carrying her most treasured possessionsI could postpone the trip but I am too scared to stay she said Jia Naqvi in Doha also contributed to this reportPresident Trump drew a new and forceful round of criticism Thursday from a leading Republican senator who asserted that Trump has not demonstrated the stability or competence necessary to effectively lead the countrySen Bob Corker (R-Tenn) who has been one of the most outspoken GOP Trump critics in Congress expressed displeasure with Trumps response to the deadly weekend violence in Charlottesville and warned that if the president does not change his behavior our nation is going to go through great perilThe president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful the senator told reporters in Tennessee And we need for him to be successfulCorkers remarks came on a day when at least two other Republican senators  Tim Scott (SC) and Dan Sullivan (Alaska)  also faulted the president Scott the only African American Republican in the Senate that Trumps moral authority is compromisedCorker chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee took some pauses as he spoke appearing to choose his words carefully Video of the question-and-answer session  by a staff writer for NoogacomCorker said Trump also recently has not demonstrated that he understands the character of this nation He has not demonstrated that he understands what has made this nation great and what it is todayWhile many Republicans have spoken out against Trump this week few have been willing to be as direct and extensive in their comments as Corker In recent months the senator has often been willing to venture further than many of his colleagues For example  that the White House was in a downward spiral after the revelation that Trump had revealed highly classified information to Russias foreign minister and ambassadorStill Corker did not advocate specific steps Congress ought to collectively take to punish the president or compel him to change Asked for his reaction to  Corker did not endorse the moveTrump has drawn criticism from Republicans and Democrats for blaming both sides for what happened in Charlottesville where that also drew counterprotesters A woman waskilled in the unrestI dont think that the president has appropriately spoken to the nation on this issue said Corker speaking of the language Trump has used about white supremacistsAlso on Thursday Sullivan tweeted Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable PeriodIn his interview with Vice News Scott said What we want to see from our president is clarity and moral authority And that moral authority is compromised when Tuesday happens Theres no question about that Tuesday was when Trump said I think theres blame on both sidesTrump took to Twitter earlier Thursday to criticize two Republicans Sens Jeff Flake (Ariz) and Lindsey O Graham (SC) who have spoken out against him He called Flake WEAK on borders crime and a non-factor in Senate He also praised Flakes primary challengerSaid Corker Senator Flake is one of the finest human beings Ive ever met The White House would be well served to embrace the character the substance of someone like SenatorFlakeRepublican and Democratic lawmakers urged President Trump on Tuesday not to break a trade deal with South Korea saying the agreement was vital to key industries in Americas heartlandwhich business leaders say has boosted the very workers who voted Trump into the White HouseSouth Korea is a significant economic partner our seventh largest export market and a vital customer for US manufacturers services providers farmers and ranchers the lawmakers wroteDoubts about the future of the dealfirst surfaced Saturday after The Washington Post reported Trump officials were considering a withdrawal A day later North Korea announced it had tested a hydrogen bomb that could be mounted on an intercontinental missileHis Administration holds 18th-century views of trade as a zero-sum game Sasse said in a tweeted statement I side with our farmers and ranchers who are feeding the world nowAs of Tuesday Trump had yet to reach a decision on what to do about the trade agreement with South Korea a senior White House official saidNegotiations for the free trade deal began under President George W Bush and Congress approved the agreement in 2012 KORUS has since produced mixed results the US trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled since the deal took effect but certain industries have flourishedMajor industries that would feel an immediate sting if Trump chose to back out of the deal includebeef and dairy two of the Midwests largest employers which have seen exports surge to South Korea since KORUSknocked down trade barriers There are roughly 913000 cattle operations in the United StatesDairy employs about Under KORUS which lowered tariffs on US meat beef producers have recorded an 82 percent increase in annual sales to South Korea jumping to $106 billion last year fromfrom $582 million in 2012The last five years we have been reaping the benefits Bacus said For the president to threaten to walk away from this  its very dangerous for our business Its dangerous for farmers and ranchers who rely on the value they get through exports to be able to pay their billsOne such rancher is Dawn Caldwell co-owner of Caldwell Cattle in Edgar Neb She and her husband Matt tend to about 150 cows on roughly 900 acres of land  a small operation by beef industry standardsShe fears withdrawing from KORUS could put her out of businessWed be less able to absorb the impact she said And it could get to the point where I have to sell my great-grandmothers land to one of the bigger operations That would completely break my heartThe dairy industry too stands to take a blow if Trump decides to scrap KORUSSouth Koreans bought $170 million worth of American-made cheese in 2016 said Michael Dykes president of the International Dairy Foods Association The country is the fourth largest market for US dairy exportsAbandoning the deal Dykes said would put dairy farmersat risk of facing steep tariffs which added 36 percent to the price of cheese sold in KoreaWell go back to about 36 percent while all of our competitors in other countries will continue to go duty free he saidYou have less exports less sales and potentially a need for fewer workers he saidOne sector of the economy that is less threatened by the potential end of KORUSis the steel industry whose representatives have accused China of dumping cheap government-subsidized steel into the country by way of South KoreaTwo cases on the matter sit before the International Trade Commission said a lawyer who represents the US steel industry and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of pending litigation The industry would like to see Trump stamp out the problem which representatives say pushes American steelworkers out of jobsHillary Clintons claim at a fundraiser that half of Donald Trumps supporters fit into a basket of deplorables prompted a swift and negative reaction Saturday from Republicans including denunciations and calls for her to apologizeThe comments echoed an accusation that Clinton had levied previously  that Trump appeals to and amplifies racist xenophobic and anti-Semitic viewpoints But Clinton triggered a fresh controversy by claiming that half of Trumps supporters fit that descriptionAt a key moment in the campaign when both candidates are trying to sharpen their focus for the final post-Labor Day sprint Clintons remarks took attention from Trumps spate of gaffes last week and also from her own effort to turn the publics attention to her qualifications for office and vision for the nationYou know to just be grossly generalistic you could put half of Trumps supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables Right Clinton said to applause and laughter from supporters at the LGBT for Hillary fundraiser Friday night in New York that also featured a performance by Barbra Streisand The racist sexist homophobic xenophobic Islamophobic  you name itShe continued He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11000 people  now have 11 million He tweets and retweets their offensive hateful mean-spirited rhetoricNow some of those folks  they are irredeemable but thankfully they are not AmericaCondemnation came swiftly from Trumps allies and from the candidate himself who on  and predicted that Clinton would pay a price in the polls In a statement issued later Saturday Trump said that Clintons true feelings had come out How can she be President of our country when she has such contempt and disdain for so many great Americans Trump said Hillary Clinton should be ashamed of herselfTrumps campaign manager Kellyanne Conway  something that Trump himself has Indiana Gov Mike Pence Trumps running mate also weighed in comparing Clintons remarks to President Obamas controversial 2008 comments about people who cling to guns or religion Pence said that such statements should preclude her from being elected presidentOthers compared the remark to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romneys infamous 47percent comment Even if the comparison was imprecise  at most Clintons comments referred to about one-quarter of the electorate  the Trump campaign has already sought to use the comparison to further define Clinton in the remaining months of the campaignPointing out the similarities Trump retweeted a September 2012 post from the Obama campaigns Twitter account in response to Romneys comment RT if you agree We need a President who is fighting for all Americans not one who writes off nearly half the countryIn 2012 counseling the then-Republican nominee not to apologize for them  In his remarks recorded at a private fundraiser Romney asserted that 47percent of voters will vote for the president no matter what because they are dependent upon government believe that they are victims and pay no income tax The Republican was widely criticized for giving the impression that he was writing off half the country because of their economic statusClinton issued a statement Saturday afternoon saying that she regretted using the word half to describe the Trump supporters she was referring toThat was wrong Clinton said But lets be clear whats really deplorable is that Donald Trump hired a major advocate for the so-called alt-right movement to run his campaign and that David Duke and other white supremacists see him as a champion of their valuesIn the statement Clinton blasted Trump specifically for his feud with the family of a Muslim American Army officer who died in Iraq his attacks against a Hispanic federal judge hearing two cases against him and his prominent role in the birther movement promoting the idea that Obama was not born in the United StatesIn her remarks at the fundraiser Clinton also called for empathy for the other half of Trumps supportersThat other basket of people are people who feel that the government has let them down the economy has let them down nobody cares about them nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures and theyre just desperate for change Clinton said on Friday night It doesnt really even matter where it comes fromThose are people we have to understand and empathize with as well she added     Clintons running mate Sen Tim Kaine (Va) said Saturday in an interview with The Washington Post that Clinton had nothing to apologize forShe was generalizing and saying there are some of his supporters well never get because theyre motivated by some dark motives but there are other supporters that have legitimate concerns and questions about the economy and weve got to speak to them in the campaign he said And even to the extent that they vote against us we still have to respond to their concerns if we have the opportunity to governIn an election cycle that has been more characterized by Trumps controversies Clintons comments represent a reversal of fortune and a rare moment when she stepped on a news cycle that had not been favorable to Trump The flap also comes as polls show Trump narrowing Clintons lead nationally and in battleground statesEver since he installed new campaign leadership about three weeks ago Trump has softened his tone on the campaign trail and mostly stuck to prepared rally speeches loaded onto teleprompters That level of discipline seemed to fade Friday night during a rally in a packed arena in the Florida PanhandleTrump said that as president he would shoot Iranian boats out of the water if they make improper gestures toward American vessels that Clinton is so protected from having to face consequences that she could murder someone in front of 20000 witnesses and not face prosecution and that voters need to be very very vigilant on Election DayHours before Clintons remarks at the fundraiser for appearing on a state-owned Russian television network to praise Russian President Vladimir Putin and disparage US foreign policy Clinton had seized on those comments at a news conference earlier in the dayIm not sure anything surprises us anymore Clinton said But I was certainly disappointed that someone running for president of the United States would continue this unseemly identification with and praise of the Russian president including on Russian television  After news broke of Clintons deplorables comment Trumps allies seized on the moment to paint Clinton as dismissive of a large portion of votersIt wasnt the first time Clinton had used that languageIn  she said something similar  but without quantifying the amount of Trumps support that qualified for the label deplorableClinton also delivered a major speech weeks ago devoted to Trumps association with the alt-right the name used by a movement of white nationalist ideologyShe accused Trump of irresponsibly highlighting that movement by amplifying its messages on Twitter The speech was aimed at moderate Republicans and independent voters whom the campaign is encouraging to break from Trump in part because of the alt-right figures who support himClinton reprised that part of her case against Trump at the fundraising event Friday night But the furor over deplorables put her aides and supporters on the defensive and they attempted to refocus attention on the parts of Clintons remarks that called for mutual understandingOthers pointed out recent polling of Trumps own supporters think he is racist According to a  conducted over the summer 77percent of Trump supporters say they are bothered when they come in contact with immigrants who speak little or no English compared with half of Americans overall And 83percent of Trump supporters say that Islam is contradictory to American values compared with 57percent of Americans overallSome Clinton allies acknowledged the perils of painting voters with too broad a brush but they insisted that Clinton was right to denounce hatredI think its a bad idea for any candidate to make generalizations about voters like an amateur pollster or sociologist would former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau wrote on Twitter But Trump does it every single day and its always worseWhy werent there comparisons to 47% when Trump said that all black lives were a disaster Or when he said that all Muslims are helping terrorists hide among us he tweetedTrumps aides  who see their candidate as an outsider fighting against Washington elites  see an opportunity to suggest not only that Clinton doesnt understand struggling Americans but that she also has disdain for them The Republican National Committee held a conference call Saturday afternoon with campaign aides and surrogates tearing into Clintons remarks and saying that Trump in contrast would be a president for all people Mr Trump is running to be president for all Americans black white Latino men women everybody Trump spokesman Jason Miller said on the call which also included Rep Marsha Blackburn and Pastor Darrell Scott    Jenna Johnson and John Wagner in Richmond contributed to this reportHillary Clinton said Friday night in New York that half of Donald Trumps supporters areracist sexist xenophobic homophobic and/or IslamophobicAt an LGBT for Hillary fundraiser where Barbra Streisand performed Clinton expanded on previous comments about many Trump supporters falling into a  that includes the groupslisted aboveThe difference this time was that she put a number on it And it wasnt a small numberYou know to just be grossly generalistic youcould put half of Trumps supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables Right Clinton said  The racist sexist homophobicxenophobic Islamaphobic  you name itRepublicans instantly cried foul Trump tweeted about it Saturday morning And many are likening it to Mitt Romneys much-talked-about 47 percent comment from the 2012 campaign  a comment to which some attributed Romneys lossWow Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters millions of amazing hard working people I think it will cost her at the Polls Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump)   But how similar are theyOn the one hand both are very broad extremely negative generalizations about large segments of the American public Romney suggested that nearly half of Americans were so reliant on government that they would vote for President Obama no matter whatRomney in comments unearthed from a closed-door fundraiser cited 47 percent ofpeople who believe that they are victims who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them who believe that they are entitled to health care to food to housing to you-name-it He added Ill never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their livesFact-checkers said Romney    or at the very least that he vastly oversimplified itClinton in making her basket of deplorables comment seemed to acknowledge that she was about to oversimplifythingsBut she still was generalizing a large segment of the American peopleGiven about 40 percent of Americans support Trump in the polls Clinton appeared to be slappingthe racist sexist homophobicxenophobic Islamaphobic label on about 20 percent of the country Thats no small thing  even if she acknowledged she was being grossly generalisticClintons campaign though seemed to suggest that Clinton only meant people who attend Trumps rallies and activelysupport him  not all Trump voters(2/3) Obviously not everyone supporting Trump is part of the alt right but alt right leaders are with Trump Nick Merrill (@NickMerrill) (3/3) And their supporters appear to make up half his crowd when you observe the tone of his events Nick Merrill (@NickMerrill) One key difference between the two is that Romneys comment might have alienated potential supporters As  many people who dont pay federal income tax are retirees who tend to tilt Republican And many GOP voters either dont pay federal income tax because they dont make enough money and/or are also at least partially reliant on government programsRomneysaid he was talking about Obama supporters but many real and potential Romney supporters might have heard his comments and seen themselves in themClintons comments in contrast are clearly about people who were already voting for her opponent as  Her comments might serve to rile them up and make them more passionate about voting and helping Trump but they werent going to vote for Clinton anywayAnother key difference is that Clintons comments fit into a narrative she has already been pushing She had called Trump supporters racists and sexists and homophobes before she just hadnt put a number on itRemember this isnt a new formulation Same argument all the way down to grossly generalistic Core talking pt  Liam Donovan (@LPDonovan) Romneys comments meanwhile were made at a closed-door fundraiser at which he thought he was just speaking to his supporters His comments there didnt feed into a broader point he was pushing about Obama supporters being moochers addicted to government largesseClinton has lit a fire here by attaching a specific figure to her claims  just as Romney did There will certainly be plenty of chatter about this in the hours and days aheadIts not clear that she intended to use that numberand actually suggest that 20 percent of the country is prejudiced against minorities gays and Muslims Thats a very controversial thing to say to put it lightly But its at least along the lines of a narrative shes been pushingWell see if she just pushed it too farI wont stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign Hillary  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton)Republicans agree that Mitt Romney is struggling to break free of a series of  How he should respond is another matter   the Republican presidential nominee tells a private audience of campaign donors that supporters of President Obama will vote for the president no matter what Romney adds that he does not worry about those peopleThere are 47 percent who are with him Romney said of Obama who are dependent upon government who believe that they are victims who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them who believe that they are entitled to health care to food to housing to you name it These are people who pay no income taxIn response New York Times conservative columnist David Brooks compared Romney to Thurston Howell III the wealthy character from the television show Gilligans Island who embodied for many television viewers the behavior of elitist New Englanders  that Romneys comments suggest he doesnt know much about the culture of America and later that he doesnt know much about the political cultureThe Republican Party and apparently Mitt Romney too has shifted over toward a much more hyperindividualistic and atomistic social view  from the Reaganesque language of common citizenship to the libertarian language of makers and takers Brooks added Theres no way the country will trust the Republican Party to reform the welfare state if that party doesnt have a basic commitment to provide a safety net for those who suffer for no fault of their ownBrooks called Romney a kind decent man who says stupid things because he is pretending to be something he is not  some sort of cartoonish government-hater But it scarcely matters Hes running a depressingly inept presidential campaign Mr Romney your entitlement reform ideas are essential but when will the incompetence stopBrooks was not alone in condemning Romneys remarks William Kristol editor of the conservative Weekly Standard said it remains critical that Romney win the election But that shouldnt blind us to the fact that Romneys comments like those of Obama four years ago Kristol was referring to comments Obama made in April 2008 when he said that certain voters get bitter and cling to guns or religion or antipathy to explain their frustrations   said he agreed that the former governor inartfully articulated his argument but added that the Republican presidential candidate was broaching a subject worthy of further discussion When I campaign I campaign on four pillars fiscal discipline limited government accountability and a strong national defense and I talk about the need for the government to provide a safety net Chaffetz said But we should be encouraging training and other types of things to get people back on their feet so they dont have to have this government dependency Thats totally consistent with what Governor Romney has been advocating and campaigning onBut more moderate Republicans facing tougher elections sought to distance themselves from Romneys comments Linda McMahon who has seen her chances improve in the Connecticut US Senate race said she disagreed with Romneys insinuation that 47% of Americans believe they are victims who must depend on the government for their careIn a statement posted on her Web site early Tuesday McMahon said that I know that the vast majority of those who rely on government are not in that situation because they want to be People today are struggling because the government has failed to keep America competitiveChris Murphy McMahons Democratic opponent said her comments were the latest desperate attempt to distance herself from the right-wing agenda and Republican party she strongly supportsJoe Scarborough a former Republican congressman from Florida whose MSNBC program Morning Joe is a favorite of Beltway insiders spent most of his program Tuesday pillorying Romneys misstep Those words would never cross the lips of Jeb Bush Chris Christie Paul Ryan Scarborough  They would never say that in a million years This guy is seeming  he just seems too insulated by wealth and by life experienceLater on  Scarborough said Romney was reeling from one of the worst weeks for any presidential candidate in a general election that any of us can rememberThis is dangerous  not because hes going to lose that 47 percent of the vote  but because youre going to start seeing suburban voters swing voters storm away from the campaign as quickly as possible unless he fixes it Scarborough addedAppearing on the same NBC program businessman and Romney supporter Donald Trump said Romney shouldnt apologize for his comment Weve seen enough apologizing already Trump said He cannot apologize What he said is probably what he means and he did say [it was] inartfully stated The fact is he cannot apologize he is going for those independents but he wont get the votes of a lot of people hes discussing and if youre not going to get their votes lets go on with it but do not apologizeTrump also lamented that Republicans generally are not being tough enough Theyre not  I cant say down and dirty  but thats exactly what President Obama is doing with them They have to fight fire with fire the Republicans have to get tougher or theyre going to lose this campaignBut Rick Davis who advised Sen John McCains failed 2008 presidential bid attempted to put the Romney comments in context and urged the GOP candidate to use the moment to recast his campaignNoting that everybody has their YouTube moment in American politics  that Romneys response to the videos in the coming days is criticalThis is a character-building moment Davis said The American public looks in at various times during a campaign and I promise you theyll be looking in this week And it may be a fresh candidate for Mitt Romney the candidate to try to connect with votersBut conservative radio talk show host and commentator Laura Ingraham said Romney was merely expressing a viewpoint shared by many political pundits  that the nation is closely divided and that Romney and Obama are fighting to convince just a small slice of the electorateThe percentage might be off by 1 or 2 percentage points depending on how you formulate it  The bottom line is Mitt Romney speaking at a fundraiser about the challenges a Republican faces in this presidential race  not all that unlike what political pundits many of them hyperventilating today have said That there is a small slice of the electorate that is undecided Thats basically what he said thereThe idea that youre declaring Well the race is over Mitt Romney doesnt care about people Meanwhile you have a president whose policies have undermined the 47 percentIngraham added that the political press should focus more on Obamas plans to spend most of Tuesday raising money from celebrities  including musicians Jay-Z and Beyonce  after appearing tonight on CBSs The Late Show with David LettermanShe did not mention that  is slated to air on the popular daytime television program Live with Kelly and MichaelAs a growing number of women accuse Harvey Weinstein of predatory behavior actressRose McGowan has used her Twitter account to rally support forthe women like her who are now naming themselves as his victimsOn the flip side of that supportwas her Twitterwrath toward Ben Affleck who  Weinstein this weekYou lie she said in one tweet tagging the actors Twitter handle McGowan has spent considerable time over the past few days calling out Affleck and other powerful individuals whom she believed had prior knowledge of Weinsteins behaviorOvernight on Thursdayone of those tweets got McGowan temporarily suspended for the platform The actress posted an image of a message she received from Twitter to her Instagram account A post shared by Rose McGowan (@rosemcgowan) on Twitter whichhas a history of declining to comment on specific suspensions initially declined to comment in this case for privacy and security reasons McGowans Instagram post also does not include the specific tweet that Twitter determined was in violation of the rules but the offending tweet has been deleted and her account is unlockedThe Washington Postfound one recent deleted tweet from McGowans timeline from October 11th Anonymously sent to me They all knew It starts here the tweet read Attached was an image of a portion of an email that offered to set up a meeting with Bob presumably Bob Weinstein from context at a hotel in the early evening The now-deleted image contained the full email signature of the person sending it including their phone number which could be a violation of  releasing private information without permissionLater in a tweeted statement Twitterexplained that her account was temporarily locked because one of her Tweets included a private phone number which violates our Terms of Service and that We will be clearer about these policies and decisions in the futureTwitter is proud to empower and support the voices on our platform especially those that speak truth to power We stand with the brave women and men who use Twitter to share their stories and will work hard every day to improve our processes to protect those voices 3/3 Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) Some of McGowans more confrontational tweets were about Affleck TheresBen Affleck foff tagging Afflecks Twitter handle that directly accuses him of lying GODDAMNIT I TOLD HIM TO STOP DOING THAT you said that to my face The press conf I was made to go to after assault she wroteOther tweetssome using the hashtag #RoseArmy have accused other associates and backersof Weinsteins projects over the years of being guilty as wellYOU ALL KNEW  rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) All of those tweets are still live however meaning they arent the specific tweets that triggered the suspensionThe specific type oflimitation on McGowans account indicates that it might have beentriggered either by the platforms algorithms or by the result of a user report Twitter introduced the 12-hour account limitation earlier this year This particular punishment does not rely entirely on user reports of possible rule-breaking but instead can also be triggered automatically If an account is tagging others in potentially abusive tweets or firing off a great deal of similar tweets flagged by the system as potentially abusive those can be factors that prompt a suspension the company said at the time  But like many of Twitters anti-abuse practices theres a lot of murkiness here tothe enforcement Even as the platform takes more aggressive steps to fight harassment and abuse the actual enforcement of the rules designed to protect its users remains inconsistentof a tweet into account when deciding whether to take action against it or not For instance Twitters  that contain threats of violence or those that promote violence but the platform has allowed this tweet from President Donald Trump to remain on the platformJust heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at UN If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man they wont be around much longer Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) The potential anti-violence rule violation  as well as the newsworthiness  of this tweet are both clear And there is an extremely strong case to be made for the newsworthiness of McGowan and her tweets in the Weinstein story a story in which she is directly involved as a victim But Twitter seems to have come to a different conclusion about McGowans tweetAccording to the  McGowan reached a $100000 settlement with Weinstein in 1997 for an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival Although she initially declined to comment to The Times she has since in real timebecame one of the loudest advocates for his victimsThe Saints issued a  Thursday in response to a Louisiana military veterans refusal to accept an award at the

been tabbed to receive aPeoples Health Champion award which honors (per the companys ) the exceptional achievements of Louisiana residents age 65 and older He was to receive the award at the Saints home game Sunday against the Buccaneers but he turned down the opportunity telling the team in a letterAlthough I am touched and honored to be selected for such an award the ongoing controversy with NFL players disrespect for the national flag forces me to decline to participate in the presentationSince this award is tainted with the dishonorable actions of the NFL and its players I cannot accept it he continued To do so would be hypocriticalIn its response the Saints noted that their players have chosen to stand for our National Anthem out of respect for the flag our servicemen and women and veterans in every game since our inception in 1967 with the exception of one game the Week Three game at Carolina when a few of our players did sit That week saw an unprecedented amount of NFL players stage protests largely in reaction to sharp criticism by President Trump including his use of the phrase son of a bitch at a rally in AlabamaSince then New Orleans players have knelt together before the anthem then stood during pregame renditions of it to the dismay of some fans When the Saints took a knee before a game earlier this month some fans in the Superdome booed them even as  for a slain New Orleans police officer was being observed  Our crowd boos us before the anthem therefore its not about the flag its about the fact we are bringing awareness to a cause that makes people uncomfortable New Orleans safety Kenny Vaccarro  Thursday on Twitter He  They are booing because we want change Its pretty sadAfter Vaccarro and teammate Alex Okafor were among the players who sat during the anthem in Week 3 their invitations to serve as grand marshals for a Mardi Gras parade were Saying I am disappointed in the NFL Louisiana Lt Gov Billy Nungesser  that he would not attend the teams Week 4 game against the Dolphins in London although he was in that city at the timeAt league meetings earlier this month NFL owners  to the leagues policy on anthem conduct which only requires players to be present on the sideline and does not mandate that they standI think most of us believe that attempting to force the players to do something that they dont want to do is not going to be effective in the long run New York Giants co-owner John Mara saidNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell did say after those meetingsWe believe everyone should stand for the national anthem He added that the league would continue to encourage players to standI had hoped and prayed that the NFL would outlaw these disgraceful protests and wanted to give the commissioner and the owners a fair opportunity to do so Wells said in his letter Their failure to act is a slap in the face to all of those who have served in uniform Men and women have fought and died for the flag that the players are disrespecting  If we are to be challenged about our dedication to the military we then contend we are leaders when it comes to financial support as well as the thousands of service hours our organization and players gladly contribute to the military the Saints said in theirresponse The team listed a number of military-oriented organizations that have benefited from its contributions and it noted that owner Tom Benson served on the USS South Dakota in World War II and was awarded the prestigious Lone Sailor Award among other recognitions for his support of our militaryOur respect and support of our servicemen and women and veterans is unquestionable the Saints said During this weekends game we will again proudly recognize our servicemen and women and veterans and we do so with the full cooperation appreciation and attendance of our military heroesPHILADELPHIA  Sen Bernie Sanders spoke to every one of his nearly 1900 delegates Monday afternoon beseeching them to join him in a united Democratic front for the November election In an address that had been closed to press but was partially opened (and widely live-streamed by attendees) Sanders went through every item of his platform then made an awkward pivotImmediately right now we have got to defeat Donald Trump said Sanders to cheersAnd weve got to elect Hillary Clinton Sanders addedThe boos in the Philadelphia Convention Center were overwhelming and sustained for 30 seconds as Sanders stood tight-lipped on stage There were chants of We Want Bernie and Green Party and take it to the floor  an apparent call for Sanders delegates to be allowed to cast their votes and not be released to vote for Clinton  Sanders who endorsed Clinton two weeks ago seemed taken aback by the level of anger This is the world we live in he explained His wife Jane OMeara Sanders could be heard speculating that the booing delegates did not realize that there would be a roll call voteTrump is a bully and a demagogue said Sanders re-opening the playbook he used in the final weeks of the Democratic primary He does not respect African Americans and LatinosSo has she So has she yelled one heckler referring to Clinton There was another eruption of booing culminating in a louder round of We Want Bernie chantsI will do everything I can to see that he is defeated said Sanders ending the Clinton part of the speechBefore the booing began the Sanders delegate meeting was busy raucous and joyful Having given up his Secret Service protection with the end of his campaign Sanders was guarded only by some convention security allowing delegates to crowd around the stage where hed speak And he did not release his delegates  setting up for the first time since 1992 a roll call vote where opponents of the presumptive nominee will get their votes counted en masseThat encouraged some of the diehard Sanders voters who desperately wanted to avoid a vote for Clinton Earlier today members of the Bernie Delegates Network -- a new progressive coalition of around 1250 of Sanderss 1900 delegates -- told reporters that delegates who lived in deep red or deep blue states were free to vote for third party candidates The cries of Green Party in the convention rooms were references to Jill Stein that partys likely nominee who has make several public appearances per day in Philadelphia to ask for Sanders supporters to cross overSome Sanders delegates were terrified of that mood gripping their peers I dont want a third party not after what happened in my state in 2000 said Samantha Herring 46 a Sanders delegate from Floridas panhandle who toted a sign withthe popular slogan Love Trumps Hate Im a Democrat first and a lot of things that have transpired here have been very undemocratic But I assure you if Bernie says get to work Ill get to workThat work she said would start after the convention Until Thursday at least she was voting for Bernie Sanders At the mid-day rally even some Sanders surrogates who had endorsed Clinton like former NAACP president Benjamin Jealous avoided mentions of her name -- and thereby avoided hecklersDUBAI United Arab Emirates  Among those detained in Saudi Arabia no name carries more power in Western financial markets than Prince Alwaleed bin TalalThe prince listed by Forbes as the richest Arab with $187 billion to his name long has made big bets in the markets holding major stakes in companies like Apple and CitiBankBut his arrest now comes after Saudi Arabia hosted a major investment summit in Riyadh at one of the hotels now reportedly holding dozens of princes and former officials detained late Saturday in what authorities described as an anti-corruption campaign This is going to cause some immediate apprehension in terms of investors looking at Saudi Arabia said Graham Griffiths a senior analyst at Control Risks focusing on Saudi Arabia Prince Alwaleed is someone who has been represented as a face of the kingdom someone that a lot of people have done business with and are comfortable doing business withPrince Alwaleed 62 is a major shareholder in Twitter as well as an investor in ride-sharing services Lyft and Careem He is also majority owner of the popular Rotana Group of Arabic satellite channels and owns shares in the Four Seasons and Movenpick hotel chainsIts unclear how his arrest will affect global financial markets but it is already having an effect in the ultraconservative kingdom Shares in his Kingdom Holding Co fell 75 percent in trading Sunday to 950 riyals ($253) a share despite it announcing profits of 2475 million riyals ($66 million) in the third quarterThe prince has not been afraid to make big bets and lose billions including backing then-CitiBank CEO Vikram Pandit amid the 2008 financial crisis He earlier rescued the bank when it was CitiCorp in 1991 I dont make mistakes I make blunders the prince told Vanity Fair in 2013 When you make a mistake you lose $10 million $50 million $100 million but when you make a mistake of $200 million to $500 million or $1 billion thats a blunderBut while Saudi Arabias King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman have eagerly embraced US President Donald Trump Prince Alwaleed famously criticized him during his campaign You are a disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America the businessman tweeted in December 2015 amid the uproar over Trumps comments about banning Muslims from traveling to the United States Withdraw from the US presidential race as you will never winTrump who once sold a yacht to the prince in 1991 and part of New Yorks Plaza Hotel to him in 1995 responded by calling him dopey and saying he wanted to control our US politicians with daddys money Cant do it when I get electedPrince Alwaleed later congratulated Trump on his

royal family members cabinet ministers and former government officials in an extraordinary purge on Saturday that included the arrest of Prince Alwaleed bin Talal  who owns major stakes in such companies as Twitter and CitigroupSaudi officials and media outlets framed the detentions as stemming from an urgent new drive to root out graft in the kingdom But it also appeared part of an effort by the countrys ambitious and brash crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to consolidate power by eliminating rivals or critics in the event that his father King Salman soon abdicates the throneNews of the arrests was announced by the state news agency and the Saudi-owned al-Arabiya news channel  that 11 princes four ministers as well as tens of former ministers had been arrested on the orders of Mohammed who was appointed by his father Saturday as the head of a new anti-corruption committeeThe announcements carried few names but Alwaleed was among those detained according to an associate of his family The reasons for his arrest were not immediately clear The prince who is the founder of the business conglomerate Kingdom Holding and one of the worlds most prominent investors had been supportive at least publicly of the Saudi leadershipThe detentions came at a time of unprecedented political social and economic upheaval in Saudi Arabia an absolute monarchy that has President Trump

Saudi Arabia commonly imprisons independent political voices the recent arrests were unusual in several waysThe Saudi regime is in the midst of profound political change Understanding its latest decisions requires a nuanced look at its fragmented politics and the regimes liberalizing agendaWhile some media outlets reported these arrests as those detained in fact represent a broad range of ideological affiliations The Islamists include both ultraconservatives and progressives with widely different views Conservatives such as Muhammad al-Habdan have relentlessly campaigned for more social conservatism and reject democracy Meanwhile progressives such as Salman al-Awda vocally  called for the  and even The list of detainees also includes several young reformist intellectuals

at home in front of their families According to my interviews several dozen more sheikhs intellectuals and activists were interrogated and threatened These arrests were reportedly carried out not by the Ministry of the Interior but by a  the presidency of state security under the direct authority of the royal courtWhat explains these changes in policy An official statement Sept 12  as part of a security campaign against intelligence cells for the benefit of foreign parties This means Qatar Most of the detainees had indeed avoided a stance in the current crisis After without much progress the Saudi authorities may have decided to create a diversion by scapegoating supposed domestic Qatari agentsHowever these arrests have deeper causes that need to be properly analyzedUntil the early 1990s the Saudi regime maintained close relations with a range of Islamist groups Starting in the 1960s the kingdom  persecuted by Arab nationalist regimes In the 1980s more radical Islamists fighting in Afghanistan enjoyed the kingdoms protectionThose foreign activists influenced Saudi society leading to the development of a powerful indigenous Islamist movement the Sahwa or awakening In 1990 after Saddam Husseins invasion of Kuwait Sahwa activists spearheaded a movement against the royal familys invitation to base US troops on its soil This dissent landed the movements main figures including al-Awda in jail and sowed the seeds of distrust between the regime and Islamists local and foreignIn 2002 the then-interior ministerPrince Nayef as the source of all evil in Saudi Arabia That distrust only continued to grow with the Arab Spring as Islamists won the first democratic elections in Tunisia and Egypt Inspired by the uprisings many Saudi Islamists circulated petitions calling for reforms in the kingdom including the  Towards of State of Rights and Institutions backed by some 9000 signatoriesBacklash against Islamists gathered steam in 2013 The Saudi regime supported the overthrow of Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsi then  and all organizations that resemble it terrorists In March 2014 Saudi Arabia and its allies launched a  largely because of Dohas support for Islamists Since then Saudi Islamists have recognized their peril But previous rounds of arrests were limited to human rights activists and lesser-known IslamistsUntil the 2015 death of King Abdullah the regime dealt with political conflicts through co-optation Under this paternalistic authoritarianism repression was generally a last recourse The Saudi state was fragmented balancing power between the royal family and the religious establishment as well as among prominent members of the royal family itself each with a fiefdom and clientele Governing Saudi Arabia was a constant game of checks and balances which allowed for some political pluralism however constrained The 2000s were marked by a  between Islamists and Liberals Decision-making remained the exclusive prerogative of the royal family but these debates were importantThat system is now being dismantled In the past two years crown prince Muhammad bin Salman has risen rapidly seizing control of most of the states powers With the support of his father King Salman the prince has successfully sidelined competing royal factions most notably former crown prince Muhammad bin Nayef who is now  MBS hassimultaneously weakened the independent authority of the religious establishment recently  to arrest moral offendersIn place of the horizontality and consensus seeking that previously characterized the Saudi system there is now a vertical line of power ending with MBS In my interviews his supporters have justified this shift by the need for efficient decision-making during times of crisis rather than the political inertia that once marked the Saudi systemCentral to that narrative is the crown princesmodernizing project for Saudi Arabia outlined in his  an ambitious plan of economic and social reforms announced in 2016 A significant part of that plan consists in liberalizing Saudi society from above For a kingdom worried about its image abroad allowing women to drive in the wake of massive arrests is of course no coincidenceDomestically the decision was justified as an economic necessity with no mention of the hundreds of female activists who campaigned for three decades for that right Doing so could have risked suggesting that the government was reacting to social pressures and encourage further dissentThough mostly popular the modernizing reforms have little to do with empowering civil society or promoting democratic governance They are better understood as a bid to make the Saudi leadership yet another modernizing autocrat in the region The new social pact offered is simple fewer political freedoms in exchange for the promise of state-driven social progress and economic results Saudi Arabia is no longer the exception it once wasRIYADH Saudi Arabia  Saudi Arabia said its forces

southern border by Yemens Houthi rebels according to several Houthi-owned media outlets including Al-Masirah and SABA The rebels are at war with the kingdomSaudi Arabia said the missile was shot down by its air defense forces with fragments of the missile landing in an uninhabited area north of the capital Saudi Arabias Civil Aviation Authority said the missile did not cause any damage to the King Khalid International Airport and that flights were not disruptedThis is the first time that a Houthi missile has come so close to a heavily populated area and it appears to be the farthest that such a missile has reached inside Saudi Arabia Riyadh is around 620 miles (1000 kilometers) north of the border with YemenA Saudi military spokesman condemned the attack in a statement saying the missile was fired indiscriminately toward a populated civilian areaSaudi military forces have intercepted missiles fired by Houthis several times since March 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition launched a war against the rebels and their allies after they captured northern Yemen and ousted the Saudi-backed president from power The kingdom has also imposed an air and sea blockade on YemenThe stalemated war has killed more than 10000 civilians and displaced 3 million others pushing the Arab worlds poorest country to the brink of famineThe US which is one of the kingdoms most important military suppliers has backed the coalition with logistical supportSaudi Arabia accuses its rival Shiite power Iran of training and helping arm the rebels Iran denies that it has provided material support though it acknowledges its political support of the HouthisNews outlet Al-Masirah said the missile launched Saturday evening was made in Yemen and was the third to be fired toward Riyadh this year It reported the rebels saying the missile was fired in response to Saudi-American aggression and crimes against the people of YemenEarlier this week a suspected airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition killed at

broadcast rewritten or redistributedStung by falling oil prices Saudi Arabia has cut spending and subsidies as part of harsh austerity measures that threaten the lavish welfare programs underpinning its stabilityThe oil-exporting giants economy has gone from producing windfalls to deficits and Saudi rulers increasingly struggle to provide the cushy government jobs expensive state handouts and tax-free living that have long bought them domestic obedienceThe pivot to austerity  which also has been imposed by neighboring Gulf Arab oil monarchies  risks triggering unrest in a Saudi society that is conservative and particularly resistant to change analysts and diplomats warnThe cutbacks are seen as necessary by King Salmans son defense minister and head of economic planning Mohammed bin Salman  for overseeing leadership shake-ups at home and two wars abroad Advisers say he also intends to wean the country off its overwhelming dependence on oil sales and reform a bloated and opaque public sector  He understands that now is the moment to capitalize on low oil prices by cutting wasteful subsidies and reforming our economy to make us stronger said Fahad Bin Jumah a Saudi economist and member of the countrys Consultative Assembly who has advised Prince MohammedOil prices have plunged by about 70 percent over the last year and a half even falling below $30 a barrel this month battering the worlds second-largest producer and jarring a society that has grown accustomed to easy money and extravagant consumerism Oil revenue accounts for an estimated 90 percent of the Saudi governments income leading to last years large budget deficit of $98 billion or about 15 percent of gross domestic productSaudi Arabia a US ally and absolute monarchy has for decades managed to ride out manic oil-price fluctuations amassing astonishing revenue that has financed a healthy cushion of backup foreign-currency reserves worth hundreds of billions of dollarsBut in October  that the government which projects a deficit of $87 billion for 2016 could run out of money within five years if it did not tighten spendingIn response Prince Mohammed pushed a raft of cost-cutting measures late last year that included a partial lifting of costly subsidies on gasoline electricity and water Authorities have reined in public spending imposed hiring freezes and halted work on infrastructure and real estate projects Officials talk about privatizing industry including the prized national oil companyThe prince even discussed imposing taxes a sensitive subject for Saudis during an  Were talking about taxes or fees that are supported by the citizen he told the magazine although he explicitly ruled out imposing income taxesFor many here austerity has not been easyShopping centers no longer fill with patrons as they used to Business owners complain of anemic sales And many Saudis even those who flaunt luxury cars and live in palatial homes seem increasingly concerned about personal financesLook Im not going shopping as much and Im not spending like I used to said Mohammed Abdullah 25 an employee at a government-run charity in the capital Riyadh Im spending more money on gas these daysBusinesses say they have had to increase prices to cope with the rising costs from subsidy cuts Weve basically stopped hiring too said Mohammed a manager of a company in Jiddah that imports European foods He asked that his full name not be used because of concerns over repercussions for his business  The oil crash has rippled beyond Saudi Arabia spurring similar  and hiring freezes among fellow members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) a regional political and economic union of six petroleum-rich Gulf Arab monarchies The  Qatar Oman and Bahrain have joined Saudi Arabia in austerity and appear close to finalizing a GCC-wide value-added tax that could come into effect in 2018Analysts say the moves signal recognition in these countries that rising international competition in energy production means the days of $100 or more for a barrel of crude oil may forever be a thing of the pastI think there is growing recognition here that we need reform said Khalid al-Dakhil a Saudi analyst based in RiyadhBut reforms could undo a bargain that for decades has preserved stability in Saudi Arabia and its smaller neighbors where inflated government salaries and benefits including free health care and education as well as handsome cash transfers have also largely pacified citizens and fostered a high-spending culture Range Rovers Gucci bags and other luxuries are consumed like mundane objects in these countriesThe Gulf Arabs are looking vulnerable and I dont know if they can weather the storm said Labib Kamhawi a Jordan-based analystIn recent years Saudi Arabias bulging young population  more than two-thirds of its 22 million citizens are younger than 30  has stretched the welfare state thin and caused unemployment to balloon Thousands of low-level princes rely on a vastly expensive royal payroll And the austere form of Sunni Islam observed in the country denies adequate job and other opportunities to women whose participation in the workforce is generally a key component of economic prosperityThe bottom line is that this is a state that is resistant to change opaque in how it functions at almost every level and looking especially vulnerable at the moment said Christopher Davidson an expert on Persian Gulf countries who teaches politics at Durham UniversityWhether the Gulf Arab oil producers  all US allies  can avoid Arab Spring-like instability may depend on what happens with Saudi Arabia analysts and diplomats say The kingdom acts as a big brother in terms of defense and political leadership for the GCC but the kingdoms attention has shifted to costly foreign entanglements overseen by Prince MohammedThe prince became second in line to the throne after his father became king last year The prince then launched a war in Yemen against Iranian-aligned insurgents and has boosted support for rebels in Syrias civil war  The moves are meant to parry the influence of Iran Saudi Arabias regional chief competitor but they have  who prefer the kingdoms traditionally cautious approach to foreign policy Saudis moreover quietly express concern over the sustainability of Prince Mohammeds expensive foreign projects during lean domestic timesI think there is a sense here of recklessness at the top levels said one prominent Saudi with links to senior leaders who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of concern over retributionStill in public Prince Mohammed earns praise hereHe knows how to keep our economy strong said Faisal bin Ahmed 36 co-owner of an events management company in Riyadh He owns four luxury vehicles including a Bentley and flashes around a snakeskin walletYet even the wealthy arent immune to the princes cost-cutting policiesFatn al-Shehir 23 said her father has started suggesting that she curtail her daily excursions in her Chevrolet Tahoe with the family driver (Because women are still forbidden from driving in the kingdom they rely on taxis and chauffeurs)She just graduated with a degree in business but has been unable to find a job She spends her days dropping off rsums at businesses and state-run institutionsNow when I go out my dad tells me Youre leaving again Its getting expensive to pay for all your bills Shehir saidIn a way hes joking But in a way hes not Sheikha Aldosary contributed to this reportWomen in Saudi Arabia will be permitted to drive in the kingdom for the first time according to a royal decree issued in Riyadh on Tuesday that overturned one of the most widely criticized restrictions on human rightsThe change may be the most visible sign yet of a modernizing Saudi Arabia with reforms implemented by the heir apparent to the Saudi throne Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Signed by his father King Salman and broadcast on state television the decree said that the majority of senior scholars had deemed the change legitimate under Islamic law and ordered the government ministries concerned to make whatever legal adjustments are required to implement it by June24For much of the rest of the world the prohibition on women driving has long symbolized the many restrictions on individual freedoms in Saudi Arabia particularly those applying to women The Saudi ambassador to the United States Prince Khaled bin Salman who spoke at a news conference in Washington hailed the development as a historic big day in our kingdom He said that female drivers would not need to travel with male guardians or seek permission to obtain drivers licenses and that womens licenses from other countries in the region would be recognizedThe change aligns Saudi Arabia with other conservative monarchies in the Persian Gulf that have long allowed women to drive It was unclear whether the lifting of requirements that male relatives accompany women or give permission for them to leave their homes still implemented in much of the country would apply to activities other than drivingThe Saudi government which has long endured negative publicity over its restrictive domestic policies was eager to broadcast the change In addition to the news conference at the embassy in Washington the Foreign Ministry contacted reporters offering to arrange calls with selected Saudi women to comment on the policyThe ambassador said the decision was not based on religion but on social and economic considerations and was part of the modernization reforms being implemented by the crown prince  There is no wrong time to do the right thing the ebullient ambassador said With more women entering the workplace they need to drive themselves to work He said the implementation delay was needed to ensure that the legal and logistical environment was prepared for the change We have to make sure our streets are ready for a potential doubling in traffic he saidProminent female Saudi activists had spent years publicly protesting the ban posting videos of themselves driving on Saudi roads or toward the countrys borders The videos garnered hundreds of thousands of views and often landed the activists in jailLoujain al-Hathloul who was detained for 73 days in 2014 after attempting to drive into Saudi Arabia from the United Arab Emirates was rearrested this year and held for several days Praise be to God Hathloul tweeted after the announcementI am just happy that I no longer have to tell my 7-year-old to stop ogling at women driving in Europe because yes its normal and okay for women to drive said Loulwa Bakr a senior financial adviser in JiddahOne small pedal for Saudi women one giant leap for womenkind Bakr said in a telephone interview from Riyadh She was one of several women independently contacted by The Washington PostAsma Siddiki an educator at King Abdullah Economic City said the issue was not the top priority for Saudi women but had become symbolicWe enjoy some rights that other celebrated democracies do not enjoy and yet everything was brushed under the all-encompassing question of the right of women to drive she said I feel ecstatic that it is about to become a moot topicI am also quite relieved she added that I not my husband may be the person who will teach my children how to drive being a better driver in my opinion Samid Hadid the deputy Middle East director for Amnesty International tweeted Huge congrats and credit to the brave women who fought for this May this be the start of more freedoms for women in Saudi ArabiaAt the State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Were happyThis news just came to us moments ago Nauert said at the departments regular afternoon briefing So I think were just happy today with the steps that they are taking and I think that that is a very positive signThe Trump administration has developed close relations with Saudi Arabia which was President Trumps first stop on  in May He has repeatedly praised its ruler King Salman  the father of both the ambassador and the crown prince  as a wise ruler and the United States closest partner in the gulf regionAli al-Ahmed director of the Institute of Gulf Affairs a group often critical of the Saudi leadership said the decision shows the stamp of the crown prince Over the past year the government has restricted the powers of the religious police and decreed that women and men working for the government receive equal payLast weekend women were allowed for the first time into King Fahd International Stadium in Riyadh for a special pageant celebrating the 87th anniversary of Saudi Arabias founding Women are largely barred from public events because of strict prohibitions against the mixing of the sexesThe driving ban was increasingly unpopular and difficult for the ruling family to justify Ahmed said It was inevitable that it would be lifted someday Now was the time with the Saudi economy struggling with low oil prices and the monarchy facing some internal pressuresLast year the well-known Saudi investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal al-Saud a member of the royal family declared that the kingdoms refusal to allow women to drive was draining billions of dollars from the sagging economyThe governments reform plan introduced last year by the crown prince is designed to diversify the oil-dependent economy It calls for increasing the role of Saudi women including boosting their participation in the workforce from 22percent to 30percent by 2030Last month a woman was appointed the chief executive of a major Saudi bank  a first in the countrys history That came a few days after Saudi Arabias stock exchange appointed a woman as its chairNot everyone is likely to be pleased by the lifting of the driving ban One cleric Sheikh Saad al-Hijri the head of fatwas or legal opinions in Asir province said in a recent lecture that women dont deserve to drive because they only have a quarter of a brainLast Thursday the BBC reported Hijri was banned by the government from preaching leading prayers and other religious activities Brian Murphy in Washington Souad Mekhennet in London Kareem Fahim in Istanbul and Sudarsan Raghavan in Cairo contributed to this reportSaudi Arabias King Salman elevated his 31-year-old son Wednesday to become crown prince ousting his nephew in a seismic shift in the royal succession line that could have deep ramifications for the oil-rich monarchy and the broader Middle EastSince Prince Mohammed bin Salman emerged from obscurity two years ago his impact has been widely felt in Saudi Arabia and across the region He is seen as a modernizer of his hidebound kingdom and a champion of its frustrated youth But he is also a forceful and some say hotheaded advocate for Saudi Arabias regional dominance who has thrust the country into bitter feuds with neighbors as well as involvement in a destructive civil war in YemenBecause of his youth  and his fathers age (81)  the new crown prince is poised to play a pivotal role in forging the policy and identity of this key US ally and the Arab worlds largest economy But he also faces numerous obstacles in implementing his vision for a new Saudi Arabia analysts saidOn Wednesday after a flurry of royal decrees Salman replaced Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef who was also relieved of his influential position as interior minister in which he oversaw security and counterterrorism operations The new crown prince will become the kingdoms first deputy prime minister while retaining his control of the Defense Ministry and other portfoliosThe surprise announcement marks the first time since Saudi Arabias first ruler King Abdul Aziz ibn Saud that a Saudi monarch has designated his son rather than a brother as his heir apparent And it is only the second time since the kingdom was founded in 1932 that a grandson of ibn Saud has been named crown prince  and its potential future king The move also consolidates power within King Salmans family while weakening the influence of the families of his brothers and their sons  The reshuffle marks the first real test of the ruling Al Saud familys ability to manage the inevitable generational shift from the sons of Ibn Saud to his grandsons Torbjorn Soltvedt a Middle East analyst at Verisk Maplecroft a global risk consulting firm said in a statementThe change arrives at a critical time for the Sunni-ruled Muslim kingdom as it grapples with the economic fallout from declining oil prices and a costly military campaign it leads against Shiite rebels in neighboring Yemen The kingdom also is heading a bloc of Arab nations that has begun a controversial campaign to isolate the tiny Persian Gulf nation of Qatar accusing it of supporting and financing terrorismThe White House said President Trump congratulated the new crown prince in a phone call Wednesday and discussed the priority of cutting off all support for terrorists It said they also talked about how to resolve the dispute with Qatar and achieve Israeli-Palestinian peace  The ascension of Mohammed bin Salman along with other recent appointments by his father completes a shift to a younger generation of leaders within the ruling family one that could bring economic and social change to a nation where women are forbidden to drive cinemas are banned and coffee shops are segregated by gender The young prince already is promoting a plan to create jobs for women and modernize a society in which nearly two-thirds of the population is younger than 30 and women make up 22percent of the workforceWeve seen the shift of power coming for some time and the steady centralization of power under King Salman and the purview of his son said Kristin Smith Diwan a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in WashingtonEven as deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman  popularly known as MBS  was given immense powers by his father As defense minister he runs the Saudi campaign in Yemen As the head of an economic council he has overseen efforts to revamp the kingdoms energy policies and build a diverse economy that will sustain itself long after the countrys oil reserves have run out  Most members of the Saudi royal family supported the princes ascension erasing any remote fear of a challenge to the new crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef himself publicly pledged his loyalty to the new crown prince in a well-choreographed televised momentThe crown princes rise some analysts said has been in the works for several months A series of decrees in April propelled young royals in their 30s into influential diplomatic and national security positions while undermining Mohammed bin Nayefs power Together the appointments represent a generational makeover of a system once dominated by much older and more experienced royalsThis new generations loyalty is by all accounts to the rising prince Joseph Bahout an analyst at the Carnegie Endowments Middle East Program wrote in a May postSince his father came to power in January 2015 Mohammed bin Salman has been brash outspoken and ambitious Unlike many Saudi princes who attended elite Western universities the crown prince was educated in Saudi Arabia and does not speak English fluently He favors wearing sandals over loafers But his homegrown credentials have made him popular among many Saudis especially younger onesHe is said to allow his views to be challenged  but does not change them Simon Henderson a Middle East expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy wrote on the groups website His greatest strength or weakness may be his ruthlessnessToday he has the ear of his father and the kingdoms business communityIn 2016 he introduced a post-petrodollar plan that included selling off some of the oil giant Saudi Aramco and creating a sovereign wealth fund to rival those of neighboring Qatar and the United Arab Emirates But the blueprint also brought complaints from a society that has become accustomed to cradle-to-grave largesse from the Saudi state Among the belt-tightening measures was a cut in subsidies for gasoline and electricity  The crown prince is the main driver behind Vision 2030 a far-reaching blueprint to overhaul the Saudi economy and society focused on live concerts arts festivals and other forms of Western-style entertainment But such efforts have also brought complaints from conservative SaudisRegionally said Diwan the crown princes rise almost certainly means the continuation of a more assertive Saudi policy abroad and a strong alliance with the UAE in pursuing those policies Both have shared goals of rolling back Iranian influence and taking stronger action against independent political Islamist movements such as the Muslim BrotherhoodThe crown prince is already the kingdoms primary liaison with the Trump administration and his ascension is widely expected to improve ties with Washington Relations were strained under President Barack Obama over Iran and a 2015 nuclear dealIn Yemen the crown prince is the architect of the faltering and bloody Saudi military intervention that has led to thousands of civilian deaths The kingdoms hard-line stance on Qatar which the new crown prince backs is also becoming a point of tension with WashingtonMeanwhile the prince has been courting Russia sensing an opportunity to use oil diplomacy to lure Moscow away from IranAnd assessments of the crown prince as a reformer by the kingdoms standards did not mean that he would deviate from policies that have been condemned by human rights advocates as brutal including mass executionsThe reality is Prince Mohammed has stood alongside and publicly defended the king as young men have been tortured and executed for peacefully protesting said Maya Foa director of Reprieve an international human rights group Fahim reported from Istanbul Brian Murphy in Washington contributed to this reportNew tensions erupted Friday in a feud between Qatar and a group of Arab nations led by Saudi Arabia after the leak of an onerous list of demands to be met by Qatar including the shuttering of its popular Al Jazeera news channelSaudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Egypt and Bahrain  portraying the action as stemming from Qatars support for extremist groups The increasingly poisonous rift has split much of the region elicited confused responses from the United States  a close ally to every party in the dispute  and revealed divides within the Trump administration  A list of demands by the Saudi-led bloc  first revealed by the Associated Press on Friday  included requirements that Qatar scale back its diplomatic relations with Iran close down a Turkish military base in Qatar and sever ties with terrorist organizations including the Muslim Brotherhood the Islamic State militant group and Lebanons Hezbollah Some of the 13 demands addressed long-standing concerns over Qatari support for extremist groups in Syria Libya and elsewhere But others including a vague requirement that Qatar pay compensation for its policies and shut down allnews outlets the country operates appeared designed to punish Qatar for its independence from the Saudi-led blocIt was unclear whether the list represented a draft for discussion a bargaining position or a formal demand A spokesman for Qatars government Sheikh Saif al-Thani said that his government was reviewing the demands but added that the list as well as the blockade imposed by the Arab states on his country has nothing to do with combatting terrorism it is about limiting Qatars sovereignty and outsourcing our foreign policyThe foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates Anwar Gargash writing on Twitter blamed the leak on Qatar and called it either an attempt to undermine serious mediation or yet another sign of callous policy  The four countries severed ties with Qatar soon after a visit by President Trump to Saudi Arabia His visit was intended to rally Persian Gulf allies of the United States to take a common stand against extremism and Iranian influence Trump appeared to support the move During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology Leaders pointed to Qatar - look he wrote on TwitterOther American officials including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have favored a less confrontational approach and called for mediation with Qatar which hosts the regional headquarters of the US Central Command the base of air operations for the fight against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq Earlier this week the State Department issued an unusually scalding rebuke of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates saying they have taken too long to publicly lay out their complaints Qatar appeared likely to dismiss many of the demands including the shuttering of the landmark Al Jazeera television and its affiliates Since its founding in 1996 the Qatari-owned channel hasattracted praise and controversy for its frank discussions of delicate topics its wide coverage of the US-led military campaignsin Iraq and Afghanistan and its reporting on the Arab uprisings that started in late 2010In recent years especially the Arabic-language channel has become closely associated with Qatars promotion of the Muslim Brotherhood and other Sunni Islamists around the region including those who have advanced extremist or sectarian views on the channel The networks highly regarded English-language channel is seen as far more independent than its Arabic counterpart The list of demands heavily reflected its sponsors preoccupation with any challenges to their ruleStop all contacts with the political opposition in Saudi Arabia the UAE Egypt and Bahrain the list said according to drafts that were circulatedHand over all files detailing Qatars prior contacts with and support for those opposition groups  Heba Farouk Mahfouz in Cairo and Heba Habib in Stockholm contributed to this reportJust as the Dallas Cowboys were prepared to begin life without Ezekiel Elliott for six games albeit reluctantly the second-year running back received another legal reprieve For a third time a federal court intervened to keep Elliott eligible to play for the CowboysThe US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on Friday granted the NFL Players Associations request to keep Elliotts suspension by the NFL on hold pending the unions appeal on Elliotts behalf of a judges ruling MondayThe development clears the way for Elliott to play in the Cowboys game at home Sunday against the Kansas City ChiefsThe NFLPAs appeal is to be heard by a three-judge panel of the appeals court US District Court Judge Katherine Polk Failla on Monday denied the unions request for a preliminary injunction on Elliotts behalf  The on-again off-again suspension is off again for the third time The NFL has been prevented all season from enforcing its six-game suspension of Elliott under the personal conduct policyA federal judge in Texas granted the NFLPAs request for a preliminary injunction for Elliott That was overturned by a federal appeals court in New Orleans which ruled that the district court in Texas did not have proper jurisdiction because the union filed its lawsuit before Elliotts appeal was resolved by NFL-appointed arbitrator Harold HendersonThe case shifted to New York where the league had filed a lawsuit seeking to affirm Hendersons ruling upholding the suspension A judge granted Elliott and the NLFPA a temporary restraining order which remained in effect until Mondays ruling by Failla  The union is appealing that ruling by Failla denying an injunction and Fridays development came in response to the NFLPAs request for an emergency injunction pending that appeal and an administrative stay of Faillas decision to permit Elliott to play SundayThe Cowboys have a record of 4-3 and Elliott has been extremely productive recently totaling 413 rushing yards in the teams past three games He ran for 150 yards in last Sundays 33-19 triumph over the Washington Redskins in the rain and wind at FedEx FieldElliott attended the hearing Monday in New York and was not with the Cowboys this week Coach Jason Garrett said at a news conference Wednesday that he had not at that point spoken to Elliott since immediately following the game at Washington The Cowboys spent the week preparing to split time and carries at running back between Alfred Morris Darren McFadden and Rod SmithWe have great confidence in the guys that are gonna play in his place Garrett said Wednesday Alfred Morris and Darren McFadden and Rod Smith will all get opportunities to carry the football for us in different situations  Theyve had success in this league Obviously Alfred is somebody that has been productive as a runner in this league Darren was very productive for us a couple years ago And we feel really good about Rod Smith and how hes developed and the role that he can play for us All those guys will play and well just keep going down the roadIf Elliotts suspension had remained in effect this week he would have missed Sundays game against the Chiefs and subsequent games against the Atlanta Falcons Philadelphia Eagles Los Angeles Chargers Redskins and New York Giants He next would have been eligible to play in a Dec 17 game at OaklandThe risk that the Cowboys and Elliott now take is that if the suspension stands but is delayed further Elliott could miss games later in the season and even more important to the team League officials have said that the NFL would enforce Elliotts suspension during the postseason if necessaryCowboys owner Jerry Jones said after the Redskins game Zeke is critical to our [team] As you can see hes a valued membermember is almost trite to say We need himPlenty has been said already about the Cleveland Browns  for Cincinnati Bengals quarterback AJ McCarron The deal was in place but the Browns failed to provide proper notification to the league by the 4 pm trade deadline and the transaction was disallowed Executives with other NFL teams are saying they consider the Browns actions inexcusable The coverup of blaming the league or the Bengals is only making it worse one saidFormer longtime Cowboys executive Gil Brandt wrote on Twitter Someone challenged me to say something positive about this Browns team Honestly I didnt know how to answerThis weeks gaffe which comes after the decisions to pass over Carson Wentz and Deshaun Watson in the last two NFL drafts and amid the teams 1-23 record since the start of last season is said by some within the league to have incensed Browns ownership There is a growing feeling among executives with other franchises that Browns owner Jimmy Haslam cannot allow this group of decision-makers to select the teams next quarterbackThe NFL generally has made good and reasonable decisions this season in handing out suspensions to players for illegal hits But the decision not to suspend Miami Dolphins linebacker Kiko Alonso for his hit on Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco during last weeks Thursday night game was odd Yes it can be argued that Alonso had committed to hitting Flacco before Flacco began to slide at the end of a run But while NFL rules say that a quarterback can be hit under those circumstances they also say that he cannot be hit in the head Thats precisely what Alonso did knocking Flacco  The hit was illegal and frankly egregious It deserved an ejection And when that didnt happen it merited a suspension given the NFL competition committees recommendation that flagrant illegal hits should result this season in the offending player being ejected or suspendedBrowns wide receiver Josh Gordon who was  this week last played in a regular season game on Dec 21 2014 With his suspensions and off-field issues its easy to forget how great Gordon was in 2013 He played in only 14 games that year and had 1646 receiving yards the 13-best single-season total in NFL historyBuffalos general manager Brandon Beane said he considers wide receiver Anquan Boldin retired at this point The Bills have Boldin on their reserve-retired list and dont intend to release him because of wariness that he could sign with New England or Miami The Bills did not deal Boldin by Tuesdays leaguewide deadline after granting him permission to explore a tradeBrock Osweiler gets the start at quarterback and tries to save the Broncos season Yes it has come to that for Denver Elliott remains eligible to play but was not part of the Cowboys preparations during the week Will that have an effectAndrew Luck vs Deshaun Watson Nope Jacoby Brissett vs Tom Savage No thanksNo Jimmy Garoppolo (yet) for the Niners So no reason to pay attentionThe US Secret Service followed atypical protocol with Hillary Clintons early departure from Sundays commemoration of the 15th anniversary of the 9/11terrorist attacks at Ground Zero of the Democratic presidential nominees departure from the ceremony Clinton can be seen leaning against a security bollard and then buckling and stumbling as her security detail helps her into a black van Clintons campaign said she had suffered from overheatingAccording to two former Secret Service agents who reviewed the video the detail clearly had to rush and did not expect Clinton to leave at that timeThey said the Service generally prefers for the protected individual not to wait for a car to arrive although that has happened before In the video Clinton is leaning against the bollard as a black van pulls upOne former agent said the risk of waiting was diminished considerably on Sunday by the thick bubble of security surrounding the commemoration Protective details for Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and other city officials were also on handIt is also unusualfor a detail leader to leave the protected individuals side as a Secret Service agent Todd Madison is seen doing in the video to open the vans doors Opening the van is typically left to another agent But because of the rushed nature of the departure one of the former agents said another rule of Secret Service protection appears to have carried the day Whoever is closest to the door must open itEvery once in a while you have to call an audible one of the former agents said We follow a methodology not a scriptThe video also shows a dense thicket of agents closing around behind Clinton giving her 360 degree coverage  another mainstay of Service protectionSecret Service spokeswoman Cathy Milhoan issued the following statement later Sunday During the early departure today of one of our protectees at no time did any Secret Service personnel violate security protocolsMilhoan later added The Secret Service is confident in the actions taken by its Protective Detail earlier todayThe incident also raised questions about Clintons traveling group of reporters which she left behind at Ground Zero when she departed unexpectedly leaving the press with no knowledge of her whereabouts or condition for about 90 minutesClinton travels with a small group of reporters and photographers representing broadcast and print outlets The arrangement called a pool approximates the rotating group of press outlets that travel with the presidentTrump has no such pool a break with past candidates He had no reporters with him Sunday when he appeared unannounced at the same memorial ceremony Clinton attendedClinton resisted very close contact with her pool over the summer consenting only to travel on her own small jet in tandem with the pool and not allowing the same kind of full-time coverage customary at the White HouseStarting on Labor Day Clinton began traveling on the same large campaign plane with her Secret Service detail and reporters and the pool has had greater access to some of her events including a fund-raising party in New York on Friday night that featured Barbra Streisand At that event Clinton stirred controversy byreferring to some Trump supporters as deplorablesIn the White House model a so-called protective pool is on constant standby each day until given an all-clear that the president will not have any further public events or outingsThat model has been followed more closely by presidential candidates in the pastClinton is not allowing door-to-door pool coverage in which the pool group would assemble at her home and travel with her from there Instead pool reporters have met up with Clinton at her plane or elsewhere On Sunday the pool was left behind both when Clinton departed the memorial and when she departed daughter Chelsea Clintons apartment The pool was later driven separately to Westchester County where the Democratic nomineelivesRobert Gibbs President Obamas first White House press secretary suggested in a tweet Sunday that its time for Clinton to adopt a more formal protective poolProtective pool isnt always easy for either candidate or press but there comes a point for each nominee when it must be part of daily life he saidSen Bob Corker (R-Tenn) who is emerging as a finalist in the search for Donald Trumps running mate met privately with the presumptive GOP nominee on Tuesday in New York and was scheduled to later fly with the candidate to Raleigh NCLooking forward to meeting with [Corker] in a little while We will be traveling to North Carolina together today Trump wrote on TwitterThe meeting was held at Trump Tower Trumps Manhattan skyscraper and served as an opportunity for him to bond with Corker  the chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee  as he evaluates his short list Corker last visited Trump Tower in MayThe day of conversation and travel with Trump comes as Corker is being formally vetted for the vice-presidential nomination by Washington lawyerAB Culvahouse Jr In recent weeks Corker has provided documents to Culvahouse and been in close touch with top Trump advisers according to two Republicans familiar with the selection process  Culvahouse a former White House counsel has deep roots in Tennessee politics going back to his time as an aide to Howard Baker who was a senator and a towering figure in state history Culvahouse has known Corker for yearsThe Republicans spoke on the condition of anonymity becausethe details of Corkers talks with Trump and of his vice-presidential vetting have been closely guarded by campaign officials Spokesmen for Trump and Corker were unreachable for comment TuesdayBut one Republican described the rapport between Trump and Corker as natural and strong even if they arent the closest of friends and said they share maverick instincts and an aversion to the hawkish tilt on foreign policy that has dominated their partyTrump has publicly stated for months that he appreciates Corkers willingness to defend parts of his non-traditional approach to foreign policy and to argue his case to wary colleagues in the Senate cloakroomCorker 63 has in recent years become a central figure in policy negotiations with the Obama administrationespecially during the debate overtheUS-Iran nuclear deal when he offered a proposal whichthe administration opposed for Congress to review and vote on the pactHe previously served as mayor of Chattanooga TennStill even though Corker isat Trumps side Tuesday he is far from the only contender to be on the ticket Former House speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie are being vetted by Culvahouse and Indiana Gov Mike Pence met with Trump on Saturday at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster NJ And Sen Joni Ernst (Iowa) met with Trump on Monday also in New JerseyTrumps event in Raleigh on Tuesday evening will be at the Memorial Auditorium at the Duke Energy Center for the Performing Arts hours after President Obama and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton appeared before a cheering crowd of supporters in CharlotteHe was giving an example which is obvious that when the currency fluctuates as it does  more Americans are going to be able to travel to the UK more cheaply Corker said on CNNs State of the Union on Sunday Some of their exports may go at greater value I thought it was just demonstrating you know an anecdotal statement relative to its effect[]Corker whom many top Republicans consider a contender to be Trumps running mate added that Trumps Scotland event which coincided with the Brexit voteI know Im an outlier based on polling that I have seen you do but I thought it was one of his best events Corker said I mean here he was as a businessperson an outsider He happened to be in the country right after the Brexit vote had taken place supporting his children and demonstrating that he was an outsiderSen Bob Corker (R-Tenn) announced recently and that seems to have freed him up to speak more candidly about the Trump administrationAnd speak more candidly he did on WednesdayIn a conversation with reporters Corker responded to  that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had to be talked out of resigning after disagreements with President Trump Corker who as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has worked extensively with Tillerson said he wouldnt disclose sensitive conversations that the two might have hadBut then he launched into a pretty stunning bit of commentary onthe Trump administration He basically suggested that there would be chaos if not for the likes of Tillerson and the two generals serving as top officialsHeres the full context of Corkers remarks ( added)CORKER I dont talk about private conversations with anyone Inappropriately I dont anyway  and I support them very much And I dont know what he may have said after the briefing I watch from  I mean look  And thats just from my vantage point But Ive never  you know I have no knowledge of the comments or anything else I think hes in a very trying situationtrying to solve many of the worlds problems a lot of times without the kind of support and help that Id like to see him haveQ Did he ever think about resigning at any pointCORKER I cant get into thatQ When you say that Tillerson Mattis and Kelly are separating this country from chaos do you mean from the presidents chaosCORKER Well its just they act in a very   You know I hope they stay because theyre valuable to the national security of our nation theyre valuable to us putting forth good policies theyre very valuable as it relates to our citizens feeling safe and secure and I hope hes here for a very long timeThe videoconveys his views evenmore clearly than the transcriptCorker isnt completely new to criticizing Trump In August the senator turned heads when he said  nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order for him to be successful Thatearned him But the latest comments take it much further Suggesting that there would be chaos if not for the generals and Tillerson is to suggest that not only is Trump not a steady leader but that things are basically ready to unravel behind the scenes This reinforces a whole lot of reporting and what a whole lot of people already believe about the administration but its striking to hear it directly from a GOP senator who  has talked to Trumpmore than any other senatorCorker also didnt dispute that he was talking about Trump when he referenced chaos He seemed to be choosing his words carefully and he even laughed nervously when he made the other people in the administration commentBut when Corker says that Tillerson is not being supported in the way I would hope a secretary of state would be its difficult not to attach that to Trumps reportedly limited interaction with Tillerson Their relationship has seemed frayed for a while now most recently culminating in Trumps very s announcement of talks with North Korea last weekGiven that Corkers past commentary on Trump and what Corker said Wednesday its pretty clear whom he was talking about when he referenced chaosWhen a United States senator particularly one as powerful and secure as Sen Bob Corker (R-Tenn) next year someobvious next questions areDoes his desire to leave have anything to do with Washington And will others decide to exit too potentially changing the balance of power in WashingtonThe answers arent entirely clear When and whether to leave a job is an extremely personal decision Corker said in his retirement statement that he initially ran for the Senate intent onserving just two termsWhen I ran for the Senate in 2006 I told people that I couldnt imagine serving for more than two terms Understandably as we have gained influence that decision has become more difficult But I have always been drawn to the citizen legislator model and while I realize it is not for everyone I believe with the kind of service I provide it is the right one for me(But its worth noting the environment that Corker who chairs the powerful Foreign Relations Committee and was once a Trump foreign policy adviser and potential vice presidential contender is leavingRepublicans control Congress for the first time in a decade but instead of coming together theyve devolved into several factions that have made it nearly impossible to deliver on their central campaign promise for the past seven yearsHeck Corkers retirement announcement comes on the same day that Senate leaders acknowledged they would not be voting on a last-ditch effort to repeal Obamacare because they didnt have enough votesA conservative website editor and Trump confidant has  and is considering actively trying to oust key senators Corker has two nominal primary challengers His retirement also comes on the same day thata former judgewho waskicked off the state Supreme Court  despite the party spending millions against himOn top of all this Republicans have a president who doesnt share many of their conservative values who often distracts from their accomplishments with controversy and who shows little to no interest on policyAt least one controversy clearly irked CorkerThe president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful Corker told local reporters in August after Trump appeared to equate white supremacist marchers in Charlottesville with counterprotestersIn short things arent going smoothly for Republicans right now Its entirely possible even likely that all of this factored in Corkers decisionWhatever his reason his retirement isnt good news for RepublicansTrump won Tennessee by 26 points in November so Corkers seat is probably safe especially since Rep Marsha Blackburn (R) and Gov Bill Haslam (R) are rumored to want it There is a Democratic candidate running there and Washington Democrats say theyre closely monitoring the race But trying to win an open seat is much more difficult than helping a senator get reelectedPlus Corkers retirement could motivate other senators unhappy with the state of affairs to reasses their life choices GOP strategists told The Fix that more retirements are coming especially in the HouseAlready half a dozen House Republicans have retired this year without another job lined up Several have suggested the partys climate is a big reason why It was just a realization that I could keep getting elected but its not about getting elected said Rep Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla) when she announced her retirement in AprilRetirements in the House could put their majority at risk The Senate where Republicans hold 52 of 100 seats is less endangered But more retirements means more work Republicans have to do to stave off insurgent primary challengers instead of taking advantage of a very friendly 2018 playing field to pick up more seatsThere are retirements every year and its a mistake to read too much into them said GOP strategist Alex Conant But I do hear that more retirements are coming and at some point it makes maintaining the majorities more challengingRetirement makes it more likely that a far-right candidate wins a GOP primary and assuming that person wins the general it makes it more difficult for [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell (R-Ky) to manage his majority said Molly Reynolds a congressional expert at the Brookings InstitutionThats all possible not probable But its much more possible now that a prominent establishment Republican is retiring rather than staying in a divided Congress Republican leaders themselves frustrated right now are surely asking themselves Will others follow Corker out the door If so its the last thing Republicans need right nowOn Sunday Japans Liberal Democratic Party won a  winning284 of the 465 seats in the lower house of the Diet Prime Minister Shinzo Abes junior coalition partner added 29 seatsgiving the ruling coalition a two-thirds supermajorityIn addition to freeing the LDP from a mandatory ballot challenge before 2021 Abes election victory provides new support for his efforts to Abe went into the election arguing that his track record on the economy and  should be the decisive factor and voters appear to have agreed Japan faces new security challenges from two of its neighbors  have passed over Japan twice in recent months leaving Japanese citizens rattled by early-morning text alerts And at the recent Communist Party Congress in Beijing President Xi Jinping promised that China would be  raising additional concerns in JapanJust one month ago the LDP appeared to be facing a serious challenge from Tokyo Gov Yuriko Koikes newly formed  Yet Koikes party secured just 50 seats and came in a disappointing third place behind the new Constitutional Democratic Party which won 55 seats The CDP was formed from the left-leaning remains of the Democratic Party of Japan after its more conservative members defected to Koikes party  The ruling coalitions supermajority ensures not only that Abe will remain in power but also that he can now push for a his personal pledge and an unfulfilled element of the LDP platform since 1955 Although many in the public remain skeptical of the constitutional revision plan the LDPs success in this election represents an endorsement of the ruling coalitions governing ability particularly on security issuesThe same week that Japanese voters went to the polls they saw Xi promise more assertiveness at Chinas 19th party congress reinforcing Abes message about the need for steady leadership in Tokyo Abes support was also buoyed by North Koreas missile and nuclear tests  and no doubt by North Korean leader Kim Jong Uns threats in September to Japan has worked closely with the Trump administration on sanctioning North Korea and is a leading US ally on missile defense Tokyo is likely to introduce additional  capabilities such as Aegis Ashore or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense systems in the near future given that the LDP has supported additional defense spending for these purposes  There may also be debates within the ruling coalition on the need for Japan to deploy its own surface-to-surface missiles to enhance deterrence vis-a-vis North Korea Abe has not taken a public stand on these  which would to give Japan the ability to neutralize North Korean ballistic missiles on their launchpads This would be an abrupt change from a  that has remained strictly defensive with few offensive capabilitiesAbe will also continue  on Japans air and naval capabilities in an attempt to counter Chinas much higher spending on the Peoples Liberation Army The  of fighter aircraft and surface combatants has been steadily shifting in Chinas favor for decadesMore recently however Xi has begun streamlining the PLA to strengthen its war-fighting effectiveness in preparation for a potential conflict in the Western Pacific Abe knows that maintaining deterrence will require closer cooperation with the United States and continued reforms to break down the  to the effectiveness of Japans own forcesThe biggest obstacle to Japan developing a more normal military is of the countrys postwar constitution Under Article 9 Japan renounces the right of war to resolve international disputes and forswears the possession of ground naval and air forces for that purposeTwo years ago Abe pushed through a reinterpretation of the constitution to allow new defense guidelines and operations with the United States and other like-minded states Many in his party support revising the second half of Article 9 to declare that  though intended only for self-defenseSupport from pacifist-leaning coalition partner Komeito will probably be forthcoming and friendly governments such as the United States and Australia are likely to be supportive as well China will protest as might South Korea but  suggest that Japan has moved beyond its wartime image Nevertheless Article 9is highly political and ideological Abe will have to carry out his promise to build domestic consensus before proceeding Despite President Trumps harsh rhetoric about Japan during his election campaign Abe has deftly  in Washington and managed to build significant trust with Trump Abe was the first foreign leader to visit Trump and Trump will start his first Asia tour by spending several days in Japan in NovemberTrumps tough line on North Korea is likely to be well received in Japan but his hostile view toward trade (particularly the rejection of the ) continues to perplex Tokyo Japanese leaders argue that allies should  to manage the  from China  Overall the LDPs election success is likely to maintain the opportunity for US leaders to strengthen the alliance with Japan However their effectiveness will be determined by the ability to identify concrete steps to push the alliance forwardStrong leadership in Tokyo is a critical piece of the puzzle but it will have to be matched by clear direction from Washington if the allies are to truly bolster their relationships amid a worsening set of regional

Twitter Weinstein is a huge Hollywood mogul To not even mention in Update was curiousRepresentatives for Saturday Night Live did not respond to requests for comment Sunday morningPresident Trump promised to cut taxes for the middle class but some would end up paying more under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Actaccording to a  released Friday night by Congresss Joint Committee on Taxation the official scorekeepers tasked with determininghow much any tax legislation would add to the debt and how it would impact the poor middle class and wealthyThe Trump administration says it has abright line test that the president wont support any tax bill that does not give the middle class relief on their taxes The Tax Cuts And Jobs Act that House Republicans released Thursday appears to violate that vow at least for some middle-class taxpayersThe JCT found that the GOP bill would add to the debt over the next decade and that on average families earning between $20000 and $40000 a year and between

at helping the middle class expire in 2023 including the  Republicans are currently debating whether to extend this credit but that would require revenue from somewhere else Some are banking on Congress not allowing the credit to expire when the time comes Upper middle-class families are also losing popular tax breaks like the state and local income tax (SALT) deduction which may explain why

families  its also to make our economy boom again said the Republican-led House Ways and Means Committee in a statement Saturday Unfortunately JCTs analysis omits the economic effects of tax reform in

Millionaires get 22% boost in income without even counting estate tax Middle class gets far less or nothing  Lily Batchelder (@lilybatch) Trump and congressional Republicans argue that business tax cuts would also help the middle class because companies will create more jobs and pay workers moreThe Tax Foundation a right-leaning think tank that the GOP bill would result in almost a million more full-time jobs and that wages would rise for many workersThe larger economy and higher wages are due chiefly to the significantly lower cost of capital under the proposal which is mainly due to the lower corporate income tax rate the Tax Foundation wrote in a report FridayJCT also took a close look at what happens to peoples incomes after taking into account the business tax cuts JCT found that more Americans would be better off but some families especially in the $20000 to $40000 range would still see tax increases after 2023 JCT assumes about a quarter of the tax savings that businesses receive would end up in the pockets of workers because of higher wages Wealthier families also benefit from higher stock dividends and changes to small businesses taxesThere are winners and losers in any tax billIn general large families and those that currently take a lot of deductions for medical expenses or state and local taxes are hurt the most by the changes in the GOP plan Some are already

administration has been vocal about exercising  including  to halt North Koreas nuclear ambition Moon has stated he is not opposed to sanctions But by seeking  promoting an economic community and

advice for the guy who was supposed to crush him in the GOP primary for Virginia governorEd if youre listening to this Nobody cares that your dad owned a grocery store Nobody cares that your ancestors were immigrants Stewart chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors and at one time chair of Donald Trumps Virginia campaign said in an interview with The Washington PostNobody cares about that because everybody in that room has a similar story I havent met any person who has been inspired by Eds story of growing up in a grocery storeThe Ed in question is Ed Gillespie the former lobbyist and Republican National Committee chairman whose stump speech includes a bit of his up-by-the-bootstraps biography Gillespie had been expected to win Virginias June 13 gubernatorial primary in a blow-out It turned out to be a nail-biter with Gillespie edging out Stewart by a measly 12 percentage points  In his first sit-down with the Post since the primary Stewart said this week that he has no regrets about the provocative Confederate-centric campaign strategy that had led political observers to write him off as a fringe candidate The approach he noted earned him tons of free media attention and nearly propelled him to victory against a much better-funded rivalWe deliberately were at times more controversial in order to attract mainstream media in order to attract earned media he said during an hour-long interview Tuesday afternoon at his county officeHe said he might pick a different issue to hammer if he  But hell definitely stick with the hard-hitting attention-grabbing approach  Stewart said he hasnt spoken to Gillespie since the primary and hasnt endorsed him but does plan to vote for him He had loads of free advice for the nominee who he called boring and lacking in passion Along with the grocery-store bio Stewart says Gillespie should ditch the dorky Mister Rogers sweater that is a staple of his campaign ads  If you dont have the passion your followers will not have the passion and thats his challenge Stewart said You have to juice it up somehow Hes going to have to make it a little more stimulating When you look at one of Eds speeches its boring It doesnt really hit the heartTeam Gillespie took the advice in stride Ed gets a lot of campaign advice from people and is always open to new ideas said Gillespie spokesman David AbramsIf it is any consolation for the GOP nominee and his backers Stewart was just as harsh toward the Democratic nominee Lt Gov Ralph NorthamNortham Stewart declared is as boring as the bottom of my shoeFor the past several weeks sexual harassmenthas becomea major topic in entertainment media and politicsPolitical leaders like President Trump and former president George HW Bush are showing up in the same conversations as members of the media who often reported on themincluding former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes anchor Bill OReilly and former MSNBC analyst Mark HalperinThe topic most recently gained traction after dozens of women went public with harassment and rape accusations against Hollywoodproducer Harvey Weinstein who $10000 tothe defense fund of former president Bill Clinton when he wasfighting legal battles surrounding his sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica LewinskyIt also has put attention back on Trump who has been accused of sexual harassment or assault by multiple womenIt is hard to reconcile that Harvey Weinstein could be brought down with this and [President] Trump just continues to be the Teflon Don said Jessica Leeds whothat she was groped 30 years ago on a plane bythe presidentTrump  the claims against him and said he was  by the allegations about WeinsteinMost people are not surprised that sexual harassment against women isnt limited to Hollywood or WashingtonA solid majority of Americans  64 percent  say that sexual harassment in the workplace is a serious problem in the United States according to a new That number was less than half  47 percent  in the 2011 pollAnd nearly two-thirds of Americans say men who sexually harass female co-workers usually get away with itMany surveys look at womens views on this issue butInstamotor  750 menacrossthe United States to hear theirexperiences with sexual harassment or assault And some of their responses were surprisingMany men arent even sure what sexual harassment is when to check-off whether a series of actions amounted to sexual harassment or assaultThe pollwas conducted using a non-probability online sample of men recruited by the survey firmPollfish rather than drawing a random sample of the public and it is unclear whether results are representative of men in the US overall The surveys question on definitionsdid not specify whetheracts occurred between coworkers where laws barring sexual harassment commonly applyNonetheless the survey found many men realize that they are surrounded by sexual harassmentNearly half  45 percent  said they have witnessed someone being sexually harassed And of those who have witnessed it half have seen harassment happen in the workplaceBut there arent many men speaking out as needed  something NPR

a significant number of the men surveyed seem unconcerned about the issue One in 4 respondents do not think the recent increase of conversations around sexual assault is justifiedI feel like we as a fantasy community arent talking enough about how crazy it is that Deshaun Watson Carson Wentz and Alex Smith are all top-five fantasy quarterbacks at this point in the seasonSince weve been watching them in 2017 weve gradually become used to them being dominant performers If you woke a guy up from a six-month coma and showed him the fantasy numbers he might fall right back into that coma Its the difference between watching a child get slowly taller every day and seeing a 6-foot-tall 15-year-old you last saw when he was a toddler Hes the same person but man is the reaction differentSo Id like to put just how crazy this is into perspective and I think Ive figured out how Watson Wentz and Smith are top-five right And if I had told you those names in 2016 youd have thought it was nuts So who would be the Watson/Wentz/Smith for 2018 Lets look at it as a declarative statementAlmost literally thats the comparison A rookie who isnt universally the top of his class the previous years No 2 overall pick and an underwhelming veteran That sentence right there is absolutely absurd beyond unreasonable a claim a serious analyst cant really make And yet thats where we are in 2017Its crazy and its been fun and do  think this is the new normal in fantasyOn to the fantasy plays Each week Im offering up a handful of good and bad fantasy situations based on the matchups the lineups and our unique data at Pro Football Focus The Kansas City Chiefs have the reputation of a dominant defense especially after making Trevor Siemian look like a high-schooler in their Monday night dominance Then again a lot of defenses have made Siemian look underqualified so that might have said more about the Denver signal-caller than it did about Kansas City The Chiefs have allowed the ninth-most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks this year and that includes basically shutting down Tom Brady and Philip Rivers in Weeks 1 and 3 respectively Since then the Chiefs have allowed 12 passing touchdowns in five games with quarterbacks averaging 212 fantasy points a game against them (yes including Siemian) This is a matchup that is scary on reputation only   Peterson had a monster debut with Arizona in Week 6 (134 yards 2 TDs 25 fantasy points) before falling flat in Week 7 (33 yards 3 fantasy points) Now without Carson Palmer out for the foreseeable future Peterson is again likely to face a situation like he did in Minnesota when an awful quarterback situation meant teams stacked the box against him and occasionally gave him a tough road to run And that could be bad for him for the rest of 2017 but for Week 9 Peterson gets a 49ers defense that has allowed 3 more fantasy points  to opposing running backs than any other team Ride Peterson for Week 9 soak up the value and then see if you can trade him before he crashes back to earth Soft factors Drake and Miami head coach Adam Gase both have something to prove this week after the team sent former starter Jay Ajayi away before Tuesdays trade deadline and that means theres every chance Drake and Damien Williams get heavy workloads as a prove-it strategy Hard factors Whatre they gonna do let Matt Moore throw the ball The Colts have played three games against teams grades 20thor worse in PFF pass-coverage grading (Tennessee San Francisco Cleveland) In those games hes totaled 15 catches on 22 targets for 349 yards and a score In the five games hes played against teams graded better than that Hilton has 14 catches on 33 targets for 178 scoreless yards Yes those good games include a one-catchfour-target 19-yard outing against the Titans but ultimately Hilton is a guy who eats when the matchup is right The Texans are PFFs 25th-graded team in pass coverage This could be a Hilton week   The Cardinals have allowed the fourth-most fantasy points to receivers That despite Patrick Peterson allowing all of 82 receiving yards and one touchdown in his coverage so far this year Teams have only targeted Peterson in coverage 22 times in seven games Goodwin left the 49ers last game against Arizona with a concussion in his absence Aldrick Robinson saw 12 targets while Pierre Garcon was Peterson-ed into a bad day Expect Goodwin to be the non-Peterson feaster in Week 9 The Giants have played seven games They have allowed eight touchdowns to tight ends  at least one in every game Higbees only career touchdown came in Week 16 of last year and hes not yet been any great shakes in 2017  14 catches for 179 yards in seven games  but in a week with Rob Gronkowski Kyle Rudolph and Hunter Henry on byes and Jordan Reed likely sidelined with an injury Higbee is a promising dart throw in a prime matchup Maybe you think after watching Deshaun Watson go crazy in Week 8 that the Seattle pass defense isnt the stalwart it once was Dont think that Before Sunday Seattle hadnt allowed a single quarterback to top 20 fantasy points in a game all season and had only let Aaron Rodgers and Marcus Mariota to even reach double-digits The Seahawks allowedfour passing touchdowns Sunday they had allowedfour all year before that Cousins with Jordan Reed likely out and a struggling group of wide receivers is more likely to fare like the pre-Watson quarterbacks than like the Texans rookie   Freeman is dealing with a shoulder injury but it isnt expected to hold him out against the Panthers Even ignoring that Freeman has been outscored by Tevin Coleman two of the last three weeks and Coleman has had as many or more carries in two of three weeks as well () On top of that Freeman and the Falcons are facing a Panthers team that has only allowed three rushing touchdowns to RBs all year and none in the last three weeks Washington has allowed four total touchdowns to wide receivers this year Three of them came in Weeks 6 and 7 when Josh Norman was sidelined and the other came in Week 1 on the most broken of all plays to Nelson Agholor Basically when Norman is on the field the entire Washington pass defense becomes one of the leagues stoutest further evidenced by Normans return in Week 8 and the Cowboys receivers putting up only 90 total yards The Seattle passing offense had a monster Week 8 but expect that to come back to earth in a big way in Week 9   Ebron had a season-best 58 yards in Week 8 Hes back on track Yeah maybe good luck Mr Optimistic Guy but at the same time in Week 9 he faces the Packers who are the only team that has not yet allowed a touchdown to tight ends The Packers in fact have only allowed 236 yards to tight ends across all seven games Ebron might turn a corner down the stretch but Week 9 is decisively not the week to buy back inJust last month a White House aidethe media that President Trumps attendanceat a summit of Muslim leaders in the Saudi capital had

hosts a number ofAmerican university campuses and a vast US military base that is critical to counterterrorism operations in Iraq and Syria Yet Trump fresh from his trip to Riyadh seemed to giddily join the Saudi and UAE bandwagonDuring my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology Leaders pointed to Qatar - look Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off They said they would take a hard line on funding Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) extremism and all reference was pointing to Qatar Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) This raised eyebrows for quite a few reasons First its a bit much to single out Qatar for not doing enough to curb terrorism when similar accusations can be leveled at its neighbors perhaps especially Saudi ArabiaSuch is the nature of the Middle East that while it is entirely true that the Qataris are difficult partners and pursue unsavory policies that does not make them all that different from any of Washingtons other Middle Eastern allies  All of these countries have questionable records on human rights and some have distinguished themselves as incubators of extremism People who live in glass houses should not throw stones except thats exactly what happens in the Middle EastSome critics suggest the real impetus for the move is Saudi and UAE irritation with Qatars Al Jazeera which embraced democratic struggles across theArab world in keeping with Dohas own tacit support for the Islamist political parties emerging in various countriesNot content with muzzling their own media they want to shut down all media that reveals the

large swath of the foreign policy and national security community who believe that Qatar has been a reliable albeit complicated ally supporting US military operations Isolating and punishing Qatar runs counter to the goal ofgetting its leadership to address US concerns their argument goesQatars  are mostly keen on punishing a country that wont get in line withthe broader neoconservative project to contain Iran a goal championed by the Saudis and cheered on by Trump But the current crisis is achieving the opposite creating new fault lines between Arabs and pushing Qatar potentially closer to IranBy not leaving diplomatic space for Iran and its Arab neighbors to manage their own differences Trump has set the United States squarely alongside the House of Saud on a collision course with Irans Shiite regime a senior nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council Thats a problem argues Handjani because Trump needs Iran and its Arab neighbors to work together in finding holistic solutions for the sectarian wars that have inflamedthe Middle EastLast week German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel lamented Trumps bluster over Qatar A further escalation would serve nobody The Middle East is a political and a military powder keg said The heavy-handed approach of the Saudis and Emiratis he said is a dangerous Trumpization of regional affairsEfforts to repeal the estate tax (aka death tax) occur on an annual basis usually around tax filing season One year in 2010 the estate tax actually was repealed  but then it came back again the next year (It turned out that the taxes due at death  than with the estate tax in place) In the meantime Congress has increasingly cut the tax rate and boosted the exemptions making it less and less likely that Americans would face the taxIn 2001 for instance $675000 ($135 million for couples) of anestate was exempted from the tax before a top rate of 55 percent tax rate kicked in Now the exemption is $543 million (nearly $11 million for couples) and tax rate is 40 percent on any amount after that So the effective rate for most estates facing a tax is significantly lower than 40 percentThese exemptions have made a huge difference in terms of who gets affected In 2000 2 percent of estates had to pay taxes in 2013 just 018 percent had to pay taxes  Put another way there were 52000 taxable estate tax returns filed in 2000 and just 4687 in 2013 (In 1977 by contrast 139000 estates had to pay taxnearly 8 percent of deaths)Ironically the relatively little revenue raised by the estate tax (about $20 billion a year) has given opponents a new reason to eliminatethe taxbecause killing it would not make much of an impact on the budgetSo here we are with objectionsstill raised about the impact on farms and small businesses As in the past the concerns are bipartisan with some Democrats joining the anti-estate-tax bandwagon What does the data showBrandon Whitt is a seventh generation farmer from Murfeesboro Tenn who works with his wife and father-in-law at  which dates back to 1807 The farm is now about 483 acresafter 120 acres had to be sold in 1988 to pay the estate tax when his wifes grandmother passed away (The exemption in 1988 was $600000 and the top rate was 55 percent) So hes very concernedThe exemptions we have today are fantastic he said Dont misread me But Im much more interested in creating a level playing field for all farms and small businesses Why should one farm/business have to pay and another not just because of superficial caps put on by governmentHe said land in his area is going for $25000 to $40000 an acre because land value have soared (from $3000 to $4000 an acre in the mid-1990s) ever since a Nissan plant was built nearby though he has not had an appraisal done of his propertyUnfortunately we dont make a lot of money in this business Whitt said We would have to sell off a big part of the business to pay the taxes He said he would like to maintain the farm as an example of modern agriculture within an urbanized areaWhitt is no doubt sincere But the problem may be less than he thinksThere is special use valuation that permits ones gross estate to be reduced by an additional $1100000 (To be eligible for special use valuation the land must continue to be farmed for 10 years after death and one or more family members must continue to meet two tests  one involves participation in management and the other in most instances does not permit cash rent leasing) There are other possible discounts as well There is also a provision that allows the tax to be paid off over 15 years at low interest rates (with only interest due the first five years)The US Department of Agriculture  that with the exemptions only 06 percent of farms would have to pay an estate tax (Another 21 percent would file returns but would owe no taxes) The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center  that only 120 farms and small business where at least half the assets are in farm or business assets had to pay the estate tax in 2013Neil E Harl an Iowa State University professor who has written several volumes on the estate tax said that Whitts concerns make little sense The average land value in Iowa as of November of 2014 was $7943 and that value has dropped since by probably five to eight percent Harl said Iowa is one of the top states in terms of land values (USDA  the average value per farm acre in Tennessee is $3600 as of August 2014)In 2013 the last year IRS data are available only 660 decedents nationally reported owning any farm property Harl said However the 100 decedents with estates valued at $20000000 or more had an average of $5675730 in farm property I have been tracking this study for several years and the most striking feature is the increase in farm assets by the super wealthy In my view public policy is not servedby eliminating the federal estate tax which is the force behind this push to argue that ordinary farmers bona fide farmersare likely to pay a huge amount of federal estate tax It simply is not trueHarl added My wife and I own 1000 acres of good Iowa farmland (all but 40 acres of which was acquired the hard way  by purchase) plus other property and if one of us (or both) have to pay a little federal estate tax which is unlikely we would die with a smile on our faceThunes staff conceded that they could not identify a single farm that had been sold because of the estate tax but they said some farms had to sell acreage in order to pay the tax Moreoverthey said land prices have soared in South Dakota much faster than the estate-tax exemption which is indexed for inflation From 2013 to 2014 farm acreage in South Dakota increased in value by 225 percent to $2070 an acre more than any other state  Cropland has increased in value by 208 percent to $3430 per acre Overall land values in South Dakota have increased seven-fold since 2000Rachel Millard a spokeswoman for Thune cited a real estate surveyby South Dakota State University and USDA which showed the averagefarm in the east central part of the state was about 1400 acres with land value of $5763 in 2014 That would make the farm worth more than $8 million above the exemption for a single person she notedJodie Anderson executive director of the South Dakota Cattlemens Association also said she could not name a farm that had to be sold completely because of the estate tax But she said her family had to sell off a fairly significant amount of land to pay the tax when her grandfather died a dozenyears ago Although the estate-tax exemption has climbed in the last decade so have land values We are asset rich but cash poor she said That isanother reason why farmers are wary of the estate tax she said They do not have the resources to pay for expensive estate planningThe raw facts may not entirely support the case against the estate tax but increasingly this does not seem to matter It has become a philosophical issue even if in the end the data shows that that relatively few small farms or businesses appear to be affected Ryan said the tax hits the little guyand even if it may be only a handful thats apparently all that mattersCertainly farmers and ranchers believe they will be hit by the estate tax and do not want to be bothered with paying for lawyers to figure out ways around it Is that enough to justify throwing out a tax that now mainly affects the very wealthy who are passing on stock portfolios that have never been subject to capital gains taxes Is that better than an alternative that might require immediate payment of estates withcapital gains (as what happens in Canada where there is no estate tax)Thats for the pundits to decide We are not going to issue a Pinocchio ruling on the grounds that the issue of the estate tax has become so unmoored from the facts that it has moved into the realm of opinion But we would urge foes of the estate tax to acknowledge that thisis a problem that affects very few Americans With land values increasing some farmers may have a case But the vast majority of taxpayers never have to worry about the estate tax()To believe Donald Trump you must believe two largely contradictory thingsYou must believe that there are a slew of leakers in the executive branch who are providing damning details to the press illegally and who must be rooted out and punished (See tweets     and )You must also believe that the press makes up imaginary leakers simply to slowly and incrementally report false stories that are tangentially embarrassing to the president The most recent examples of Trump making that case came on Sunday (Whenever you see the words sources say in the fake news media and they dont mention names he said  it is very possible that those sources dont exist but are made up by fake news writers #FakeNews is the enemy) but hes been railing against this idea that some media sources are not real since the campaign (See tweets  and )The result is that we end up with a president who at 833 am  that its his opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media and then at 1043 am  that the prime minister of the United Kingdom was mad about information that was leakedTrump unlike most politicians and frankly most people will nonchalantly argue two logically inconsistent points at the same time On the campaign trail he mastered the art of vague assurance that he stood for whatever his audience stood for and in office that skill doesnt seem to have faded If it is best that people think a leak was made up by the media  like The Washington Posts report that Jared Kushner  Russia to help set up a secure communication system with the Trump team  then Trump will argue that the media made it up (We didnt) If the leak is incidental to him or if hed like to put the heat on someone else  if say someone in law enforcement leaks photos of a terrorist attack in the UK  hell argue that the leakers need to be caught  As Trump knows though there are many reasons for someone to provide information without wanting to be identified Trump himself used to call news outlets  to be his own publicist so that he could share details without revealing the source And while Trump administration officials often speak on the record to the media they nearly as often speak only on background as senior administration officials faceless voices praising Trump without being able to be held accountable for what they said It happens so often that the abbreviation SAO is understood immediately by the pressHere for example are a number of things that the White House has provided to the White House press corps using individuals who refused to be named (All quotes are from pool reports filed by members of the media)Remember dont believe sources said by the VERY dishonest media If they dont name the sources the sources dont exist Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump)  About the immigration banThe official said that Trump advisers had been in contact for many weeks with key State Department and Department of Homeland Security officials about Fridays executive order Everyone who needed to know was informed the official saidWhen the administration was forced to craft a second attempt at the ban a month after this press secretary Sean Spicer told press that the first attempt was flawed by not having enough people in place to vet itThe official said green-card holders from one of the seven affected countries who are currently outside the United States will need a case by case waiver to return to the United States according to the official Those green-card holders in the United States will have to meet with a consular officer before leaving the country the official said Immigration banThe SAO said there was no advance notice of the order going out for clear reasons that he did not explicitly outline I think everybody here can use their imagination to imagine 25 reasons why that wouldnt make sense from a security standpoint SAO saidThe SAO said that the guidance from the beginning has been that legal permanent residents (LPRs) were exempt from the immigration EO although there was some discussion about that in the roomNotice that the comment about LPRs contradicts the statement from the previous day about green-card holdersSAO praised the implementation of the order as having been done seamlessly and with extraordinary professionalismA common thread Praise for whatever the administration is doing On peace in the Middle EastThe official said a possible meeting between the Israelis and Palestinians would be part of the discussions tomorrow Hes hopeful to bring the two sides together to discuss peace the official said of the president How quickly would he like to get a Middle East peace process going I do think its a very high priority for the administration the official said who would not be pinned down on timeline A response to reports that the White House had tried to get intelligence officials to deny reports about FBI investigations[FBI assistant director] Andrew McCabe said I want you to know story in NYT (in FBI investigating contacts between Trump campaign people and Russian intel) is BS (Some question whether he said bulls or simply BS although officials best recollection is bulls) Preibus asked what can we do about this McCabe demurs and says hell get back to Preibus Preibus  concern is hes getting crushed on the story What an I supposed to doAn unnamed official relaying a conversation held within the White House is the sort of thing that Trump in other contexts has harshly criticized Conversation with German Chancellor Angela MerkelPresident Trump has been heartened by what he has heard from Berlin about devoting more resources to the annual NATO military budget POTUS intends to talk with Merkel about her government crafting a concrete plan the senior official said POTUS is very interested to get Merkels insights about working with Russian President Vladimir Putin the senior official saidAs is an unnamed person offering insight into Trumps conversations with foreign leaders Trump had a good weekThe main theme was that this has been a successful week or so for Potus on the international stage including the retaliation against Syria the summit with President Xi and todays UN vote Its difficult to portray this as anything but a really great week for the United States From the early part of Trumps first foreign tripSo I think this trip was a big success because it was unexpected It went in the heart of one of the I always say that the president is always at his best when hes doing big things that are unexpected  He was able to really go into Saudi Arabia the custodian of the holy mosques and then Donald Trump united the entire Muslim world in a way that it really hasnt been in many years So it really was very historic in that regardThe official then talked about peace in the Middle East againYou cant just walk in on Day One and sign a deal that no one has gotten done in 35 years but we thought it was very essential to look at the work over the last 100-odd days and this trip is to do a lot of listening build very strong relationships with all the different people not just the parties involves but all the people in the neighborhood The trip continuedThis official continued What Trumps doing really is increasing NATOs ability to deter any kind of aggression on its borders including from Russia The end of the tripI feel more than comfortable to say that the President had built an extraordinary rapport with the other leaders He developed great friendships It was extremely productive  This trip has left no one with any doubt about who Americas friends are and who Americas allies are and our resolution in determining the course of our future based upon upholding those alliances and friendships But ultimately we also formed new partnerships and new friendships and have created a growing consensus around the world about the need to combat the shared threat of terrorismThe SAO offered a summaryIll just implore you all whether youre talking about our successes on trade and migration in the G-7 or summit in Saudi Arabia to tell the story back home about what an unprecedentedly and historically successful trip this was by an incredible leader and an amazing man who has done extraordinary things in a very short time for the country he loves and the people of America that he serves so faithfullyAgain these are the anonymous comments of senior officials reported by the news media precisely what happens in situations that lead to stories Trump doesnt like But since Trump doesnt like those stories those anonymous sources are decried as criminals or imaginary The guys telling the press how well Trumps trip went Theyre just regular old unnamed senior officials and their word is unimpeachableCouple those SAOs with Trumps hundreds literally  of  since he came into office and his tendency to have staff make claims that he later undercuts (something he ) it seems pretty clear where the fake news originates if Trump is to be believedIncidentally for thosecurious about why Trump might think that someone would create a fictitious source to make a ridiculous claim we return to the same well weve visited so many times before His tweetsAn extremely credible source has called my office and told me that s birth certificate is a fraud Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump)The GOP tax plans changes to deductions would hit people in blue states hard with limits on popular tax deductions that would have the biggest effects on people with high property taxes and expensive homesThe tax plan doubles the standard deduction to $24000 for a married couple meaning most people wouldnt itemize their mortgage interest or property taxes But for those who do the popular mortgage interest deduction would be capped at $500000 of the loan amount for home purchases made after Nov 2 2017 instead of the current $1 million capThe deduction of state and local property taxes would be capped at $10000 and state and local income and sales taxes could no longer be deductedSome Republicans in blue states immediately expressed their opposition to the billI cannot support the current version of the tax bill because it will increase taxes for many of my constituents to subsidize tax cuts for the rest of the country Rep Peter T King (R-NY) said My job is to protect the taxpayers of Long Island and New YorkRep Lee Zeldin (R-NY) said he could not support the bill because it didnt keep the entire state and local tax deduction Eliminating the SALT deduction would be a geographic redistribution of wealth picking winners and losers Zeldin said in a statementBoth of the limits introduced in the tax plan are targeted at deductions popular in blue states If you live in New York City where you pay high taxes and where the cost of housing is pretty high this is a double whammy said Howard Gleckman a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy CenterThere arent many people with mortgages over $500000  only about 1 million mortgages or about 5 percent of mortgages that originated between 2012 and 2014 according to an analysis by the United for Homes campaign which advocates for changes to the mortgage interest deductionThose mortgages are most common in solidly blue states The District of Columbia tops the list with 27 percent of mortgages over $500000 followed by Hawaii California New York Connecticut Virginia New Jersey Maryland Massachusetts Washington and IllinoisAnything thats going to impact the sacred mortgage deduction is going to have a significant impact on home values here in Connecticut and on excitement about owning a home said Scott Cooney regional vice president for the Connecticut Association of RealtorsAn analysis by the conservative Tax Foundation found that capping the mortgage interest deduction would raise $319 billion over a decade The Tax Foundation also found that limiting the deduction would have the biggest effect in raising the taxes of people at the top of the income distribution with very modest effects for people in the middleFor people who make between about $49000 and $88000 per year the cap could reduce after-tax income byless than a tenth of a percentTendayi Kapfidze chief economist for LendingTree said that the tax plan could create an incentive for people who already own homes that cost more than $500000 to stay in them since existing homes would be grandfathered in and the new deduction limit would apply only to new home purchasesSay you own an $800000 house and youre thinking of moving or trading up If you sell your $800000 house and buy a new $800000 house youve just gotten a new tax bill Kapfidze saidThe deduction for state and local property taxes is also more commonly used in blue states  although high-income taxpayers who pay the alternative minimum tax are already barred from taking advantage of the property tax deductionAnytime youre essentially targeting state and local taxes of any kind we know that tends to zero in on the likes of New York New Jersey California  and those are states that some of the Republicans in Congress are hostile to  and its a convenient target said Mark Hamrick a senior economic analyst at BankratecomAn analysis by the Tax Foundation showed that 37 percent of filers in Connecticut took a property-tax deduction followed by Maryland New Jersey Massachusetts Virginia and OregonI think the basic thing to say about this tax bill is like most tax bills it is very political Gleckman said This is just moving stuff around raising taxes on some people cutting taxes on some people  its all politicalThe National Association of Realtors has already begun its fight against the bill with 105000 members contacting their members of Congress according to Evan Liddiard senior policy representative for federal taxationLiddiard pointed out that Republicans and Democrats alike live in areas with high property taxes or home values Were worried about the effect on middle-class homeowners and not what party they belong to Liddiard saidHouse Speaker Paul D Ryan spoke often Thursday (and) about how a typical family of four that makes $59000 a year would get a $1182 tax cut but thats only in the first year There are already serious doubts about how much the middle class benefits from the GOP plan  and for how longRyanscorrect that $59000 is  of the income spectrum Its the median income in the United States meaning half of households make more in a year and half make less Hes also right that this family would pay $1182 less than they paid in 2017 But that model family would get a tax hike by 2024 according to an by David Kamin a tax law professor at New York UniversityIts totally absurd Kamin says The tax cuts for the middle class are all front loadedOne of the key provisions in the GOP tax bill to help middle class families is a new Family Flexibility Credit of $300 for each tax filer and another $300 for a spouse But that credit expires after five years making the math for the middle class A lot less rosy In 2023 the year the tax credit would go away the $59000 family would barely get any tax reduction at all and by 2024 therewould be an increase Kamin foundWhen The Washington Post asked Ryans office about this they deferred to the House Ways and Means Committee A spokeswoman there sent over the breakdown for how the $59000 family gets a tax cut in the first year but not what happens in the following yearsThere are trade-offs in any tax bill As the Ways and Means Committee worked late into the night to finalize its plan the members made a last-minute decision to help big businesses at the expense of the middle class by making a major change to theAccording to a person familiar with the negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly Republicans expect the tax break for the middle class will be extended although its not clear right now how that would happenIf Republicans help the middle class more they either have to scale back business tax cuts or add even more to the debt The package already adds $15 trillion to Americas debt over the next decade Adding any morewould run afoul of the process Republicans hope to use to get the bill through the Senate with a simple majority  something critical to its chances of passagebecause of broad Democratic oppositionKamins analysis is just for one family making $59000 a year Later today the Joint Committee on Taxation is expected to release a report detailing what happens to families across the income spectrum under this tax plan JCT is a nonpartisan group that is the official scorekeeper onhow much congressional tax bills cost and who wins and losesEarly estimates predict that a sizable number of middle class families will see a tax increase under this plan The New York Times that 13 million people makingless than $100000 would see a tax increase under the GOP bill based on an open-source model called  Ernie Tedeschi an economist who served in President Barack Obamas Treasury Department that 25 millionfamilies would facehigher taxes in 2018 under the plan and 47 million by 2027Another issue Kamin found is that the Family Flexibility Credit and the expanded Child Tax Credit ($1600 a year per child instead of $1000 per child now) are not indexed to inflation meaning the amount of the deduction does not go up over time even as the things families would want to buy with that credit do These credits are supposed to replace the current personal exemption which is indexed to inflationAlmost every bill gets changed between the time it is introduced and the final vote Since middle-class tax relief is a core promise of Trumps Republicans are likely to revisit this if the JCT official assessment shows a higher number of families would be worse off under the billWe also have another bright line test as we need to deliver middle class middle income hard-working families  we need to deliver them a tax cut Those are the two areas where the president wont budge Everything else were pretty flexible on Gary Cohn Trumps top economic adviser  Fox Business on FridayThe Senate is also still crafting its own version of the tax planSen Patrick J Toomey (R-Pa) a member of the Senate Finance Committee said Friday that if he had his way the family credits would all be permanentWere going to have to make some tough decisions about what can be permanent and what has to expire Toomey saidIn April 2016 Japans coast guard seized a  some 170 miles east of Okinotori revealing a long-ignored fact Japan has been engaging in  to expand its territorial claims since 1987Okinotori is a tiny outcrop about the size of a small bedroom Much of the islet lies below sea level even at low tide  and its about 950 nautical miles south of Tokyo and 850 nautical miles east of Taipei So why has the Japanese government reportedly poured $600 million over the past three decades to cultivate coral erect steel breakwaters and build concrete walls on Okinotori or remote bird island in the Philippine SeaWith global sea levels rising this might seem a  But Japan is eyeing the rich fisheries and mineral deposits around the islet resources that could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars And theres a larger   Okinotori is situated between the  a position that can deny the Chinese navy access into the Pacific The islet is also close to sea lanes transporting materials that are vital to Japans economyExploring these strategic assets depends on one important condition whether Okinotori is a rock or an island Under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea () a coastal state can establish an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured UNCLOS Article 76 also stipulates that a coastal states continental shelf can extend beyond its territorial sea to the outer edge of the continental margin Thus a coastal state potentially can claim a large mass of water as its EEZ along with the sovereign rights to exploit conserve and manage the natural resources within the EEZ So Japan has intended to establish an EEZ around Okinotori  Relevant to the issue is the definition of island and rock UNCLOS stipulates that an island is a naturally formed area of land surrounded by water which is above water at high tide [Article 121 (1)] The law does not clearly define what a rock is specifying only that [r]ocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf [Article 121 (3)]So UNCLOS has a big loophole Japan claims Okinotori is an island based on Article 121 (1) but also maintains that Article 121 (3) is about rocks and thus is irrelevant because there is no clear definition of rock This created a useful excuse for Japan and other countries (including China in the South China Sea) for their island-building projectsOne point is clear though An island can be the base point of establishing an EEZ but a rock cannot Despite the fact that  of international law citing Article 60 (8) have long argued that artificially built islands do not generate an EEZ the Japanese government has been engaged in island-building on Okinotori for decadesBoth  and  disputed the island claim when Japan filed its 2008 claim for an EEZ around the uninhabitable islet to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (UNCLCS) The  declined its ruling on the Japanese claim because ofthe dispute Thus the EEZ around Okinotori is a unilateral declaration by the Japanese government and is not recognized by the UNCLCSTaiwan has not challenged Japans self-claimed EEZ despite the fact that the waters surrounding the islet have traditionally been Taiwanese fishing grounds Taipeis ambiguous position is mainly because both Taiwan and Japan face a common security threat from China The recent territorial dispute over the sovereignty of  further aggravated the antagonism between China and Japan  already strained by the historical legacy of Japans invasion during World War IIMeanwhile Taipei has been fending off Beijings  to Taiwans sovereignty for more than 60 years Treating the island country as a renegade province that needs to  Chinese leaders have vigorously isolated the Taipei government in the international community and threatened Taiwan with military force Because China has been conducting underwater surveys around Okinotori in the event of military conflicts in the Taiwan Strait  have long suggested that Taipei support Japans claim so that it can block Beijings activities  The Japanese government has detained a number of Taiwanese fishing vessels since 2005 in the waters surrounding the islet  each time with a fine of roughly $40000 to $50000 With Korean or Chinese fishing vessels operating in the same area largely left alone these seizures gave the impression that Japan treats Taiwan as an easy targetAfter the most recent incident Taiwans parliament adopted a  denouncing the Japanese government Taiwans outgoing president Ma Ying-jeou also dispatched patrol boats followed by a Lafayette-class frigate to the waters near Okinotori to protect Taiwanese fishing operations in the area The Japanese government lodged a protest and deployed patrol boats to the areaCool heads may eventually prevail the common security interests between Japan and Taiwan are too grave to be ignored In early May Tokyo sent a   the younger brother of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe  to meet Ma and President-elect Tsai Ing-wen in Taipei Ma and Tsai expressed their willingness to resolve the dispute peacefullyWhat are the wider ramifications here First of all Japan and other countries have criticized Chinas frantic  in the South China Sea including piling sand onto reefs to create islands constructing military installations and airstrips on these man-made islands and  to accept the international arbitration of territorial disputes initiated by the While Tokyos island-building activities on Okinotori are not as extensive as Beijings efforts the unilateral declaration of a Japanese EEZ to circumvent international law and arbitrary detention of Taiwanese fishing vessels around the islet are problematic Beijing is likely to exploit the obvious double standard in Tokyos position on Okinotori to defend its own activities in the South China Sea  Secondly the broader interests of the international community and the countries with disputed claims suggests that theres a need for a more practical approach using bilateral or multilateral agreements After all Tokyo and Taipei agreed in 2013 to a  to let both sides operate in waters near the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands that are currently claimed by both countries (as well as China) This agreement could serve as an example for both Taipei and Tokyo in resolving the current dispute  and for

killerAt around 430 Wednesday the Facebook page no longer only displayed his nameIt now reads Remembering Darren DrakeIn a case with a thousand plot twists there has been but one constant in the murder investigation of Kim Jong Nam Nothing is ever what it seemsThe victim himself  the playboy half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un  was traveling under false papers when he died and had to be identified using DNA The two women accused of killing him turned out to be hired dupes paid a few dollars to perform what they thought was a reality-TV stunt Stranger still was the murder weapon liquid VX a toxin so powerful that a few drops rubbed onto the skin killed the victim in minutes yet it failed to harm the two women who applied the poison with their bare hands Even more mysterious why North Korea would go to extravagant lengths to use a battlefield-grade chemical weapon on foreign soil only to work equally hard to cover its tracksFor the prosecutors preparing for the first court hearings later this month some of the mysteries behind Kim Jong Nams death inside a Malaysian airport terminal will likely never be resolved But nearly five months after the killing US and Asian officials have a clearer view of the attacks significance In carrying out historys first state-sponsored VX assassination in a country 3000 miles from its borders North Korea has demonstrated a new willingness to use its formidable arsenal of deadly toxins and poisons to kill or intimidate enemies on foreign soil analysts saySeen in the light of North Koreas recent flurry of provocative missiles tests Kim Jong Nams killing now looks to many experts like a proving exercise for a weapons system  in this case a robust chemical-weapons stockpile that Pyongyang is thought to have built over decades and kept carefully under wrapsThe choice of weapons was not accidental said Sue Mi Terry a former senior analyst on North Korea at the CIA and currently managing director for Korea at the Bower Group Asia Everything about this incident was intended to send a messageUS and South Korean intelligence agencies have long believed that North Korea possesses significant stores of the nerve agents VX and sarin  and probably biological weapons as well  but in the past such arsenals were assumed to be intended as a deterrent against foreign attacks But in the attack on Kim Jong Nam North Korea revealed a strategy for using chemicals that looks a lot like cyberwarfare limited highly secretive attacks that can damage an enemy without inviting massive retaliation  Whether Kim Jong Un would risk such an attack against a foreign government  even the United States  is unclear But the February incident is a reminder that North Korea has options for striking targets abroad that do not hinge on the countrys ability to build an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the US mainland current and former US officials sayNorth Korea is bad enough when youre talking about their nuclear and missiles program Rebecca Hersman a former Defense Department deputy assistant secretary for countering weapons of mass destruction said at a recent policy forum But I think we ignore their chemical and biological programs truly at our own perilKim Jong Nam probably knew an attack was coming though he might not have imagined where or howThe 45-year-old eldest son of dead North Korean leader Kim Jong Il had been living in exile in the Chinese province of Macau since 2003 and he had become a vocal critic of North Koreas repressive communist government He became a probable candidate for assassination after his younger half brother took control of the country in late 2011 claiming the job that had once been promised to him His fate was likely sealed in 2013 when the newly installed leader ordered the execution of Jang Song Thaek a prominent North Korean defense official and Kim Jong Nams uncle and longtime protectorBut when he strode into Kuala Lumpurs KLIA2 airport with his light jacket and backpack on Feb13 he walked unknowingly into an exquisitely laid trapNot one but two teams of assassins had rehearsed for the moment The only ones Kim Jong Nam would see were female two attractive women in their 20s who had been recruited locally One of them identified by police as Indonesian native Siti Aisyah worked in a Kuala Lumpur massage parlor the other Doan Thi Huong had moved from Vietnam to Malaysia to work in what authorities described vaguely as the entertainment industryBoth would tell police that they were hired by a Korean man to perform pranks such as smearing baby oil on strangers for a hidden-camera video show For their service each was promised $90 in cash and a shot at future TV stardom  But on Feb 13 the surprise prepared for Kim Jong Nam was VX not baby oil In a sequence that would be captured on security-camera video and later broadcast around the world Kim Jong Nam was accosted as he checked in for a flight in the airports departure lounge A woman in a white sweatshirt is seen grabbing the North Koreans face from behind Although the images are unclear police think the second woman helped smear the oily liquid over the victims cheeksAt least four men  later identified by Malaysian officials as North Korean agents  are seen watching the attack and shadowing the visibly agitated Kim Jong Nam as he seeks help from police and an airport first-aid station Minutes later as the dying Kim is wheeled into an ambulance the men slip through the departures gate to board flights out of the countryThe only ones who didnt escape were the women and the victim himself Aisyah and Huong mysteriously avoided serious injury  perhaps weapons experts speculate because each handled harmless precursor chemicals that became toxic only when mixed or perhaps because both women quickly washed their hands after the attack Both are seen quickly entering airport lavatories after the attack behavior that prosecutors have cited in accusing the two women of being knowingly complicit in Kim Jong Nams murder The two women face court appearances later this month on charges of first-degree murder a capital crime in Malaysia Kim Jong Nam who quickly sought medical help after the attack lost consciousness in the airport medical station and died in the ambulance less than 20 minutes after the episode began It would take two autopsies and nearly two weeks to determine the name of the rare toxin that took his life Malaysian investigators would conclude that the VX was smuggled into the country by North Korea most likely in a commercial jetliner Its unclear whether the toxin arrived ready to use or in a form that required mixing two harmless ingredients to create In either case the advantage for the assassins is that only a few drops are needed to kill said a US official with years of experience in chemical-weapons defenseWas it assembled in Malaysia Not necessarily said the official who insisted on anonymity in discussing US intelligence assessments of the North Korean threat A single three-ounce container that would fit in your carry-on luggage would hold far more than youd ever needUntil the Feb 13 attack hard evidence of Pyongyangs arsenal of toxins did not exist at least in the public realm But for at least two decades US intelligence assessments have concluded that North Korea possesses a sizable stockpile of chemical weapons with VX being one of many varietiesA State Department report in 2001 found that North Korea was already self-sufficient in making all the necessary precursors for sarin and VX as well as older weapons such as mustard gas Drawing from an array of sources  from North Korean defectors and spies to satellite photos and electronic eavesdropping  US agencies calculated the size of the countrys chemical stockpile at between 2500 and 5000 tons Thats far larger than Syrias arsenal at its peak and larger than any known to exist in the world except for those built by the Soviet and US militaries during the Cold WarA parallel but reportedly much smaller program produces biological weapons current and former US intelligence officials think Published Defense Intelligence Agency documents have described efforts underway to weaponize at least four pathogens anthrax plague cholera and biological toxins such as botulinum Work on chemical and biological programs began years before Pyongyang tested its first nuclear bomb and US analysts suspect that both were intended at first as a deterrent against foreign attacks But although North Korea regularly boasts of its achievements in atomic energy and missiles its chemical and biological weapons have always been kept carefully hidden according to a study released jointly last month by the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and the US Korea InstituteNorth Korea has deliberately built its NBC [nuclear biological chemical] infrastructures in extreme secrecy undertaken camouflage concealment and deception operations  and dispersed NBC facilities around the country report author Joseph S Bermudez Jr a prominent expert on North Korean weapons systems wrote in the report It is therefore probable that there are significant elements of the NBC programs and their infrastructures that are simply unknown outside the North Korean government  US and South Korean defense officials alike take the threat seriously so much so that both governments inoculate their troops against exposure to anthrax bacteria and even the smallpox virus Soldiers deployed along the border are issued gas masks and protective suits and put through occasional drills to prepare for the day when canisters of VX or sarin are fired across the border in North Korean rockets or artillery shellsAny such attack would certainly prompt a massive retaliation But Kim Jong Nams assassination has forced US officials to consider the possibility of a clandestine attack one that might be more difficult to trace or to defend againstWith biological weapons especially theres an opportunity for covert attack with deniability since attribution would be difficult said Andrew C Weber former assistant secretary of defense for nuclear chemical and biological weapons defense Although US officials are fixated on North Koreas nuclear advances a nuclear attack is not the most likely or possibly even the most consequential he saidAs Kim Jong Nams assassination demonstrated the delivery of such weapons can be easy  especially for deadly pathogens but also for toxic chemicals he said And any military response would be delayed for days or weeks while investigators attempted to find evidence that firmly pointed to a perpetrator A chemical attack would be knowable almost as soon as it happens Weber said But Kim Jong Un is a brutal guy and he may have no qualms against doing it Or he may just miscalculateKim Jong Uns plan to use VX to kill his half brother included extensive measures to ensure secrecy  so many in fact that some experts think the North Koreans wanted to keep their enemies ignorant about its use of the toxin or at least unsureAfter Kim Jong Nams death Pyongyang requested the immediate return of his body without an autopsy being performed Malaysia refused and soon afterward local news media reported an attempt by unknown individuals to break into the morgue where the body was kept The attempt failed but in the weeks since North Korea has insisted that the leaders half brother died of a heart attack and that any reports of chemical toxins were lies spread by outsiders  Some longtime North Korea analysts are convinced that the killing was intended mostly as a warning to other members of the Kim family who might be plotting Kim Jong Uns overthrow The leader has a history of extreme brutality toward relatives whom he suspects of plotting against him He may have seen Kim Jong Nam  a free-spoken man of leisure who enjoyed protected status in China and was widely reported to have intelligence contacts with several foreign governments  as a possible future choice by Beijing to replace himIt might have just been an expression of how much he hates traitors said Joshua Pollack a former government consultant on North Korean weapons programs and now editor of the journal Nonproliferation Review Theres no doubt that VX was an unusual choice for an assassination But I think it was probably chosen because they thought no one would look for itOther current and former US officials say that North Korea would have calculated that the VX would be found eventually According to these officials Kim Jong Uns plan was to showcase his ability to strike with terrifying weapons while also concealing the evidence to reduce the chances of retaliationHis message about VX was We have it said Terry the former CIA analyst He knew they would eventually find itWhatever the motivation the tactic worked on nearly every level North Korea experts say A potential rival was eliminated A capability to strike covertly using one of the most fearsome chemical weapons ever designed was amply demonstrated And North Korea while issuing denials that are widely seen as implausible managed to get away with it at least until nowThey carry out an attack and make people afraid but then ensure that theres no evidence that can lead to real accountability Pollack said For them thats the sweet spotTOKYO  Americans may now be banned from going to North Korea as tourists but thanks to the power of the Internet you can now see what its like to fly over Aram Pan a Singaporean photographer who has publishedto North Korea flew over Pyongyang in a microlight plane last month filming video and taking photos the whole wayThey take off from the Mirim Air Club on the outskirts of the capital an airstrip built under North Korean leader Kim Jong Un who is a keen pilot and often flies himself around the country Lots of other light aircraft can be seen alongside the runwayThe video offers amazing views over the capital home to the 2 million North Koreans most loyal to the regime which is infamous for keeping the country isolatedTheres a birds-eye view of the central monuments of Kim Il Sung Square and the Juche Tower the  of the Mirae Scientists District and Ryomong Street two of Kim Jong Uns landmark development projects Thats without even mentioning the sparkling blue of the  or the shining silver roof of theMay Day stadiumIts a bright sunny day and the sun glistens off the Taedong River that bisects the capital The fields look green and lushPyongyang looks like a modern and thriving city  which is exactly what the North Korean regime wants people to think it isThe Kim regime is notoriously restrictive in what it allows outsiders to see Visitors to Pyongyang are always accompanied by government minders and are restricted in their movements around the city They dont pass sensitive sites such as the leaders residence or security offices often taking the same routes through the city no matter what direction theyre goingFor that reason the footage is extraordinary because it offers unfettered views of the city although North Korean officials did delete some of the photos and footage  a specialist website devoted to North Korea that published the video on its YouTube channelHe didnt say what footage was deleted just that he was allowed to keep about 90 percent of what he shot The deleted footage was probably of sensitive places such as military installations or anything related to the leaderPan who has been to North Korea at least 15 times has previously shot video from inside a light plane But this was the first time the North Korean authorities allowed him to attach a 360-degree camera to the bottom of an aircraftNorth Korea which has been promoting tourism last year started offering microlight flights over Pyongyang but did not allow any photography from the air Pan said he was told it was a safety issue  the winds are strong and a phone or camera could be knocked out of the holders hand But after appeals through the countrys tourism agencies Pan was allowed to take up equipment that could be tetheredHe went up during September a time of year when the capital looks its best The North Korean authorities prefer to allow outsiders in over the summer when the air is clear and the city seems most verdant Visiting in winter months gives a very different impression Gray skies and smoke from power plants make the whole city look dullSome critics of Pans project have said he is helping the regime with its propaganda showing only the best parts of a police state that commits widespread human rights abuses Conversely Pan says that some people laud his project because they deem it to be anti-capitalistThe last thing I want is for this project to become a tool for either side to use as ammunition against each other Pan writes on his website saying that he is simply publishing what he sees on his own journey of discoveryAsked if he felt he was presented with an idealized view of North Korea Pan said he didnt think soLet me give you just one example he told NK News Ive been visiting their trade fairs regularly and with each visit I see consumerism on the rise Advertising is also being more widely implemented but for now its still within the shopsRegardless of the constraints the footage will be welcomed by analysts who usually pore over satellite imagery and Google Earth The resolution of those images is often not great and images are not always timely Given how little information there is about North Korea every little bit helpsIn Mondays early hours Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Bahrain and Egypt released coordinated statements with the tiny-yet-wealthy peninsular nation of Qatar They cut air sea and land links and ordered Qatari officialsand nationalsstationed in their countries to return homeQatar with just over300000 citizens has played an outsize role on the world stagebecause of its great wealth of oil and natural gasGlobal oil pricesMonday as both sides  Already  panic over a Saudi blockade of Qatars only land border prompted spooked residents to clean out supermarket shelves in DohaThe move is with the Qataris who the Saudis and Emiratisclaim are supporting terrorist groups as well as being far too cordial with Iran their regional archrival Acomplicated and uncertain state of affairs is playing out with far-reaching stakes  Qatar after all is home to a crucial forward base for the US Central Command Heres our attempt at a quick primer onwhat you need to knowFor years now officials in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have been angry over what they perceive to be  Unlikeneighboring Bahrain for example which largely toes the Saudi line Qatar has diverged from other members in the Gulf Cooperation Council a bloc of six Arab monarchies and used its vast coffersto project its own influence far and wideAfter the political upheavals of the Arab Spring for instance Qatar aligned itself with Islamist political parties such as Egypts Muslim Brotherhood believing it right to  Much to  Qatars state-funded news network Al Jazeera also seemed to take up the cause of these groups often championing democracy and dissent in a region ruled by secular autocrats or unaccountable royals And Qatar was among the most active backers ofIslamist fighters in rebellions in Syria and LibyaNow Qatars critics say it has failed to rein in its support for certain Islamist militantgroups  including Hamas and the main al-Qaeda-linked organization in Syria The Qataris were also accused of backing Yemens Houthi rebels a startling claim given that Qatar until the day before was part of the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis who are loosely backed by IranThe countries of the region can be divided into two camps one that seeks to advance its foreign interests through support of Islamists and one whose foreign policy is guided by opposition to the rise of Islamists  Qatar in Hassans scheme falls into the former camp while the Saudis and Emiratis are in the latterQatars Foreign Ministry called the measures unjustified in a statement and said the decision to sever ties was a violation of the countrys sovereignty and based on claims and allegations that have no basis in factSaudi Arabia and to a lesser extent the UAE also support various rebel groups and Islamist factions in Middle East conflicts But the two countries have stood against political Islam in placeslike Egypt championing President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi who came to power in a 2013 coup that ousted the ruling Muslim Brotherhood and was followed up by a vicious bloody crackdown on Islamists The embattledYemeni government which is almost wholly propped up by Riyadh the  and the Indian Ocean archipelago of the Maldives  whose president   all joined the break in relations with QatarThe UAE in particular has bridled at Qatars continued role in backing Islamists in Libya and elsewhere and appears to have led the charge in pushing for Qatari isolationThere are a number of theories for whythings have drifted toward such an extreme Two separate possible hacking incidents have framed the escalating feud First a statement was posted on an official Qatari site that attributed comments to the emir that were sympathetic to Iran and Shiite militant group Hezbollah Even after the Qatarisrejected the report and said it was the creation of hackers Saudi and Emirati outlets continued to spread it as fact Meanwhile seem to showhis countrys long-running desire to counter Qatari influenceSome experts believe that Mohammed bin Zayed the influential crown prince of the emirate of Abu Dhabi has found  in the youthful Saudi deputy crown prince Mohammad bin Salman who has presided over Saudi Arabiasmarked foreign policy assertiveness in recent years and pushed for a regional anti-Iran allianceIn  Qatari officials apparently paid close to $1 billion in ransom for the release of a Qatari falconry party abducted while hunting in southern Iraq The bulk of the funds allegedly made their way to Iranian officials and affiliated Shiite militias  payments that were the straw that broke the camels back for Qatars critics in the Gulf according to a source quoted by the British newspaperBut a leading driver also has to be President Trump whose friendly visit to Riyadh last month and  seems to have emboldened officials there On Tuesday Trump came out loudly against Qatar on Twitter linking it to the funding of radical ideologyDuring my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology Leaders pointed to Qatar - look Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) The Saudis and Emiratis said Andrew Bowen a visiting fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute saw thisas a key moment after Trumps visit to bring Qatar to heel According to  officials in Abu Dhabi want toextract huge concessions from Doha including

United Statescould do so as well though the Trump administration made little meaningful comment about the impasse on Monday It may have to though given that  is a pivotal staging ground for US counterterrorism operationsThenwith his series of tweets pointing the finger at Qatar Trump seemed to go against the instincts of the American foreign policy establishment including the calming statements of the US envoy in Doha and escalated the situationQatar has significant fiscal reserves retains the political support of the Turkish government and is a key energy partner for countries likeRussia and China The Saudis and Emiratis may realize that isolating Qatar is no easy featThey think they can strangle Qatar and get it to capitulate said Theodore Karasik a senior analyst at Gulf State Analytics to  This could backfire on them completely The number one problem is that it will force Qatar to seek new security partnerships with Turkey Doha can also turn to IranI do worry that theyre going to misjudge each others positions which could lead to this conflict taking a little bit longer to play out Bowen told Todays WorldViewThe spat also dramatizes the complexity of the divisions in the Middle East which commentators in the United States often try to reduce to a simple binary between a Sunni Arab-bloc led by Saudi Arabia and Shiite IranThe tension between Qatar and its neighbors shows that the old geopolitical lines can no longer explain the Middle East Trump who  seems to be taking a very curious stance by aligning wholesale with Riyadh and Abu Dhabi After all

professional trajectory of Harvey Weinstein the famed and feared Hollywood mogul has beenas volatile as his personalityOne of Hollywoods most powerful producers Weinstein co-founded Miramax Filmsturningthe studiointo a behemoth that changed the way independent films were viewedHisname has been attached to some of the most famous movies from the past few decades and he has remained a force in a film industry that has changed substantially since he began his career in the 1970sAlong the way he helped propel the careers of people such as Quentin Tarantino andSteven Soderbergh and won the admiration ofcountless critics and othersBut his reputation for abrasiveness and his legendary temper have earned him more than a few enemies along the way making Weinstein the frequent target of award-ceremony jokes and pointed anecdotesMatt Damon once compared him to a scorpion There hasbeen bad blood too with a Kevin Smith  The complicated relationship Weinsteinhas with the industrywas perhaps best summed up by a speech Meryl Streep gave at the Golden Globes one yearI want to thank God  Harvey Weinstein she joked The punisher Old Testament I guessBut a blockbuster story last week represented the most severe blowto his careerThe story aireddecades of previously unknown sexual harassment accusations against Weinstein who said he planned to take a leave of absenceThen on Sunday night the Weinstein Co board of directors announced thatfrom the company he co-foundedFour directors  including Weinsteins brother Bob  said they were firing the high-profile high-powered mogulin light of new information about misconductThe firing was effective immediately bringing the latest chapter in Weinsteins up-and-down career to an ignominious endIn 1979 Bob and Harvey Weinstein co-founded Miramax which would help bring art-house cinema into the mainstreamThe studio broke throughin the late 1980s with a trio of hitsSoderberghs Sex Lies and VideotapeJim Sheridans My Left Foot which won Daniel Day-Lewis an Oscar and Giuseppe Tornatores Cinema Paradiso which won the Oscar for best foreign-language filmDisney bought the studio in 1993 for between $60 million and $80 million giving it an infusion of cash and the backing of a major company Miramax continued its success financing Tarantinos 1994 hit  which went on to be one of the most influential films of the decade The film which was made for $85 million grossed more than $200 million worldwideFor an 11-year period from 1992 to 2003 Miramax Filmshad at least one its films nominated for an Oscar each year winning best picture for several of them includingThe English Patient (1996) Shakespeare in Love (1998) and Chicago (2002)Other acclaimedfilms that came out of Miramax included Good Will Hunting (1997) and The Cider House Rules (1999)And hits such as Scream (1996) and Jackie Brown (1997) kept the money flowingMiramax was known for pursing Oscars with a drive and a budget previously unknown in the industry placing more advertisements lobbying more voters dismissing more rivals and sending out more freebies than other studios in 2008But the Weinstein brothers became known fora ruthless way of doing businessMiramax ran on fear Theyre intimidating they shout a lot they foam at the mouthStuart Burkin who started at the company in 1991 Even as he was dominating Hollywood according the Times Harvey Weinstein was accused of serial sexual harassmentThe actress Ashley Judd said that while she was shooting the 1997 film Kiss the Girls he lured her to his hotel room for a meeting trying to force her to give him a massage or watch him showerHow do I get out of the room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein she recalled in an interview with the TimesThroughout the 1990s the Times reported he settled with numerous women including a young assistant in New York in 1990 actress Rose McGowan in 1997 and an assistant in London in 1998Things took a downturn professionally for Weinstein in the 2000sDisneyparted ways with the Weinsteins in 2005 after arguments overthe studios ballooning movie budgets and disagreements over the degree of their autonomyHarveyand Bob started a new independent studio the Weinstein Co that same yearBut Harvey Weinstein seemed to have lost some of his touch Between 2005 and 2009 the Weinstein Co released some 70 films many of which nobody wanted to watchFlops included the 2005 film Derailedfeaturing actorsClive OwenandJennifer Aniston which critics derided as  and  According to a 2009of the brothers more than a quarter of the films in that four-year stretch fell short of the $1 million box-office mark in the United States of those 13 took in less than $100000I think I took my eye off the ball Harvey Weinstein  in 2011 From about 2005 2006 2007 I was out of it I thought I could oversee movies and have it done for me so to speakDuring that period Weinstein also branched out into other fields buying part of the Halston fashion brand part of the cable network Ovation and the social networking site A Small WorldWhen I first got there in 2008 the focus was not on movies David Glasser the president of the Weinstein Co told Vanity Fair Harvey was focused on Internet and fashion and the global media pictureComplicating matters NBC Universal  the Weinstein Co in 2008 for making a deal to move the reality show Project Runway from Bravo to Lifetime The Weinstein Co later  with NBC Universal for an undisclosed amountThe year 2011 marked Harvey Weinsteins professional resurgence The Kings Speech starring Colin Firth was nominated for 12 Oscars taking home the best-picture trophyCritics piled on praise calling Weinstein the Look there are four five businesses we never should have been in and we ended up humbled and learned from that experience hein 2011 We are concentrating on movies pulling the band back together and I think the coming year could be as good or better than any we ever had at MiramaxThe next year Weinstein cleaned up at the Golden Globes for The Iron Lady My Week with Marilyn and The Artist which would win best picture at the OscarsStreep paid him homage during that Globes ceremony with her God quote As Gawker put it Weinstein had risen from the grave to feast on the bones of his enemiesThat year he was  one of Time magazines 100 most influential people in the worldInabout sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein the Times reported that he had reached at least eight settlements with women over the yearsIn  Weinstein said I appreciate the way Ive behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain and I sincerely apologize for it Though Im trying to do better I know I have a long way to go That is my commitment My journey now will be to learn about myself and conquer my demonsAs The Washington Posts Stephanie Merry put it Weinsteins statement was a mix of remorse rap lyrics and an attempt to distract from his indiscretions by bringing up his fury at the NRA Most importantly it doesnt contradict the allegationsOne of his attorneys Charles Harder told the  that Weinstein plans to sue the newspaper charging that the story relies on mostly hearsay accounts and a faulty report  Another lawyer who is advising Weinstein said in a statement that he denies many of the accusations as patently false according to the TimesTwo days later that lawyerLisa Bloom saidshe was as Weinsteins adviserBy that point Weinstein was on an indefinite leave of absence fromthe Weinstein Co while an internal investigation was conducted on the allegations the board saidAs Harvey has said it is important for him to get professional help for the problems he has acknowledged the board said in a statement Next steps will depend on Harveys therapeutic progress the outcome of the Boards independent investigation and Harveys own personal decisionsBy Sunday night he was goneThe directors of TheCompany  Robert Lance Maerov Richard Koenigsberg and Tarak Ben Ammar  have determined and have informed Harvey that his employment with TheCompany is effective immediately the board saidFour months before its July4 missile test North Korea offered the world a rare technical preview of its latest missile engine one said to be capable of lobbing nuclear warheads at US cities A video on state-run TV depicted a machine with thickets of tubes and vents and a shape that struck some US experts as familiar  in a distinctly Soviet wayIt shocked me said Michael Elleman one weapons expert who noticed jarring similarities between the engine tested by North Korea in March and one he frequently encountered in Russia at the end of the Cold War It seemed to come out of nowhereAfter intensive study Elleman a former consultant at the Pentagon and other specialists would report that they had detected multiple design features in the new North Korean missile engine that echo those of a 1960s-era Soviet workhorse called the RD-250There is no record of Pyongyangs obtaining blueprints for the Russian missile engine and experts disagree on whether it ever did so But the discovery of similarities has focused new attention on a question that has dogged US analysts for at least the past two years How has North Korea managed to make surprisingly rapid gains in its missile program despite economic sanctions and a near-universal ban on exports of military technology to the impoverished communist state  Many weapons experts say North Koreas startling display of missile prowess is a reflection of the countrys growing mastery of weapons technology as well as its leaders fierce determination to take the country into the nuclear club But others see continuing evidence of an outsize role by foreigners including Russian scientists who provided designs and know-how years ago and the Chinese vendors who supply the electronics needed for modern missile-guidance systemsWhether outsiders played a decisive role in Tuesdays firing of an intercontinental ballistic missile is not publicly known But the evidence from the televised engine test in March is tantalizing and also disturbing analysts say While North Korea is known to have obtained other Soviet missile designs in the past the new revelations suggest the possibility of a transfer of weapons secrets that has gone undetected until nowIt would mean that North Korea had a wider procurement network in the former Soviet Union than we had thought said Elleman a missile expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies who oversaw the dismantling of Soviet-era missiles in Russia and Ukraine two decades ago My first question would be What else have they gotIt was without a doubt one of the strangest mass arrests in the history of Moscows Sheremetyevo-2 Airport On Oct15 1992 police detained 60 Russian missile scientists along with their families as they prepared to board a plane for North KoreaUnder questioning the scientists confessed that they had been hired as a group to help the North Koreans build a modern missile fleet In those early days after the collapse of the Soviet Union there was little work for Russias elite weapons scientists and little pay to help them feed and clothe their familiesWe wanted to make money and come back one of the scientists explained at the time to a Russian journalistScores of other scientists did make the journey in the 1990s taking with them decades of experience as well as parts and blueprints It was the beginning of a Russian-influenced renaissance in North Koreas missile arsenal which until then consisted mostly of outdated early-generation Scuds some of them purchased on the black market About the same time North Korea also obtained sensitive nuclear technology from Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer KhanThe Russian government has insisted it had nothing to do with the transfer of missile secrets to North Korea But Soviet designs became the templates for a series of intermediate-range ballistic missiles built and tested by North Korea over the next two decades with extra features and capabilities added by a new generation of engineers recruited from the countrys best schoolsStill the program struggled with many missiles blowing up on the launchpad said Gaurav Kampani a University of Tulsa international security expert and fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic CouncilNorth Koreas ballistic missiles especially its long-range missile project were often considered a joke because of an unusual number of test failures Kampani saidThe jokes all but stopped after North Korea achieved a series of technical breakthroughs in surprisingly rapid succession Just in the past four years Pyongyang has launched satellites into orbit and successfully tested one missile that can be fired from a submarine as well as another that uses solid fuel a significant military advance because it allows for more mobility and a much faster launchOn Tuesday its Hwasong-14 missile became the first in North Korean history capable of traveling more than 3400 miles the minimum distance needed to be classified as an intercontinental ballistic missileThe missile is believed to be a two-stage version of the Hwasong-12 which carries the same engine North Korea put on public display in March  In nearly every case the technical foundations of the new missiles can be traced to know-how acquired from Russians and others over many years Yet the advances of the past years suggest that North Koreas engineers are now managing quite well on their ownThe consensus has been that North Koreas program  missile as well as nuclear  is mostly indigenous said Laura Holgate a top adviser on nonproliferation to the Obama administration who stepped down in January as head of the US mission to the United Nations in Vienna They continue to seek to import commercial dual-use technologies for their weapons programs but the design and innovation is homegrownThe many failures in the past were simply part of the learning curve for a country with a demonstrated ability to benefit from its mistakes said David Albright a former UN weapons inspector and president of the Institute for Science and International Security a Washington think tankArmed with the acquisition of many goods from abroad North Korea appears to have devoted considerable resources to making the missiles domestically and more importantly figuring out how to launch them successfully Albright said With regards to missiles practice makes perfectYet it is also clear that North Koreas engineers are continuing to benefit from designs bequeathed to them years ago Before Pyongyangs new missile engine surfaced US officials fretted about the Hwasong-10 a mobile intermediate-range ballistic missile that was successfully tested last June The missile which is capable of reaching targets as far as Guam 2000 miles away has been shown in independent analyses to be a modified version of a Russian missile commonly known as the R-27 Zyb North Korea is believed to have obtained the Russian blueprint in the 1990s and to have spent years working on prototypes current and former US officials saidElleman the former Pentagon missile expert believes that North Koreas newest missile engine has a similar past The designs were most likely obtained years ago through rogue scientists or on the black market only to surface recently as part of a newly energized missile programElleman is preparing to publish an analysis comparing the engine used in the Hwasong-12 and Hwasong-14 with the Soviet-era RD-250 using photos that highlight nearly identical features including cooling tubes exhaust nozzles and the four auxiliary engines that steer the rocketTheyve had these designs for a long time and theyve probably been doing exercises around these engines for 15 years he said All that work was done and all [that] was left to do was the ground testing and flight testing with these different designs It is what has allowed them to rapidly build up and try all these things over the past few years  The key new element was most likely North Korean leader Kim Jong Un himself who accelerated the pace of the countrys nuclear and missile development soon after taking power They are serious about trying to create a capability that could threaten the United States Elleman saidThe lingering Soviet legacy partly explains why North Korean technology tends to be decades behind that of the United States and other modern military powers said David S Cohen a former deputy director of the CIA who had advised the Obama administration on North Koreas weapons advancesThe missiles theyre shooting now have some new engineering but its all based on old Soviet models Cohen saidUnable to purchase advanced technology on the open market North Korea also remains dependent on smugglers and black-marketeers to obtain some of the parts it needs particularly electronics Cohen saidBut he cautioned against underestimating a North Korean leadership that repeatedly displayed ingenuity in working with old designs and systems as well as a determination to succeed in the face of international isolation and censureIt is a mistake to think that this is really a hermit kingdom that is cut off and doesnt have access to the Internet Cohen said They have a lot of disadvantages but the biggest part of the government economy is their nuclear and missiles program so the smartest folks they have are directed to do this workMy fear he added  is that people underestimate themMigrating birds dont pay much attention to border regulations it turns out But last years bird flu outbreak a huge blow to parts of the US poultry industry offers a clear example of why humans should take a closer look at the value of global trade agreementsIn 2015 the United States was battling its worst-ever outbreak of avian influenza While the Centers for Disease Control reported  the Department of Agriculturefor taxpayers at $950 million for cleanup and payments to more than 200 affected commercial poultry farmsThe outbreak required the slaughter of 50 million chickens and turkeys Annual US poultry exports fell by more than $15 billion after some trading partners banned all US poultry productsHeres how a global trade framework kept this situation from becoming far worse for the  Other major US partners trusted US regulators to stop the disease from entering their markets With US poultry products still welcome in many countries the prospects were not nearly as dim for US poultry farming operations and the thousands of jobs they provideYes the much-pilloried  (FTAs) of NAFTA and even the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) were an unlikely savior While the multilateral WTO agreement has provided the first step for encouraging countries to set trade policy based on sound scientific evidence these newer FTAs push partners to engage in additional regulatory cooperation with the United StatesYou cant stop bird flu  you can only hope to contain it Highly pathogenic avian influenza or HPAI  the particularly devastating 2015 variant of the disease  appears to have been transmitted from wild waterfowl to commercial poultryThe likely culprits were infected flocks of ducks or geese migrating home after spending the winter down south On the trek north the HPAI-infected flocks transmitted the disease to chickens and turkeys on farms in 15 states in the  in the first half of 2015Veterinarians from US government agencies including Department of the Interior and the USDA worked with farmers in  and other states to help contain the outbreak Upon positive results of HPAI they would cull infected flocks dispose of carcasses and then decontaminate and clean entire farms The last incident was reported in June 2015The USDA had to provide real-time public updates about what it was findingIn much the same way governments report human infectious disease outbreaks such as Ebola or Zika to the World Health Organization in Geneva governments must report the details of animal disease outbreaks to the  in Paris Better known by its French acronym the OIE serves three main global functions1) Convening veterinary and public health experts to establish disease standards based on scientific evidence2) Acting as a centralized clearinghouse to report and circulate information on animal disease outbreaks worldwide3) Establishing trade agreement guidelines  when to close and when to safely reopen markets  to guide commercial policy when a disease outbreak occursThe United States and other geographically large countries have pushed for an additional important protocol on regionalization If a country can make the scientific case that a particular disease outbreak has been contained to a geographic region and limited set of products then partners trade bans should not target unaffected products from other regions of the country  In a coincidence of timing the United States just recently won a major WTO  relying on these OIE guidelines India had failed to open its market to US poultry long before the 2015 HPAI outbreak As legal scholar  and I have  one major US concern in the WTO dispute was Indias failure to subscribe to the OIEs regionalization protocolUS commercial poultry farming falls into three main types chickens to lay eggs turkeys raised as meat and chickens raised as meatThe 2015 outbreak required the slaughter of poultry almost exclusively on farms that produced  and   reported that US egg and turkey production in 2015 declined by 4 percent and 2 percent respectivelyThe third type of US poultry farm  raising chickens for meat  lucked out thanks to regional  Georgia North Carolina and other top states for chicken meat production are in the Southeastern United States As these farms were outside the migratory path of the wildfowl that introduced the disease into the United States they avoided infection and thus did not have to cull their chickensAccording to the USDA US chicken meat production actually increased in 2015 This is important because chicken meat makes up roughly two-thirds of the value of total US poultry productionTrade bans related to disease can be particularly devastating for two reasons First trade in unaffected products can suffer  the recent avian flu ban might also have extended to US chicken meat farms for instanceSecond trade bans historically remain in place long after the disease has subsided Following the first known US cases of  (bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE) in December 2003 US beef was banned worldwide Exports bottomed out in 2004US exports to Canada and Mexico resumed as disease concerns subsided reaching pre-outbreak levels by 2006 Yet billions of dollars in potential US beef exports to other countries were lost Japan and South Korea took much longer to remove their bans and their beef trade with the United States did not reach pre-BSE levels for more than a decade  In 2015 the United States had FTAs with 20 countries  and these agreements significantly helped mitigate the impact of bird flu on US exports Like beef US poultry is a major export industry logging more than $5 billion in annual foreign sales Before the outbreak US poultry exports  including eggs turkey meat and chicken meat  were split fairly evenly between countries the United States has a free-trade agreement with and those it does not By and large trade with non-FTA partners is guided only by WTO rules like India many of those partners do not yet engage in as much regulatory cooperation with the United StatesOverall US poultry exports declined by more than $15 billion in the 12 months after the final bird flu case was reported in June 2015 The graph below shows how FTAs factored inFree trade agreements do more than just slash import tariffs As the bird flu example shows the introduction of deeper forms of regulatory policy cooperation between countries helps keep goods movingFor example the United States and Canada signed a 2013  on animal-disease zoning whereby each would explicitly accept the other countrys regulatory decisions on regionalization in the event of outbreaks During the 2015 bird flu episode  also adopted the US regulatory determinations that exports from certain US states were free of bird fluEven though Congress has yet to pass the TPP this new agreement has introduced new forms of  for agriculture beyond that found in the WTO The process of negotiating the agreement has also meant regulators in other TPP countries had been engaging with USDA counterparts and building trust before the 2015 outbreak  This engagement likely made regulators in  and  more willing than those in non-TPP countries to follow the regionalization protocol during the 2015 outbreakThe bird flu example shows how trade agreements can create important incentives for public health enforcement and disease containmentThe effectiveness of any public health response depends on stopping the disease outbreak early and upon discovery The worst case scenario involves a farmer hiding an outbreak from authorities and the disease spreading furtherThe safe and timely resumption of international trade after the quelling of an outbreak offers positive feedback to farmers Knowing that the market will be reopened  once the outbreak is contained  encourages the farmer to report and address an outbreak in the first placeThese lessons also apply to foreign farmers and help protect US consumers When foreign disease outbreaks occur a US policy that closes and reopens US markets based on scientific evidence helps reassure US consumers worried about the safety of their imports  and encourages transparency and reporting abroadCongressional Republicans plan to  of the nations tax code on Thursday a plan President Trump is billing as the biggest tax event in the history of our countryOn the eve of the plans scheduled release many of the major details were still being ironed out particularly the thorny questions of Republicans have said that among other things they want to simplify individual income tax brackets raise the standard deduction reduce corporate tax rates and eliminate some popular itemized deductions like the Even as details are being worked out its worth taking a look at how federal taxes work in this country Weve compiled charts below explaining the basics of the US tax system  who pays what and how thats changed over timeWere all familiar with the  The IRS levies a tax rate of 10 percent on your first $9525 of income 15 percent on$9525 to $38700 25 percent on $37950 to $93700 and so onBut in the tax code various credits and deductions for everything from student loan interest to mortgage payments whittle down the amount of income you actually pay tax onMoreover you dont just pay income tax to the federal government  you make contributions to Social Security and Medicare via payroll taxes and pay federal excise taxes on specific products like fuel and alcoholMashall of those components together and you get a households effective federal tax rate which is whats included in the chart above Wealthy households account for the lions share of federal tax revenue Considering individual and payroll taxes and other sources of federal tax income like excise taxes (on specific products like fuel alcohol and so on) the top 20 percent of American households pay nearly 70 percent of taxes in the United States according to an analysis by the That shares been increasing too up from roughly 56 percent of the total federal tax burden in 1979By contrast other income brackets have seen their share of federal taxes decline slightly since then The next 20 percent of households now pay less than 20 percent of taxes with households at lower income levels paying even lessWhile its a well-known fact that  dont pay  income tax its worth pointing out that when you consider the entirety of federal taxes pretty much everybody pays  even the poorest quintile of households end up with a net tax burden when you factor in payroll and excise taxes for instanceWealthy households share of the federal tax burden is rising because wealthy households are making more money The richest 20 percent made more than half of all pretax income in 2013  Thats up roughly eight percentage points since 1979But theres a lot of variation in the upper echelons of the household income scale The top 1 percent of households are on their way to doubling their share of the countrys income pie from 89 percent in 1979 to 15 percent in 2013 That top 1 percent now hauls in more money each year than the bottom 40 percent of householdsThe peeling away of the top 1 percent is a big driver of the  in the United States in recent yearsIndividual income taxes are the single biggest category of federal revenue accounting for roughly 40 percent of all money the US Treasury takes inThe other major category is tax for Social Security and Medicare accounting for another 30 percent or soCorporate income taxes make up roughly 10 percent more while excise taxes and other revenue sources account for the remainderThis distribution is very different from what it has been historically Back in the 1930s and before excise taxes    made up the largest category of federal receipts But over time the United States began to rely more on  for revenueAs a share of federal receipts taxes on Social Security and Medicare have also ballooned in recent decadesAcross the board effective federal tax rates are now lower for everyone than they were in the 1970s and 1980s Generally speaking the lower income brackets have seen the steepest percentage-point declinesOn the chart above the  are responsible for the sharp drop in the early 2000s followed by an even steeper drop due to the enacted in response to the Great RecessionAgain these numbers include not just income taxes but payroll excise and corporate taxes as well While the tax code isfairly progressive (meaning wealthier households pay higher tax rates) that hasnt stopped incomes at the top of the distribution from exploding in recent decadesIn part thats because tax ratesfor the highest individual income tiershave dropped sharply over the pastcentury  from a high of 94 percent at the end of World War II down to just under 40 percent todayTaxes in the United States at all levels of government make up a smaller share of national gross domestic product than in nearly any other of the rich countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)In 2015 for instance total tax revenue in the United States amounted to just 264 percent of GDP well below the OECD average of 343 percent Only Korea Ireland Chile and Mexico collected less tax as a share of GDPIn countries like Denmark France and Belgium by contrast tax receipts add up to well over 40 percent of GDP Those countries tend to provide much more robust social safety nets than the United States doesPart of the reason the US tax code is  is the bewildering thicket of tax breaks and deductions added by lawmakers over the years The largest of those according to the Pew Research Center is the exemption for employer-paid health care and health insurance which totals well over $150 billion a yearOther major tax expenditures include lower rates on income from capital gains exemptions for retirement contributions and the beloved mortgage interest deduction which costs the government nearly $64 billion a yearIn 2009 as their father  to his successor the twin daughters of President George W Bush Jenna and Barbara  of their ownTheir dads letter would be confidential and offer advice tucked away in the top drawer of the  in the Oval Office where incoming President Barack Obama would find it on his first day of work as leader of the free world Now a White House tradition this had been done by every sitting president since Ronald Reagan  And so as their father prepared to pass the torch the Bush girls decided they had advice to offer too not for the new president but for his young daughters Sasha and MaliaFrom one pair of first daughters to another they titled it Barbara and Jenna then 27 years old told Sasha 7 and Malia 10 to surround themselves with loyal friends to cherish their pets in times when theyd need the quiet comfort that only animals can provide to slide down the banister of the solarium and play sardines on the White House lawnMost importantly they said remember who your dad really is  Eight years later with just a week until Sasha and Malia leave the White House the Bush sisters now 35 have written a second letter  this time with advice not about living inside the White House but outside of itWe have watched you

Holmess First Daughter the Disney classic My Date with the Presidents Daughter and Chasing Liberty starring Mandy Moore and was a major plotline in Aaron Sorkins popular TV series The West Wing which often wove in the fictional presidents complicated relationship with his three daughtersThe scrutiny these fictional first daughters faced is not unlike the pressure the real ones encounter and for the pastquarter-century Americans have had only female first children in the White House Chelsea Clinton the Bush twins Malia and Sasha Obama  And perhaps no first childrenwere confronted with the

as you begin your next chapter And so will weWith the  on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) we will soon have texts to look at and eventually a vote in Congress Its the biggest deal in trade politics in several years It will be widely covered in the media against the backdrop of the presidential election  where many candidates both Republicans and Democrats are earlier this year showed that opponents of trade deals can get within striking distance of a win in the House of Representatives In the final vote itpassed by only  The administration will have to hold on to roughly the number of votes it got then and opponents will try to get a few to flipOne sticking point will be the agreements chapter on investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) My colleagues Henry Farrell and Rachel Wellhausen posted a good explainer on earlier this year Let me recap a few of the main pointsISDS is a legal system that has been included in investment treaties and trade agreements over several decades including under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Under these rules foreign investors canlegally challenge host state regulations outside that countrys courts A wide range of policies can be challenged Argentina has had its  challenged Australia its  Costa Rica its  While the United States has  US corporations have won many of their complaints against foreign governmentsThe system is unusual in international law Most international courts only allow disputes between states ISDS in contrast creates one-way rights Corporations can sue governments but not vice versaIts also  The legal challenges are decided by arbitrators hired for that case only The typical set-up is that the foreign investor appoints an arbitrator the host state appoints a second and the two parties or arbitrators appoint a third to chair the case After their decision they are paid by the parties and the tribunal is dissolvedFinally its also unusually powerful for international law Arbitrators can order governments to pay cash to the investor who can then enforce arbitrators decisions with the full force of domestic courts As the  last year domestic courts must defer to their decisions and not review theirmeritsThe White House faced substantial criticism for itsdecision to include ISDS in TPP Progressives likeSen  (D-Mass) see the system as lacking checks and balances and as an attack on regulatory sovereigntyIn response the United States Trade Representative or USTR (the trade office of the US government) hastrotted out an  of the system whichengages more with critics than in the past Not a problem was the old answer an easy position to take given that the US has never lost a caseAs TPP moves toward Congress both sides will attempt to revive the ISDS issue The White House will attempt to argue that new provisions (like a code of conduct for ISDS arbitrators) make enough of a difference to assuage critics concerns TPP opponents on the other hand will have to argue why this deal is singularly problematic when there are already 3200-plus treaties around the globe that already contain similar investor rightsIndeed the sheer volume of treaties out there is a problem for both proponents and opponents as it simultaneously reduces the costs and benefits to one-more-deal This is what I call  which legal scholars like   and  have written extensively about Investors have numerous moves at their disposal because of creeping multilateralismNationality shopping relief shopping forum shopping enforcement shoppingInvestors can shop until they drop and nations must paythe billThe figure below models the choices of an investor considering going after the Argentine government under an investment treaty Its not a merely illustrative choiceArgentina is the most frequent respondentAnd this is the status quo ante all before the ink dries on the TPP Anything that is better in TPP can be gotten around through MFN rules Many bad claims that an investor wanted to make against a TPP government could have probably already been done without TPPThis does not mean that the TPP changes nothing for investment rulesWhile TPP countries already have 35 investment treaties between themselves the new pact would raise the number effectively to  (The number is somewhat uncertain because it is not clear if Australia was successful in its efforts to be exempted from ISDS in the trans-Pacific deal) Without a TPP arbitrators had greater discretion as to whether to allow investors to game the system through nationality planning Investment arbitration claims  of dollars to litigate so the TPP will bring enhanced legal certainty to investors that want to attack government regulations in a more straightforward mannerThe TPP is also an important qualitative shift in investment arbitration While most treaties that include ISDS are between a single developed and a single developing nation the TPP is the biggest pact to date that includes many developed nations (Japan Canada Australia New Zealand and the United States) Because developed countries are more likely to have foreign direct investments in the US the US exposure to new claims  according to some estimatesWith passage of the TPP the old argument that ISDS is only necessary because of poor nations weak court systems must be officially retired Indeed ISDS would have to be seen as a core part of economic governance at the center of the worlds most important trading relationshipsI would be surprised if a TPP vote in Congress really aired all the finer points of this issue Groups concerned about ISDS will have to fight for air against all the numerous side deals being negotiated The genius of wrapping up so many issues (from auto tariffs to dairy quotas to intellectual property to regulation) in a single package is that any group or senator can usually find something to like some goody This is already on display  that dislike ISDS praising some of the TPP provisions on wildlife protectionIts a bizarre flip of what political scientists used to say about protectionist legislation One of the early studies of the legislative process was  on how protectionist legislation through log-rolling deal-making and provision-adding  became a legislative Christmas tree Now it is the (nominally) anti-protectionist legislation that brings the yuletideThe suicide bomber who blew up a youth soccer match late last month left barely a dent in the hard dry earth and only a faint scorch on a concrete wall nearbyBut he gouged a chasm of grief in the heart of the small community that lost more than two dozen of its sons in a single moment at 615 on the evening of March25A total of 43 people died in the bombing at the game according to figures provided by the local government Of those 29 were boys younger than 17 who had either been participating in the match or watching their friends playThe bomber also was a teenager no more than 15 or 16 years old judging by the picture of him released by the Islamic State which asserted responsibility for the bombing and the accounts of those who saw him at the match The militants statement said the target was a gathering of members of the Shiite paramilitary group known as Hashd al-Shaabi and the local government said two members of a militia were among the adults who diedYet that hardly explains the horror of an attack that inevitably would kill childrenThe bomber was a child and he came to kill children said Mohammed al-Juhaishi one of the sheiks from the area who lost five relatives in the blast It was a childrens soccer game Of course he knew he was going to kill childrenFor the boys of the impoverished mixed Sunni-Shiite village of Asriya 40miles south of Baghdad in the area the US military called the Triangle of Death soccer is not a pastime It is a passion and a purpose offering the dream of escape from the grim monotony of life in one of Iraqs more neglected communitiesOne such boy was Mohaned Khazaal age 10 who lived for the sake of Real Madrid his favorite team and his idol the teams star forward Cristiano Ronaldo said his brother Ahmed who is 12 Mohaned hoped one day to play for Iraq and perhaps even Real Madrid said Ahmed who dreamed of playing for Barcelona and often got into fights with his brother over which of the rival teams was better  They also both played for a local team which did not qualify for the final of the youth league tournament But they attended the match nonetheless along with an older brother Farouq 20 and almost all of the other boys living in the soccer-crazed communityThe final took place between a team called Ahli and a team called Salam which means peace The venue was a dusty field in the middle of the village unmarked except for the goal post at either end Local officials watched from plastic chairs on a small podium erected at one edge of the field The spectators most of them boys stood around the perimeter of the fieldHardly anyone seemed to notice that one of the boys watching the game was wearing a thick jacket on a warm spring evening while all the other boys were dressed in T-shirts Anmar al-Janabi 12 who was standing near the oddly dressed boy said he did notice although he did not think to say anything to the adults at the matchHe was a little tall with long hair and he looked different He was wearing a thick jacket and it was hot Anmar recalled He spoke to us He said Its a good game isnt it When the match ended the boy in the jacket joined the scramble of boys converging at the podium to watch the awarding of the trophy and the medals said Anmar who attended the match with his 13-year-old brother Bilal and a group of friendsThen he blew himself up and I felt a fire hit my face Anmar said And then I ran awayFew parents had accompanied their sons to the match that day Why would they Most lived within a couple of hundred yards of the pitch and boys gathered there every day for matches or just to kick a ball aroundAbbas Ali al-Idani did however hope to attend Earlier in the afternoon he had received an excited phone call at work from his 13-year-old son Karrar who had just found out he would be playing in goal for the Peace teamHe told me he was going to be a goalkeeper for the first time and he asked me to bring him some gloves recalled Idani who is a security guard for a local company But I was working and I couldnt leave  As soon as Idanis shift ended he rushed to a nearby store to buy the gloves He heard the explosion as he stepped out of the store Smoke was rising from the direction of the soccer field Idani jumped into his car with a sense of dreadOther people also were racing toward the field from their homes  parents brothers uncles grandparents  all of them roused by the force of the blast They arrived at the soccer pitch to find a tangled mess of broken children body parts and blood We found pieces of children There was human flesh all over the ground said Ibtisam Hamid whose 16-year-old son Walid was among the dead It was like the end of the worldAnmars brother Bilal died in his uncles car on the way to a hospital Mohaned Khazaal the 10-year-old Real Madrid fan died instantly said his brother Ahmed who escaped with a shrapnel wound to his face His 20-year-old brother Farouq was badly burned and is in a hospitalBy the time Idani reached the soccer pitch Karrar had been taken to the hospital He died before his father arrivedWhat can we say We can only thank God for everything he saidTwo weeks later the entire village remains in shock The wall beside the spot where the bombing occurred has been turned into a shrine strung with photos of the dead boys the bloodied remnants of their shirts and soccer balls Black banners announcing the deaths hang on the walls of the many homes that lost sonsInside families receive condolences in living rooms heavy with grief Parents serve glasses of tea show off photos of their dead children and cryBilal the brother of Anmar was a star student who graduated at the top of his class in sixth grade and also was an ace soccer player who three times was voted player of the year for his local team said his grandfather Hamid al-Janabi His teachers came to visit us and they were crying he said He was always near the top of his classIn a house diagonally across the street the father of Walid remembered his son in a different way He was not so good at school said Adil Abed He failed many of his exams because he was always playing soccerHe was also kind and loved birds said his mother Hamid After he died people came to see me who I had never heard of before and they told me Walid had been kind to them she saidMohaned Khazaals mother Sana Yassin Musa recalled her son in the familys meager three-roomed concrete home He was all about soccer Soccer was in his soul she saidForgotten by almost all of those who survived the carnage was the outcome of the match Among those interviewed only Ahmed remembered the score The team called Peace won he said by a score of 1-0 The teams uncollected trophy has been placed at the site of the blast surrounded by an arrangement of soccer balls flowers and Iraqi flags Mustafa Salim contributed to this reportThe graph below based on the work of economists Gabriel Zucman Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez has been receiving considerable attention since it appeared in the New York Times  It shows the rate of annual income growth for adults at each percentile in the income distribution  from those who have the lowest incomes to those who have the highest incomes  over two time periods the mid-1940s to 1980 and 1980 to 2014 Over the first period post-tax income growth was fastest at the bottom about 2 percent per year for the middle class (the 40th to the 80th percentiles) and a little slower among the wealthyThe growth pattern over the second 34-year period looks very different The richer you were the faster you got ahead Incomes grew less than 1 percent for the bottom 50 percent and less than 2 percent for the next 45 percent They then took off for the richest Americans with the growth rate for the richest adults ending up about six times that of those in the middleThe chart is a clear intuitive way to show the increase in income inequality over the past few decades and an important reminder that growth for the rich cannot be expected to trickle down to everyone elseBut it doesnt show  inequality has grown What explains this portentous change one that has had profound effects on our society our living standards and our politicsIn fact there are many perps each of which is captured in the Inequalitys Causes slide below They do however share a theme Many of the factors that enforced a more equitable distribution of growth in the earlier period have been eroded Moreover that erosion is neither an accident nor the benign outcome of natural economic evolution It is often the result of policies that have reduced workers bargaining power and supported the upward redistribution of growthStarting from the upper-left-hand corner of the slide the first two icons stand for many economists most common explanations globalization and technology Although increased trade has delivered benefits as its expanded supply chains have lowered prices it has also lowered wages for workers in trade-exposed industries a phenomenon that has been exacerbated by persistent trade imbalances Between 1946 (the year Zucman Piketty and Saezs new data start) and 1980 the United States averaged a trade surplus of 05 percent as a share of GDP since then weve averaged a 27 percent of GDP trade The technology explanation hinges on the premium earned by college-educated relative to high-school-educated workers which stands at historically high levels The idea is that employers skill demands related to computerization have increased the return to education especially in the 1980s Yet the college wage premium hasnt gone up much in  meaning tech-driven skill demands  the changes shown in the top figure Something else is going on when low-wage workers are  than theyve ever been and as Paul Krugman likes to note theres a big distance between the paychecks of schoolteachers and investment bankers despite both groups having college degreesAlthough the next graphs show only correlations theyre illustrative of that critical something else the link between diminished bargaining power for most Americans and their diminished slice of the economic pieNote the phrase full employment on the mans placard in the Inequalitys Causes slide In very tight labor markets workers with otherwise low bargaining power have a much better chance of claiming their fair share of the growth theyre helping to produce Yet as the graph below shows weve spent increasingly less time at full employment since 1980 a trend that quite closelytracks the declining median income growth that Zucman Piketty and Saez have documentedTheres also a racial justice component to this explanation This marcher is from the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom organized by the Rev Martin Luther King Jr The civil rights leader recognized this critical bargaining power role of full employment in pushing back on racism in the workplace and in fact research  that tight labor markets reduce (although do not come close to eradicating) racial disparities in unemployment The absence of full employment has thus both contributed to inequality and gaps in racial opportunity for much of the period that income inequality has grownThe rightmost icon in the top row of the Inequalitys Causes slide represents both unions and labor standards The decline of union coverage has taken an obvious toll on worker bargaining power The figure below shows another measure of inequality  the share of income going to the top 10 percent of adults each year  against union membership rates The fact that private sector union membership is now less than 65 percent is one reason even as the economy closes in on full employment wage growth has accelerated more slowly than expectedThe erosion of key labor standards has also helped hold wages down at both the middle and bottom of the income scale Policymakers havent raised the federal minimum wage for the past eight years for example and the minimum wages value is 24 percent lower than where it was in 1968 At the same time the share of income going to the bottom 20 percent has fallen sharply over the past 50 years as the next graph showsSimilarly the salary threshold below which all workers must receive overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours a week has eroded having lost more than half its value since 1975 As a result it no longer provides the income support to middle-class workers  a group whose income share also has declined a great deal since the mid-1970s  that it Moving to the bottom row of the Inequalitys Causes slide the monopoly man  new research showing that the concentration of monopoly power and profitability is squeezing the share of labor income Inequality between both wage earners and those making business profits has increased since 1980 but profits are far more skewed toward the wealthy than wages are So ashave shown when more income flows to profits and less to wages inequality risesThen theres tax policy As the next graph shows the top marginal rate has fallen over time contributing not to faster growth as phony trickle-down arguments maintain but (as one might expect) to more money for rich people Rate cuts for the wealthy and the many  that privilege high incomes both exacerbate inequality and deprive the government of revenue needed to offset inequalitys damaging effects through public investmentsYet another factor is deregulation of the finance industry which helped inflate the bubble that led to the Great Recession The largely unchecked financialization of the economy over a longer period has contributed to the   bubble bust repeat  that wreaks the most havoc on people at the bottom of the income scaleFinally the last icon in the bottom right-hand corner of the Inequalitys Causes slide stands for the political dimension of the inequality problem Inequality is partly sustained by a feedback loop as wealth concentration interacts with our heavily moneyed political system to produce policies that redistribute money  and block policies that push in the other direction Our politics are  more responsive to the interests of the wealthy than to the interests of the average AmericanGiven this multitude of causes for increased inequality (our list isnt even exhaustive) reversing the decades-long pattern shown in the top figure may seem daunting But remember much of what has occurred is the result of conscious policy choices that have transferred power  and thus income and wealth  away from folks at the bottom and middle and toward people at the very top Beneath all the data is thus a message that is simple and clear Its time we started making different choicesThe Snapchat had just about every offensive topic the middle school students could cram into a video clip race-based simulated sexual assaults profanity-laced slurs and repulsive language that shocked whoever the intended audience was  and eventually many more peopleIn a flash the Short Pump Middle School football teams sexual and racist video clip has rocketed nationwide the latest reminder that Internet posts can have enduring devastating effects in the real worldIn this case thoseconsequenceswere swift  the rest of the teams season has been canceled police are investigating the students seen in the video and the whole team  now the face of a viral video  has to undergo sensitivity trainingThe students recorded the video sometime last week and someone shared it on Snapchat It ultimately got out and spread in this Richmond suburb of nearly 25000The video is captioned What really goes on in the football locker room In the clip some of the teams white football players simulate sex acts on the black members bending them over benches or gyrating against them on the floor  Another caption says Wegonna f the black outta these black children from UgandaAn edited version of the video  and a full account of the outrage it was sparking  was broadcast on a local TV news station Parents were angered Police were called And the School Board decided it had to actIn  the Henrico County School Board said it was deeply concerned by the videoAdamantly behavior of this type will not be tolerated in our schools the letter said  We have extremely high expectations and students who fail to meet the Code of Student Conduct standards will be addressed promptly and appropriately  The letter also outlined the punishment those implicated would faceThe remaining games would be forfeited but practices would continue with a big change A mandatory component of practices will be discussions that focus on reporting responsibilities accountability ethics sexual harassment and racial toleranceBut questions still swirled Why wasnt an adult in the locker room supervising the kids per school policy Why didnt school officials notify parents before the news broadcast And why punish an entire team for the inappropriate behavior of a few studentsNo one has been chargedover the video and news outlets said investigators were trying to determine whether the black students in the video were a part of a very bad joke or were filmed against their willAs the investigation continues some claimthat the districts punishment  especially against the students whodidnt take partin the video  went too far while others said school leaders didnt go far

campaign to raise awareness about sexual harassment and assault on Capitol HillSpeier (D-Calif) urged former and current staffers to share their stories using the #MeTooCongress hashtag a play on the #MeToo social media posts thathave gone viralin reaction to the sexual harassment scandal involving Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein Thousands of women used the hashtag to share their experiences sparking dialogue about the pervasiveness of sexual harassmentIn the video Speiersaid Joe Holsinger chief of staff for then-Rep Leo Ryan (D-Calif) held her face and forcibly kissed her when she was a congressional staffer Speier did not name him in the video but identified him in response to media requests after the video published Speier was about 23 or 24 at the time and Holsinger was around 50 Holsinger died in 2004 His family could not be reached for commentI know what its like to keep these things hidden deep down inside I know what its like to lie awake at night wondering if I was the one who had done something wrong Speier said I know what its like years later to remember that rush of humiliation and anger You know what many of us in Congress know what its like because Congress has been a breeding ground for hostile work environment for far too longSpeier who has unsuccessfully pushed to overhaul how harassment cases are handled in Congress plans to introduce a bill next week to require anti-harassment training every year for all members and staffers and call for a survey to accurately gauge the scope of the problemOn Thursday Rep Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich) introduced a bill to require staffers to receive sexual harassment training every other year  Congress about the handling of sexual complaints against members and staffers and has passed laws exempting it from practices that apply to other employers There is no mandatory sexual harassment training for all employees each office decides whether its staff should receive training Federal agencies in contrast are required to provide anti-harassment trainingIt is not a victim-friendly process It is an institution-protection processSpeier recently told The Washington Post I think we would find that sexual harassment is rampant in the institution But no one wants to know because theyd have to do something about itEmployees can file lawsuits against perpetrators but only after going through months of counseling and mediation In contrast mediation is an option not a requirement for executive-branch employeesAnd when settlements are made they come out of a special US treasury fund rather than an offices funds a requirement in other federal agencies The congressional Office of Compliance the agency tasked with offering sexual harassment training when requested sent an email Friday morning reminding congressional offices to prioritize taking its sexual harassment trainingIm sharing my  moment in the hope that my colleagues & current/former staff who feel safe to do so will join me   Jackie Speier (@RepSpeier) Since the #MeToo campaign has grown lawmakers and lobbyists in statehouses across the country have adopted it to draw attention to sexual harassment in their industry In California more than 140 women including legislators and State Capitol staffers calling it a pervasive problem in California politics and urging women to speak up about their experiencesThere is nothing to fear in telling the truth and its time to throw back the curtain on repulsive behavior that until now has thrived in the dark without consequences Speier said in her video messageHuman Rights Watch on Wednesday outlined how the Trump administration would be able to go after a broad array of Muslim civic organizations if it adds the Muslim Brotherhood to its list of designated foreign terrorist organizations which administration officials have said privately they are weighingDesignating the Muslim Brotherhood has long been a cause of right-wing Republicans and US allies Egypt and the United Arab Emirates Sen Ted Cruz (R-Tex) reintroduced  pushing for the groups foreign terrorist designation last month which supporters believe will find traction under President Trump The initiatives proponents cite a widely discredited 1991 document as evidence that the brotherhood is plotting a secret Islamist takeover of AmericaMiddle East experts say the brotherhood is an Egypt-based Islamist organization that renounced violence decades ago remade itself as a pro-democracy political organization and was the most successful political party in Egypt until its leaders were overthrown in a 2013  and branded as terroristsMembers of its sister organizations and offshoots hold elected office in a scattering of other Mideast countries including Turkey where officials from the ruling party  a close brotherhood affiliate  are  with President Trumps CIA director (and a onetimeco-sponsor of a bill to designate the brotherhood a terrorist organization) Mike Pompeo on WednesdayMuslim advocacy groups and Middle East experts have warned that adding the brotherhood to a terrorist list would set a dangerous precedent  by appearing to target a group for its ideology rather than its actions  and could easily be used to go after American Muslim organizations and individuals  How would that work Laura Pitter the senior national security counsel at Human Rights Watch  Wednesday to a George W Bush-era  thatcould be applied broadly to freeze the assets of anyone found to be supporting or associating with the organization Or in the words of the order Financial sanctions may be appropriate for those foreign persons that support or otherwise associate with these foreign terrorists [as designated by the government]If the US government designates the Muslim Brotherhood a foreign terrorist group then not only its members but anyone either in the United States or abroad suspected of providing support or resources to the group would be at risk of removal from the US if they are noncitizens and having their assets frozenHuman Rights Watch wrote in a news releasePitter said the US government would also presumably be able to freeze the assets of American citizens who are suspected of support or association or charge them with material support to a foreign terrorist organizationAs the law is applied now Pitter said They can freeze assets even when they suspect that you fall under the executive order It can be exceedingly difficult to challenge starting with the logistical difficulty of hiring a lawyer without having access to any cashSupporters of the terrorist organization designation also make the claimthat the Council on American-Islamic Relations and several other major Muslim civic and advocacy groups are brotherhood front organizations Those groups as well as experts on the Islamist movement say there is no evidence to support that claim But both supporters and opponents of the terrorist designation believe it would be wielded in an effort to shut those groups downOn Monday night The Washington Post  President Trump revealed highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador during a meeting at the White House Specifically he is said to have described the details of an Islamic State threat The information itself  a close Middle Eastern allyMuch of the controversy has to do with the fact that Trump allegedly provided the information to Russia a US adversary with which he and some of his associates However in doing so he also set back US counterterrorism efforts against the Islamic State as well as al-Qaeda and other terrorist groupsIntelligence officials are usually very careful not to reveal sources and methods  the sources of information and the methods used to collect it This is for obvious reasons If the identity of a person who was the source of clandestine information is revealed then that persons life could be put at risk Similarly if the methods used to gather information secretly are revealed then adversaries may be able to protect against them in the future This is why people have been asking whether the president compromised the sources and methods used to collect the intelligence he sharedNational security adviser HR McMaster  At no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly However  does not discount the possibility that information was disclosed that could enable Russia to infer the sources and methods through which information was acquired By revealing the city where the information was collected he also may have enabled Moscow to determine the ally that provided itThe most direct and immediate impact may be to jeopardize a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State thereby making it more difficult to detect and thwart terrorist plots It is also possible that Moscow could use the information to its advantage in various ways that harm the United States or its alliesAs bad as the exposure of sources and methods would be on its own terms the long-term consequences for counterterrorism are even worse This is because Trump divulged information collected by a US ally without itspermission This was a breach of trust that is likely to damage not only the intelligence relationship with the country in question but also with other countriesMost intelligence work focuses on gathering and analyzing information and presenting it to policymakers so they can make educated decisionsCounterterrorism intelligence is different It requires identifying and thwarting threats before they happen Analysis and operations go together in preventing an attack or neutralizing a threat The United States cannot do this by itself  this effort relies heavily on intelligence cooperation from other countries  Intelligence cooperation on counterterrorism takes various forms Simple cooperation involves the exchange of single pieces of intelligence often regarding a common target such as the Islamic StateThere are also more complex forms of cooperation For example the United States has often  gathered from satellites and other sources gleaned through technical means for human source reporting that is more difficult to acquire Sometimes partners provide intelligence as part of a broader effort to maintain positive relations with the United States Intelligence cooperation sometimes extends beyond the exchange of information to include the conduct of joint operationsDespite  for the intelligence community in general and counterterrorism intelligence specifically after the attacks of Sept 11 2001 the United States relies heavily on intelligence cooperation from other countries to fight terrorism The information the United States collects via technical means can be frustratingly inconclusive and is often much more useful if paired with human intelligence Partner nations are often better positioned to collect intelligence on their own soil and to act on that intelligence when necessaryThis is partly because of numbers Even after going on a hiring binge the United States still does not have enough intelligence officers to cover all the ground necessary Partner intelligence services also often know the local language including various dialects share the ethnic and historical ties to intelligence targets and understand the cultural terrain in ways that most US intelligence officers never could  Local intelligence services are often the first line of defense when it comes to disrupting attacks like the one the Islamic State may have been planning with laptop computers on aircraft Intelligence relationships also help track foreign fighters target key nodes in terrorist networks and sever links between terrorist groups Because not every terrorist is killed on the battlefield partner services are also critical for interrogating and incarcerating suspected terrorists and determining whether US investigators will have access to themMost intelligence cooperation takes place bilaterally  between one country and another  rather than among a group of countries Anytime a country shares intelligence it risks exposing sources and methods By limiting the exchange to one recipient the intelligence service providing the information can limit this exposure make calculated assessments about what to shareThis is why Trumps decision to reveal classified intelligence to Russia could be so damaging in the long run It was not the United States to provide According to the rules of the intelligence game to share this information the United States would need permission from the country that collected it Because the partner in question had not consented the president violated a cardinal rule of intelligence cooperationThe ally that provided the information reportedly  repeatedly that it would cut off access to this type of intelligence if it were shared too widely Other countries will have taken note too If the reporting is correct that Trump provided this information in an impulsive and boastful manner the situation may be even worse Leaks in an intelligence apparatus can be plugged There is no recourse when it is the president who has a right to every piece of data shared with the United States who is the source of the problemJust like traditional alliances some intelligence relationships are deeper and more durable than others Sharing a common terrorist threat can help facilitate closer cooperation However if an intelligence relationship is characterized by mistrust this can complicate cooperation even if both countries both give the same threat a high priority Often intelligence cooperation is insulated from the ups and downs of ordinary diplomatic relations as long as both sides benefit from it But trust is essentialAfter Monday night countries worldwide will be rethinking the merits of intelligence cooperation with the United States The negative ramifications will be felt throughout the US intelligence community but counterterrorism is likely to be among the hardest hitMayor Charles Wasko appears to havetwo passions

Hopefully we can put a plan forward shortlyThe al-Khawaja family bugs the Bahraini monarchyThis week a judge in Bahrain increased the prison sentence of Zainab al-Khawaja 30 a  of two to more than five years partly on a charge of ripping up a photo of Bahrains kingBahraini authorities have imprisoned her human rights activist father for life and sentenced her sister to a year in prison and forced her into exile in Europe Her mother was fired from her job and another sister has been unable to get a government permit to work as a nurse despite finishing at the top of her nursing school classThe al-Khawaja family is a symbol and an example ofhow all of our families are suffering said Said Yousif al-Muhafdah another pro-democracy human rights activist who was jailed by the Bahraini monarchy but now lives in Germany where the government granted him political asylum because of his fear of one of Washingtons closest allies in the Middle EastThe situation of the al-Khawaja family underscores the delicate and awkward relationship between the United States and an island nation that hosts the  has sent fighter jets to help the US-led bombardment of the Islamic State and sits little more than 100 miles across the Persian Gulf from an increasingly assertive IranBahrains Shiite community which makes up a majority of countrys Muslim population has long felt discriminated against and persecuted by the countrys Sunni monarchy Shiites led a huge protest in early 2011 at the dawn of the Arab Spring at downtown Manamas Pearl RoundaboutBahraini authorities with the help of the Saudi military brutally crushed that demonstration and dozens of people died Protests have continued almost nightly in villages throughout the island and police regularly respond with tear gas bird shot and batons  resulting in deaths and maimings Several police officers have also been killedBahrain is engaged in what Amnesty International recently called a chilling crackdown on dissent that still includes torture arbitrary detentions and excessive use for force against peaceful activists and government criticsIn a written statement the Bahraini Embassy in Washington rejected the Amnesty report as unverified and unsubstantiated It said Bahrain had made monumental strides on its human rights record and reconciling with political opponentsThe statement said Bahrain had established an independent ombudsman to investigate abuses by security personnel prosecuted more than 50 police and security officers last year for criminal acts paid more than $26 million to people affected by the unrest and provided human rights training to more than 5000 police and more than half the judiciaryThis illustrates the unwavering commitment by the Government to improve transparency and accountability the statement saidWashington increasingly pushes Bahrain on its human rights record and while it continues to provide Bahrain with military equipment it withholds the export of some articles including crowd-control items and those that could be used for internal security according to a written statement from the State DepartmentBut US officials always seem extremely careful not to cross any lines that might seriously damage relations with a key ally especially at a time of rising instability in the regionThe delicate dance between the Bahrainis and Washington reached its most awkward moment last summer when Tom Malinowski the assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Democracy Human Rights and Labor was declared persona non grata and ordered to leave Bahrain after he met with representatives of a Shiite opposition party He was finally allowed to return to Bahrain in December but only after Secretary of State John F Kerry called to complain about the highly unusual breach of diplomatic protocolBahraini officials later arrested one of the opposition figures Malinowski met with Sheikh Ali Salman leader of the Shiite Al-Wefaq party A State Department statement said the United States was deeply concernedUS officials have called for the immediate release of Nabeel Rajab a prominent human rights activist who is facing up to 10 years in prison for making allegations on Twitter that the Bahraini government tortures prisoners He was sentenced to six months last year for a tweet alleging that Bahraini men who joined the Islamic State terrorist organization had previously worked for Bahraini security forces which he called an incubator of radical ideologyBahrains mainly Shiite protesters say they are sick of what they consider a Sunni dictatorship that is discriminates against them in housing employment and even religious worship They want democracyBut Bahrains Sunni government is convinced that the protests are little more than a plot backed by Shiite Iran to destabilize their nation The officials are undeterred by the fact that the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry formed after the 2011 debacle found no evidence of any foreign influence in Bahrains affairsIran has not shied away from meddling into the Bahrain domestic affairs the embassy statement said Bahrain it said has seen a surge in violence in the past few years where rioters are deploying increasingly skilled and professional targeted attacks against security personnel and civilians Several individuals have been found to receive funding training arms and guidance from Iran to carry out attacks in the countryThe protesters and human rights activists said the Bahrain uprisings are homegrown and have nothing to do with Iran But Bahrains fear of Iranian influence has only grown as the Syrian conflict the rise of the Islamic State and the Iran-backed chaos in Yemen have underscored the rising influence of Iran in the regionAmid it all the al-Khawaja family has become a potent emblem of Bahrains upheavalZainab al-Khawajas father Abdulhadi al-Khawaja 54 is serving his life sentence on charges including terrorism and attempting to overthrow the governmentThe charges stem from role as a leader of the largely peaceful pro-democracy uprising in February and March 2011 which was crushed when King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa called on his Sunni allies in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to send in soldiersAn independent inquiry also found Bahraini authorities guilty of widespread torture of detained protesters many of whom were doctors nurses and other professionalsIn the middle of the protests Bahraini police raided Khawajas home and arrested him beating him so severely that he required surgery and metal plates to put his face back together according to human rights activists who have monitored his caseHis family and rights groups say he has been tortured and abused regularly in prison since then He has staged hunger strikes and become one of the most high-profile prisonersThese sentences are a joke said Zainab al-Khawajas sister Maryam al-Khawaja 27 who has been living in exile in Denmark for years and has become a well-known international advocate for democracy and human rights in BahrainWe dont have a dysfunctional justice system we have a highly functional injustice system said Maryam al-Khawaja who spent a year at Brown University on a Fulbright scholarship and has testified in the US Congress about Bahrains rights recordMaryam al-Khawaja said she returned to Bahrain last summer despite fears that she might be arrested because she was worried about the health of her father who was on a hunger strike in prisonShe said she was arrested at the airport and charged with assaulting police officers  although she said the officers actually assaulted her She spent the next three weeks in prison She said she went on hunger strike demanding to be allowed to see her father After four days without eating she was granted a visitShe said her father was frail emaciated and could barely walk or talkShe was allowed to leave Bahrain but convicted in absentia of assault and sentenced to a year in prison She said if she returned she would be jailed so the charge was simply a way to make sure she stayed awayZainab al-Khawaja could not be reached for comment She is at home in Bahrain free despite the prison sentence against herShe has two children a 5-year-old girl and a son who was born at the end of November Maryam al-Khawaja said she believes that the government is worried about the bad publicity of throwing the mother of such a young baby in prison but added They will go for her eventuallyZainab al-Khawaja has been  and jailed several times in recent years all because of her involvement with anti-government protestsZainab has sat down in the middle of the street and refused to run in the face of tear gas and bird shot Maryam al-Khawaja said That drove them nuts Its easy to fight people who are throwing stones but what do you do with someone who refuses to budgeMaryam al-Khawaja said that during a court appearance in October her sister addressed the judge and said Im a free person born to free parents And my son when he is born is going to be freeShe then ripped up another picture of King Hamad Maryam al-Khawaja saidThere were no cameras there it was not for publicity she said She just wanted to show that she had freedom of expression and that she couldnt be silencedShe was jailed for several weeks and released a few days before her son was born in NovemberIn December she was sentenced to four years and four months in prison for insulting the king and destroying government property for ripping up photos of the king and insulting a police officer for an argument she had with a prison guard during a visit to see her fatherThis week a judge added an additional nine months to her sentence  for a total of more than five years  on a charge of trespassing in a restricted area Maryam al-Khawaja said her sister had heard that her fathers health was deteriorating so heavily pregnant she went to the prison As she approached the prison she was arrestedIn its statement the Bahraini Embassy said Zainab al-Khawajas supporters have attempted to sensationalize the charges against her For example it said she was not charged with tearing up a picture but with vandalism as she was destroying public property while in a police stationIt said she had committed more serious offenses including attempting to approach the restricted area around the prisonMs Al-Khawaja has a behavioral pattern of defying very standard procedural laws (in this case attempted entry into a prison outside of normal visiting hours) in efforts of capturing any international attention it saidIt is unfair to expect the government whichhas worked strenuously towards reform and reconciliation to remain idle as hard-liners continue to disrupt law and order in attempts to achieve personal objectives the statement saidTo understand Bahrains ongoing uprisings I  in in October 2012 and met with Bahraini government officials business leaders and human rights activists and attended several protests One Friday afternoon just before a big protest in the Old Souk at the center of Manama I met with Zainab al-Khawaja in a coffee shop where passersby asked to have their photo taken with herWe have a king who has been killing and torturing his own people she said in perfect English We should have the right to protest against thatKhawaja who earned a bachelors degree at Beloit College in Wisconsin said she had been arrested six times in the previous 10 months and that there were then 13 separate charges pending against her mainly for participating in illegal protestsShe said police broke her leg earlier that year when they intentionally fired a tear gas canister directly into her leg at close range She said she has been beaten by her jailers in front of her visiting toddler daughterShe said she ripped up the kings photo twice in front of police who were arresting her I believe that everybody should be ripping up the kings picture she said This guy is a dictator Ripping up his picture is a peaceful way to show that we do not accept this dictatorshipKhawaja was clearly fiery and passionate but she spoke of her commitment to nonviolence and peaceful change She said she was disappointed with the US governments approach to BahrainI believe in the basic goodness of the American people but not the American government she said The American government cares more about their political interests than they do about freedom and democracy By supporting the dictatorship here they are making the people feel hopelessAnd with that she tightened her head scarf and walked out into the Souks narrow alleys where police carrying tear gas and pepper spray were waiting for the protest to beginA bad year for Qatar Airways just got a whole lot worseAmid the  the small peninsular states national airline has been banned from flying to the four countries spearheading what is essentially an economic blockade Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Bahrain and EgyptThe sudden outbreak in tensionreflects long-simmering anger among the regions more conservative leaders at Qatars support for Islamists such as Egypts Muslim Brotherhood as well as its relatively congenial relationswith Iran Saudi Arabias archenemyThat Qatars only land border is with Saudi Arabia has already sent thousands to supermarkets where  But there are borders in the air too And Qatar is encircled by its aggressors its only three air borders are with Saudi Arabia UAE and BahrainSaudi Arabia has totally banned Qatari-registered planes (ie all of Qatar Airways fleet) from crossing its airspace  and because it isnt a signatory of the  it can do so legally Qatar UAE and Bahrain are all signatories but UAE has stood firm on a ban similar to Saudi Arabias  If not for a  whose airspace practically encircles Qatar the airline would have to cease operations The gesture is this all Qatari-registered planes can pass through Bahraini airspace but only along two specific routes  one for incoming planes the other for outgoing Thats like channeling a major citys traffic onto just one highway Heres a visualization of what that looks like for outgoing flightsBefore Qatars neighbors campaign to isolate the country Qatar Airways flights would regularly pass through Saudi and Emirati airspace In fact a of the airlines flights were to the four countries leading the blockade  all of which are now suspended until further notice per their According to Irans Tasnim news agency air traffic control in Iran was expecting nearly 200 more Qatar Airways flights to cross its skies per day  in other words all or almost all Qatar Airways flights will pass through its airspaceQatar Airways is a giant global airline It has 197 aircraft most of themgeared for long-haul flights to more than 150 destinations from its hub in the Qatari capital Doha It is a key player in the Oneworld airline alliance that includes American AirlinesThose planes regularly traversed Saudi airspace in particular before the crisis All flights to Africa as well as the airlines flight to Sao Paulo and onward to Buenos Aires used Saudi airspace Many more used the Emirati airspace that lies just to Qatars east toward the rest of Asia and the PacificBelow are two maps that recreate Qatar Airways flight paths before and after the blockade They show the circuitous routes the airline must now take to avoid hostile countries airspace The first is the flight from Doha to Sao Paulo The flight now makes a previously unscheduled stop in Athens presumably to refuel for the longer flights though Qatar Airways did not respond to a request for clarification The diversion adds an extra 1088 miles and two and half hours to the journey not counting the time on the ground in AthensA second map provides an even starker example Doha to Khartoum the capital of Sudan This flight usually takes three and a half hours and flies straight across Saudi Arabia On June 6 the first day of the blockade the flight looped all the way around the Arabian peninsula avoiding both Saudi and Emirati airspace and took six hours (on top of being delayed by half a day the next days return flight was canceled) The distance the June 6 flight traveled was almost double the previous daysThe delays re-bookings and additional fuel spent are sure to cost Qatar Airways a lot Another major cost is the fee that Iran levies to cross its airspace  $2000/flight  A large portion of Qatar Airways flights  to most of Europe and North America for instance  already cross Iran as more direct routes via Iraq and Syria are closed off because of ongoing conflict But now more Qatar Airways flights will incur Irans relatively high fee which may push the airlines ticket prices up driving passengers away From a geopolitical perspective this also means increased Qatari reliance on and payments to IranQatar Airways was also one of 10 airlines hit by a laptop ban introduced by the Trump administration in MarchAffected passengers cant take electronic devices larger than a smartphone on board which the airlines chief executiveadmitted has affected bookingsThe Trump administration challenged China to do more to pull its ally North Korea back from the nuclear brink as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson bluntly declared Friday that the United States will do whatever is necessary to prevent a North Korean attackAll options are on the table Tillerson said in Seoul where he underscored US commitment to Asian allies threatened by North Korea and said he would lean on China during a visit there SaturdayIn Washington President Trump goaded China which has extensive economic and political ties to North Korea but has resisted choking off the flow of money and military materials to its allyNorth Korea is behaving very badly They have been playing the United States for years Trump wrote on Twitter China has done little to helpChina has repeatedly pledged to do more but the Trump presidency like the Obama and George W Bush administrations before it accuses Beijing of going easy on PyongyangUN Ambassador Nikki Haley went further telling an interviewer Friday that the Trump administration is making a sharp pivot away from what she said was an ineffectual Obama strategy regarding China and North KoreaThere was a soft approach to China in the past presidency and what I can tell you now is were going to go harder on China Haley said on Fox News Were going to say Look if you really are wanting to partner with this if you really are wanting to stop the nuclear testing that is going on in North Korea prove it   At the least the United States wants China to enforce existing sanctions on North Korea and police what US officials have said are illicit Chinese business and banking deals that benefit the North Korean regime and its steadily improving missile-development programWe are going to go through and ask them to push towards sanctions and push towards talks with North Korea Haley saidChina says threats of military action by the United States or its allies South Korea and Japan both within range of existing North Korean missiles are unhelpful Beijing favors further efforts to negotiate with North Korea and hosted the last such international effort which failedNorth Korea is known for its exaggerated and bellicose rhetoric but the combination of threats and missile launches coinciding with Chinese anger at South Korea for deploying an American antimissile battery has raised tensions in the region to a level seldom seen in recent yearsTillerson will be the first high-level Trump administration official to go to China whose leaders were angered by Trumps frequent bashing of Beijing over trade policies during the presidential campaign and his decision to speak with the elected leader of Taiwan in DecemberTrump has tried to smooth the waters by assuring Chinese President Xi Jinping that the United States does not want a trade war and will not upend the decades-old one China policy regarding Taiwan which Beijing considers a province Trump is expected to host Xi for a visit next month at Trumps Florida estateIn contrast the Trump administration has never let up on campaign-trail criticism of China over North Korea China is also incensed by ongoing US-South Korean military exercises this month and the installation of the US missile defense system in South KoreaThe decision to put in the system was made by the Obama administration and US officials have always insisted it is intended solely for protection against North Korea But Chinese officials are expected to confront Tillerson with complaints that the system could be used to spy on ChinaThe Chinese government is now banning many imports from South Korea and stopping Chinese tourist groups from traveling there to try to prompt Seoul to change its mind on the missile systemAgainst that backdrop Tillersons meetings in China probably will be the most difficult and most important of his tripWe will be discussing with them the serious threat that North Korea poses to peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula but even beyond Tillerson said in SeoulThe United States and its allies still have options on the spectrum between diplomatic talks and military action for persuading the North Korean regime to give up its nuclear weapons he saidNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un said earlier this year that his country is working on an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the US mainland Trump responded in a tweet It wont happenTillerson has used his three-country Asian tour to underscore that the new Trump administration is fed up with years of North Korea policies that it sees as all carrot and no stickLet me be very clear The policy of strategic patience has ended Tillerson said at a news conference in Seoul with Yun Byung-se the South Korean foreign minister He was referring to the Obama administration policy of trying to wait North Korea out hoping that sanctions would prove so crippling that Pyongyang would have no choice but to return to denuclearization negotiationsIn recent months North Korea has been making observable progress toward  that could reach the US mainlandIn a surprise Yun appeared to suggest that South Korea would support military optionsWe have various policy methods available said Yun who is unlikely to remain in his position for much longer as elections for a new government will be held in early MayYun likened the diplomatic effort to restrain North Korea to a building and said military deterrence would be one of the pillars  Sanctions and diplomatic engagement so far have failed to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program But US administrations have long considered military action as nearly impossible because North Korea has artillery aimed at Seoul a metropolitan area of more than 20 million people just 30 miles south of the demilitarized zone that divides the two Koreas Thousands of US troops are also within range of potential North Korean shelling or chemical and biological attacksEarlier Thursday Tillerson toured the joint security area in the demilitarized zone a spot President Bill Clinton once famously described as the scariest place on Earth North Korean soldiers in helmets were taking photos of Tillerson from just a few feet away as the secretary stood at the line and inside the meeting hutThe Korean peninsula was divided along the 38th parallel at the end of World War II a line that was arbitrarily drawn by one of Tillersons predecessors as secretary of state Dean Rusk who was an Army colonel at the time A reporter asked Tillerson on Friday if being at the demilitarized zone brought home the threat of North Korea but he did not respond   Fifield reported from TokyoSecretary of State Rex Tillerson said the United States is in direct contact with North Korea and is looking into whether Kim Jong Un is open to talks The comment made during a brief trip to China was the first time the Trump administration acknowledged direct communication with PyongyangWe are probing so stay tuned he saidWe ask Would you like to talk We have lines of communications to Pyongyang Were not in a dark situation a blackout We have a couple three channels open to Pyongyang we can talk to them we do talk to them he saidHeather Nauert a State Department spokeswoman said later in the day that despite the US efforts North Korean officials have shown no indication that they are interested in or are ready for talks regarding denuclearizationTillersons remarks came after a day of meetings with top Chinese officials including President Xi Jinping  meetings that saw both sides strike a careful conciliatory toneThe secretary of states day-long visit comes amid an escalating standoff over how to thwart Kims nuclear weapons programIn recent weeks the conflict has devolved to an exchange of insults and threats between the US president and the North Korean dictator prompting Chinese calls for restraint  Tillerson seems to have gotten that messageIn brief statements ahead of his meetings with Chinese leaders the secretary of state did not so much as mention North Korea and nor for that matter did the Chinese Instead both sides tried to keep the focus on  which Xi promised would be a special wonderful and successful eventYet all the talk of careful planning and close cooperation could not mask the less-than-ideal circumstancesTillerson landed in Beijing on Saturday morning after a long delay due to a problem with his plane arriving on the eve of the week-long Mid-Autumn FestivalIn addition to the holiday his hosts had much on their minds For months now Beijing has been consumed with preparations for twice-a-decade political meetings to be held in October Tillerson did the Chinese the favor of staying on message saying nothing publicly that could embarrass them or signal new unexpected movesThis is keeping with his style so far On his first visit in March he surprised many China watchers by using some of Beijings preferred talking points  mutual respect and win-win cooperation  in public commentsThe question now is how Trump or Kim will chime inEarlier in September North Korea tested a nuclear bomb just hours before Xi delivered a keynote speech stealing his spotlight Then as Chinas state news media struggled to keep the focus on Xi Trump weighed in tweeting that North Korea has become a great threat and embarrassment to ChinaGeng Shuang a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry later called Trumps tweet unacceptableTillerson perhaps trying to avoid that kind of scolding ended his trip with a call for calmI think the most immediate action that we need is to calm things down he said Theyre a little overheated right now And I think we need to calm them down firstAsked whether Trumps tweets played a role he switched the focus back to KimI think the whole situation is a bit overheated right now I think everyone would like for it to calm down he saidObviously it would help if North Korea would stop firing off missiles That would calm things down a lotSen Bob Corker the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and an early supporter of Donald Trumps candidacy said Sunday that the White House had devolved into an adult day care center and warned that President Trumps behavior is setting the nation on the path to World War IIICorkers comments first made via Twitter and later in an interview with the New York Times came in response to an extraordinary feud instigated by Trump and marked the sharpest rebuke of this president by a senior Republican officeholderHe concerns me Corker  He would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation He added I know for a fact that every single day at the White House its a situation of [senior administration officials] trying to contain himThe explosive comments not only breach what had been one of Trumps few personal relationships on Capitol Hill but also jeopardize the presidents legislative priorities As chairman of the foreign relations panel Corker (Tenn) will help determine the future of the Iran nuclear deal and his support will be critical in passing broad tax cutsTrump alleged Sunday morningin a Twitter tirade that Corker recentlybegged him for his endorsement did not receive it and decided to retire because he didnt havethe guts to run for reelection next yearCorker  Its a shame the White House has become an adult day care center Someone obviously missed their shift this morningMeanwhile Corkers chief of staff Todd Womack denied Trumps characterization of his private conversations with the senator who announced last month that he plans to retire and not seek reelection in 2018Trumps outburst comes after Corker made headlines last week when he starkly suggested that the administrations national security team provides the president with badly needed adult supervision  that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John F Kelly are those people that help separate our country from chaosTrump who has little tolerance for public criticism and prides himself on counterpunching those who cross him took to Twitter on Sunday to attack CorkerTrump  Senator Bob Corker begged me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee I said NO and he dropped out (said he could not win without  my endorsement) He also wanted to be Secretary of State I said NO THANKS He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal Hence I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda Didnt have the guts to runWomack said Trump has repeatedly offered to support Corker and as recently as last week asked the senator to change his mind and run for reelectionThe president called Senator Corker on Monday afternoon and asked him to reconsider his decision not to seek reelection and reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him as he has said many times Womack said in a statementApparently unwilling to let Corkers adult day care center barb be the last word Trump tweeted Sunday afternoon that Corker was an ineffective senator and could not get the job doneBob Corker gave us the Iran Deal & thats about it  We need HealthCare we need Tax Cuts/Reform we need people that can get the job doneIn a 25-minute telephone interview with the Times Corker questioned Trumps fitness for office and said that the presidents recklessness is endangering the country  an assessment he said was shared by most other Senate RepublicansLook except for a few people the vast majority of our caucus understands what were dealing with here Corker told the Times He added Of course they understand the volatility that were dealing with and the tremendous amount of work that it takes by people around him to keep him in the middle of the roadCorker who is one of Tillersons few confidants and staunch defenders in Washington criticized a Trump tweet last weekend that undercut Tillersons negotiations with North KoreaA lot of people think that there is some kind of good cop bad cop act underway but thats just not true Corker told the Times He added I know [Trump] has hurt in several instances hes hurt us as it relates to negotiations that were underway by tweeting things out The squabble comes just days before Trump is expected to  reached with world powers in 2015 and punt to Congress a decision about whether to restore sanctions against Iran This would be the first in a series of highly orchestrated steps that White House State Department and congressional officials  primarily Corker as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee  have been planning for months  Corker has been one of Tillersons few allies and staunch defenders in Washington working closely on such issues as toughening sanctions on Russia and engaging North Korea diplomatically  two issues on which Trump has disagreed with CorkerCorker also looks to play a key role in the upcoming debate over taxes One of the Senates most committed deficit hawks and outspoken members on budgetary issues Corker already has expressed concerns with the Trump administrations proposal on tax cuts and his vote will be key to any deal getting doneTrumps attack also highlighted his increasingly strained relationship with Senate Republicans who Trump feels have failed to deliver on his agendaIn recent months Trump has also gone after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky) and Sens Lindsey O Graham (SC) John McCain (Ariz) and Jeff Flake (Ariz) with cutting and sometimes personal insultsRepublican lawmakers and operatives have voiced exasperation that Trump is spending his time attacking senators he will need as allies if he hopes to sign any signature legislationThe Corker-Trump side show which is all it is is great if you love reality TV GOP strategist Rick Tyler said We can stay tuned for the next episode But it doesnt get you anywhere It may feel satisfying but it is meaningless in the context of Republicans proving that they can be a governing majorityCorker was a prominent supporter of Trumps 2016 campaign and one of the few Republicans with gravitas willing to embrace the reality television stars candidacy before he won the GOP nominationCorker publicly praised Trumps first major foreign policy speech in April 2016 at a time during the primaries when most other party elders were shunning Trump Corker also helped tutor Trump on foreign affairs and he in turn considered the senator as a possible running mate and secretary of stateBoth Trump and Corker entered politics after careers as business executives both in real estate and construction and their shared backgrounds gave them a level of mutual understanding at a time when few in Congress can claim to understand the presidents motivations Corker was one of only a few senators to develop a personal relationship with Trump and his familyKnown for his blunt commentary Corker had long softened any public criticism of Trump or his administration with carefully worded praise But that changed this past summer as tensions between the men flared  In August Corker criticized Trumps handling of the deadly white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville saying The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successfulThen as now Corker became a  In response to the senators stability and competence comments Trump tweeted Tennessee not happyTrump later gave Corker grief about the comment during a meeting in the Oval Office according to a Republican congressional official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the private conversationsBut the episode did not seem to derail what was generally a good-natured relationship between the two When Corker later called Trump to tell him that he had decided to retire  a decision Corker made on his 65th birthday Aug 24  the president expressed disappointment the official saidMore recently Trump has fumed over Corkers tangential connection to last months Alabama Senate Republican primary runoff election in which Trumps favored candidate Sen Luther Strange was defeated by former judge Roy Moore who enjoys the backing of many of Trumps supporters in the stateCorker urged Trump to visit Alabama and campaign alongside Strange in the closing days of the runoff campaign and the president now partly blames Corker for encouraging him to get involved in a contest that has hurt his political standing according to a person close to Trump and familiar with the dynamicsMick Mulvaney director of the Office of Management and Budget said Sunday that he thinks Corker feels free to speak his mind now that he is not seeking reelectionI think its going to be fun to work with him especially now that hes announced that hes not running for reelection because I think it sort of unleashes him to do whatever and say whatever he wants to say Mulvaney   Robert Costa contributed to this reportRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump criticized US foreign policy and the American political press corps Thursday during an interview on RT America a state-owned Russian television networkIn a wide-ranging interview that aired Thursday evening Trump spoke with journalist Larry King about the presidential race American intervention in Iraq and the Middle East and the potential intrusion by Russian hackers into Democratic Party databasesRT which airs in several countries in English and Russian is funded by the Russian government though it characterizes itself as independent the networkhas been regularly accused of pro-Kremlin biasThe interview came as Trump faced sustained criticism for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin which he has regularly done on the campaign trail  to the discomfort of many members of his own party who have distanced themselves from the commentsDuring an NBC presidential forum Wednesday evening Trump went further in his praise and said that Putin has been a better leaderthan President ObamaCertainly in that system hes been a leader far more than our president has been a leader Trump saidAsked during the RT America interview what has surprised him most about the political process Trump unloaded on the American pressWell I think the dishonesty of the media The media has been unbelievably dishonest Trump responded I mean theyll take a statement that you make which is perfect and theyll cut it up and chop it up and shorten it or lengthen it or do something with itAnd all of a sudden it doesnt look as good as it did when you actually said it But theres tremendous dishonesty with the media Not all of it obviously but tremendous dishonesty he saidThe Trump campaign recently  including The Washington Post which he accused of bias in its coverageTrump also dismissed accusations that he doesnt have a firm grasp of military issues or a plan to combat the Islamic State He said he has a very distinct plan and knocked foreign policy under Obama Hillary Clinton and former president George W BushHillary Clinton with her policies and Barack Obama  you know look we should have never gone into Iraq Period We should have never gone in But once we went in Larry we shouldnt have gotten out the way we got out And the way they got out really caused ISIS if you think about it We got out in such a horrible foolish fashion instead of leaving some troops behindWhen King asked Trump if he believed reports that Russian hackers may have targeted Democratic Party databases as part of an effort to influence the American presidential election Trump said he did not believe that to be the caseI think its probably unlikely I think maybe the Democrats are putting that out Who knows But I think that its pretty unlikely he said I hope that if they are doing something I hope that somebodys going to be able to find out so they can end it because that would not be appropriateKing also asked Trump about Putins assertion that the hack was a public service even as he claimed the Russian government was not involvedI dont have any opinion on it I dont know anything about it I dont know who hacked Im not sure You tell me Who hacked Who did the hacking Trump saidTrumps critics have regularly insinuated that he is overly cozy with pro-Russian interestsTrumps former campaign chairman Paul Manafort came under fire last month after he was named in a Ukrainian corruption investigation that tied him to a pro-Kremlin political party Manafort who has since resigned from the campaign denied all such connectionsBefore that Trump was widely condemned in July when in an off-handed remark he called on the Russian government to intervene in the election by releasing thousands of Clintons private emails Russia if youre listening I hope youre able to find the 30000 emails that are missing Trump said during a pressconference at one of his South Florida resorts He added later They probably have them Id like to have them releasedRetired Lt Gen Michael Flynn  one of Trumps closest advisers  received payment to deliver a speech at an RT party last year where he sat next to Putin In an interview with The Washington Post last month he said that he saw no distinction between RT and news outlets like CNN or MSNBCTrump came under fire within minutes of the interview airing Veteran GOP strategist John Weaver a vocal anti-Trump Republican expressed incredulity on social mediaCondemning the free 1st amendment protected American media on Russian owned @RT_com is outrageous even by the lowest of Trump standards Weaver said in one tweetIm just stunned at the insanity of the campaign staff to even consider allow a @RT_com interview given the Russian ties already Weaverwrote in another tweetThe Trump campaign played down the interview Thursday evening explaining that they did not realize it would be broadcast on RTMr Trump recorded a short interview with Larry King for his podcast as a favor to Mr King What Larry King does with the interview content is up to him we have nothing to do with it a Trump spokesperson told The PostPresident Trump labeled North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un a madman with nuclear weapons during a private phone conversation with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte last month just days before stating publicly that he would be honored to meet with KimIn the April 29 call Trump sought Dutertes input on whether Kim is stable or not stable and expressed some satisfaction in North Koreas recent failed missile tests noting that all his rockets are crashing Thats the good news according to a transcript of the conversation made by the Philippines government on May2 and obtained Tuesday by The Washington PostDuterte responded that Kim is playing with his bombs his toys and offered that his mind is not working well and he just might go crazy one moment That prompted Trump to point out that the United States has a lot of firepower over there including two nuclear submarines sent by the Pentagon to the region last monthLater in the call Trump raised the stakes of the escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula when he observed We cant let a madman with nuclear weapons let on the loose like that We have a lot of firepower more than he has times 20  but we dont want to use itThe focus between Trump and Duterte on North Korea comports with a brief public  on the day it took place But the details of their conversation first reported here offer a deeper view of the urgency with which Trump is attempting to enlist foreign leaders to ramp up pressure on Pyongyang to halt its nuclear and ballistic missile programs  A senior Trump administration official acknowledged that the transcript is accurate but declined to speak on the record about a leaked document from a foreign government The Post obtained the document from a person who asked not to be identified because the transcript labeled by the Philippines government as confidential is not intended for public releaseTrump is rallying as much support as he can on North Korea the administration official said speaking on the condition of anonymity Regional support is extremely meaningful This is how hes trying to proactively manage a very difficult situationTrumps call with Duterte during which he extended an invitation to visit him at the White House groups Since taking office in June Duterte has moved to hedge on the Philippines long-standing defense alliance with the United States by establishing closer relations with China And his administration has overseen a brutal extrajudicial campaign that has resulted in the killings of thousands of suspected drug dealersTrump has not spoken out against that strategy and in their call he praised Duterte for doing an unbelievable job on the drug problemMany countries have the problem we have the problem but what a great job you are doing and I just wanted to call and tell you that Trump said according to the transcript After Duterte replied that drugs are the scourge of my nation now and I have to do something to preserve the Filipino nation Trump appeared to take a swipe at his predecessor Barack Obama who had canceled a bilateral meeting with Duterte after the Philippines leader insulted himI understand that and fully understand that and I think we had a previous president who did not understand that Trump saidOn his first foreign trip this week Trump said during a speech in Saudi Arabia that his administration will not lecture foreign governments on human rights as the United States pursues partnerships to fight terrorismThe senior Trump administration official said that the president was not condoning Dutertes individual tactics for cracking down on illicit drugs Rather this was Trumps way of expressing solidarity over a common scourge the official saidMost of his conversation with Duterte focused on how to deal with North Korea and whether China can exert more leverage on Kims regime Trump acknowledged after meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping in mid-April that its not so easy for Beijing to alter Pyongyangs behavior But when he asked Duterte whether China has power over Kim the Philippines president responded Yes at the end of the day the last card the ace has to be with China Its only China In an  three days after his call with Duterte Trump said he would be honored to meet Kim under the right circumstances opening the possibility of bilateral or multilateral talks No sitting US president has met with a North Korean leader In another interview that week with CBS News Trump called Kim a pretty smart cookie and expressed admiration for the North Korean leader having assumed power at a very young age after the death of his father Kim Jong IlTrump told Duterte he hopes China solves the problem  But if China doesnt do it we will do it Duterte then offered to call Xi and emphasize the importance of altering Pyongyangs behavior You can tell him I am counting on him Trump replied I have a very good relationship with him I had him in Florida for two days and got to know him well He is a good guyOn May 3 the Chinese state media reported that Xi and Duterte spoke about North Korea among other topics Toward the end of the call Trump switched topics calling him a good man I will love to have you in the Oval Office Trump said Any time you want to come  Seriously if you want to come over just let us know Just take care of yourself and we will take care of North KoreaPresident Trump whose demonization of Muslims was a trademark of his nationalist campaign arrives here Saturday hoping the Arab world will listen to a new messageEmbarking on his first overseas trip as president Trump plans to do a rhetorical pirouette with a speech Sunday in the birthplace of Islam preaching religious tolerance and inviting Muslims to join the United States in the fight against global terrorismAs a candidate Trump proposed banning Muslims from entering the United States warned of a Trojan horse filled with refugees slaughtering innocent Americans and proclaimed Islam hates usThe Saudis are preparing to  like a conquering king when he steps off Air Force One for his first stop of a high-stakes marathon-tour through the Middle East and EuropeThe capstone of Trumps 48 hours in Riyadh will be a speech he delivers to the leaders of about 50 Muslim countries at a summit here Sunday afternoon Trumps advisers have previewed the address as a clarion call for the Islamic world to partner against evil  National security adviser HR McMaster described it as an inspiring yet direct speech on the need to confront radical ideology and the presidents hopes for a peaceful vision of Islam to dominate across the worldThe speech is intended to unite the broader Muslim world against common enemies of all civilization and to demonstrate Americas commitment to our Muslim partners McMaster saidTrumps apparent about-face on Islam is only the latest example of him reversing his campaign position or rhetorical tone since being elected presidentHe has changed his position on lots of matters  so theres no particular reason he cant say whatever he wants to say said Elliott Abrams a former national security official in the George W Bush administration This is more delicate because its a religion youre talking aboutTrumps speech is being written by Stephen Miller the White House senior policy adviser who rose to prominence in the early days of Trumps presidency as the author and public face of the travel ban prohibiting people from seven (later restricted to six) majority-Muslim nations from entering the United StatesMiller who traveled with Trump on the campaign trail and penned many of his speeches has advocated a nationalist ideology that seeks to limit immigration to people who share what he considers to be American valuesMillers writings as a student in high school and college emphasized the threat of radical Islamic terrorism He led a  at Duke University warned of Islamofascism and argued that there was a holy war being waged against us His earlier writings were even more blunt arguing that talk of how peaceful and benign Islam is cannot change the fact that millions of radical Muslims would celebrate your death for the simple reason that you are Christian Jewish or American  Trumps political ascent was fueled by similar anti-Muslim sentiments For years Trump repeated the false suggestion that President Barack Obama was not Christian and might be Muslim Once he became a candidate Trump drew loud applause at his rallies when he railed against Muslim migrantsThis could be the greatest Trojan horse This could make the Trojan horse look like peanuts if these people turned out to be a lot of ISIS Trump said of refugees from war-torn Syria in an October 2015 interviewTrump called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States in December 2015 saying that it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehensionTrump repeatedly told an apocryphal tale about US Gen John J Pershings forces fighting Muslim insurgents in the Philippines In the story they dipped bullets in pigs blood loaded their rifles and fired them at the insurgentsAnd in March 2016 Trump told CNN   Theres a tremendous hatred We have to get to the bottom of it Theres an unbelievable hatred of usTrumps harsh campaign rhetoric appears to have set the bar extremely low in the minds of many in the Middle EastNo one is going into this thinking that Trump is good on Islam Were all going into it with the opposite idea said Shadi Hamid a  who specializes in US-Islamic relations Those low expectations might work in Trumps favor because as long as he takes care to avoid saying something terribly offensive it might be seen as neutral or even positive  Trump previewed his new less strident tone on Islam when he signed a religious liberty executive order this month Speaking in the Rose Garden of the White House the president called the United States a nation of tolerance that honors the freedom of worshipTrump said he would carry that theme to Saudi Arabia home to two of Islams holiest sites where he hopes to construct a new foundation of cooperation and support with our Muslim alliesTrump intends his address Sunday as a contrast to Obamas 2009 speech in Cairo when expectations were high that he would usher in a new era in US-Middle East relations after nearly a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan Obama said America and Islam are not exclusive and need not be in competition but share common principlesBut Obamas outreach drew mixed reviews and tensions built over some of his administrations actions that followed regarding Irans nuclear ambitions the Arab Spring and the conflict in SyriaWhile Obama often promoted human rights and democracy when he traveled abroad Trump has signaled he will not and has ingratiated himself with some authoritarian leaders whose citizens are denied basic rightsOur task is not to dictate to others how to live but to build a coalition of friends and partners who share the goal of fighting terrorism and bringing safety opportunity and stability to the war-ravaged Middle East Trump said in his Rose Garden remarksTrumps audience here Sunday will be the leaders of many Muslim nations that are not democratic states Among them is Saudi Arabia which is a rigidly controlled society that adheres to a form of Islam Wahhabism that some view as extremist noted Abrams a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign RelationsIt will be very interesting to see if human rights and democracy will be completely ignored in this speech Abrams said  In some respects Trumps posture represents at least a partial return to the position of former president George W Bush who emphasized that violent extremism does not represent Islam as a faith which he saw as essential to promoting peace Bush placed the first copy of the Holy Koran in the White House library and encouraged Americans to travel to the Muslim world welcome Muslim students into their homes for cultural exchange and study ArabicTrump has made no such entreaties In fact he has criticized Saudi Arabia for wanting women as slaves and to kill gays as he put it in a  attacking rival Hillary Clinton for accepting donations from the Saudis at her familys charitable foundationBut Trumps hosts in Riyadh see those remarks as being from a lifetime ago at least if their public comments are any indication Adel al-Jubeir the Saudi foreign minister said in a statement Leaders of Arab and Islamic nations and the United States recognize the importance of strong and enduring partnerships to confront the threat of violent extremismWith hundreds of American and Saudi flags lining the streets here the minister added There are many who try to find gaps between the policy of the United States and that of Saudi Arabia but they never will succeed The position of President Trump and that of Congress is completely aligned with that of Saudi Arabia Phillip reported from Washington Abigail Hauslohner and Jenna Johnson in Washington contributed to this reportPresident Trump not for the first time publicly contradicted his chief diplomat on a major foreign policy issue Sunday saying via Twitter that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket ManUsing his nickname for North Koreas leader Kim Jong Un and apparently warning again of a US military response to its escalating nuclear threat Trump advised  well do what has to be doneThe tweets came the day after Tillerson on a visit to Beijing told reporters the administration had and was probing for a response We ask Would you like to talk he said We can talk to them we do talk to themThe latest display of dissension follows earlier presidential put-downs and efforts by Tillerson and other national security officials to smooth Trumps rough edges on issues as diverse as US policy toward NATO Mexico and the Persian Gulf  All have sparked questions about Tillersons longevity in office with repeated speculation that he is fed up or that Trump wants him goneHumiliating for Tillerson but worse renders him useless Hell resign today or after a brief face-saving interval predicted former Obama administration ambassador and National Security Council official Dan Shapiro one of many foreign policy experts who tweeted about Trumps Sunday comments sent from his New Jersey golf clubPresident Trump spectacularly shot down SecState Tillerson after important Beijing talks How long can this last asked Carl Bildt former conservative prime minister of Sweden and current co-chair of the European Council on Foreign RelationsNeither the State Department nor the White House responded to queries on Trumps commentsTillersons aides were quick to explain on Saturday that the secretarys remarks made during a brief visit to China to plan for Trumps trip there in November did not imply that any substantive talks were underway with PyongyangThats not happening senior Tillerson adviser RC Hammond told reporters aboard the secretarys flight from Beijing There is a means by which the countries can engage with each other Hammond said adding North Korean officials show no indication that they are interested in or ready for talks on denuclearization  In Washington a senior administration official said immediately after the secretarys comments I wouldnt read too much into thatSen Bob Corker (R-Tenn) chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee warned Sunday that if we dont ramp up the diplomatic side its possible that we end up corneredI think theres more going on than meets the eye Corker said on NBCs Meet the Press While the Trump administration and the United Nations have rapidly increased sanctions against Pyongyang he said I think Tillerson understands that every intelligence agency we have says theres no amount of economic pressure you can put on North Korea to get them to stop this program because they view this as their survival Were moving to a place where were going to end up with a binary choice soonShortly after Corkers appearance Trump tweeted again Being nice to Rocket Man hasnt worked in 25 years why would it work now Clinton failed Bush failed and Obama failed I wont failKim who was preceded by his father and grandfather has been in power since late 2011  Tillerson a former ExxonMobil chief executive with no previous diplomatic experience has been under a broader cloud in office with lawmakers and others criticizing the slow pace of diplomatic appointments his acquiescence to massive budget cuts proposed by the White House and the State Departments lack of visibility on a number of issuesDeputy Secretary of State John J Sullivan acknowledged at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing last week that department morale was lowI think theres uncertainty he said and that causes  uncertainty leads people [to be] unsettled and we need to address that he saidOn the world stage whereTillerson has sought to reassureallies that the United States under Trump is a reliable partner many have concluded that his influence is limitedWith White House aides such as presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner and others given a major role in foreign policy the question of who is responsible for what segment of national security remains an open one said a senior official in the government of a close European ally speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk about sensitive diplomatic issues Unpredictability may be a useful tool with adversaries he said but with allies it creates uncertainty and irritationTillerson defended Trumps early August threat to rain  as important to avoid any miscalculation on their part But he quickly followed with reassurance that Trump was just reaffirming that the United States has the capability to fully defend itself from any attack and our allies and we will do so So the American people should sleep well at nightJim Mattis the retired Marine general who is Trumps secretary of defense has often joined Tillerson in  over military saber-rattling But Mattis a Trump favorite among the retired and active-duty military advisers around the president has been spared the belittling comments and tweets that Tillerson has endured along with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and others  Early in the administration Tillerson and Mattis as well as Vice President Pence traveled to NATO headquarters to express unwavering US support for the alliance that Trump during his campaign had called obsoleteIn late February as Tillerson was visiting Mexico Trump told a business forum in Washington that he would launch a military operation at the US-Mexico border to remove gang lords drug lords and other bad dudes out of this country at a rate that nobodys ever seen beforeAt a news conference the same day with his Mexican counterpart Tillerson chose to take the high road In a relationship filled with vibrant colors he said two strong sovereign countries will have their differencesPerhaps the sharpest dissonance occurred in June when Tillerson publicly called on a Saudi Arabia-led bloc of Arab nations to immediately cease their blockade of neighboring Qatar which they had accused of terrorism financing and he urged calm and thoughtful dialogue Barely an hour later  and said he agreed with the Saudi accusations Members of his staff have sometimes risen to Tillersons defense When a White House aide this summer publicly chastised the secretary for meddling in military matters on North Korea for his sleep well comment State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert bristled Hes a Cabinet secretary she said Hes fourth in line to the presidency He carries a big stickTillerson himself has largely refused to talk about any frustration he may feel toward Trump There is no gap between the president and myself or the State Department on policy he told Congress in late June There are differences in terms of how the president chooses to articulate elements of that policyMore recently following Augusts neo-Nazi violence in Charlottesville Tillerson was asked on Fox News Sunday about the values of a president who said many sides were to blameThe president speaks for himself Tillerson replied David Nakamura and Carol Morello contributed to this reportPresident Trump is strategically separating himself from Republicans in Congress an extraordinary move to deflect blame if the GOP agenda continues to flounderTrump deepened the fissures in the party on Thursday when he accused the top two leaders on Capitol Hill of mismanaging a looming showdown over the nations borrowing authority Republican lawmakers and aides responded to the presidents hostility with broadsides and warnings of their own Frustrated by months of relative inaction at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue and emboldened by his urge to disrupt the status quo Trump is testing whether his own political following will prove more potent and loyal than that of his party and its leaders in both houses of CongressThe growing divide comes at an inopportune moment for Washington however In addition to having to raise the debt ceiling to avoid a fiscal crisis Republicans face September deadlines to pass a spending bill to avert a government shutdown as well as pressure to fulfill a key Trump campaign promise to rewrite the nations tax lawsBehind the scenes some Republican staff members described a more functional relationship between aides and lawmakers on Capitol Hill and White House officials But in public Trump is waging war against lawmakers With a pair of morning tweets he said he asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) and House Speaker Paul D Ryan (R-Wis) to include a debt-ceiling increase in a recent veterans billI requested that Mitch M & Paul R tie the Debt Ceiling legislation into the popular VA Bill (which just passed) for easy approval he wrote They  didnt do it so now we have a big deal with Dems holding them up (as usual) on Debt Ceiling approval Could have been so easy  now a messIn a later tweet the president slammed McConnell for not being able to pass a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act That should NEVER have happened he wroteTrump is railing against Republicans because he thinks it will help him politically down the road for instance during a 2020 reelection bid said one outside adviser to the White House If Republicans lose the House in the 2018 midterm elections as several White House advisers have warned the president Trump can say See I told you these guys wouldnt get anything done Ive been saying this for months Theyre not following my agenda said the adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private talks Roger Stone an ally of and former political adviser to Trump put it this way The Trump brand and the Republican brand are two different things What happened the last time the establishment tried to face him down They got crushedIf Republicans lose the House however Trump could face greater peril than a difficult 2020 election a Democratic majority eager to pursue impeachment and with subpoena power to conduct investigations  For many GOP lawmakers the justification for not fully breaking from Trump has been the promise of trying to salvage key parts of the partys agenda But now they are increasingly resigning themselves to the reality that they will be largely on their own One Senate GOP aide likened it to being handed the keys to the carAs a result they have grown increasingly hostile toward the president It doesnt help at this point with a September coming up that is very consequential to be throwing rocks at one another said Rep Tom Cole (R-Okla) He added You dont I think do a lot of good by torching your teammates particularly by name individuallySaid the Senate GOP aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid The sense you get is Were going to have to figure this out Were just going to assume were not going to get any help from the White HouseSome White House aides have shown little sympathy toward GOP lawmakers who have made harsh remarks about Trump Asked Thursday to respond to recent comments by Sen Bob Corker (Tenn) doubting the presidents competence and stability to lead White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded I think thats a ridiculous and outrageous claim and doesnt dignify a response from this podiumThe relationship between Trump and McConnell meanwhile has become increasingly acerbic in recent weeks in private and public But as details have surfaced in news reports McConnell has tried to project unity even as some Republicans have said tensions are still rawIn remarks Thursday morning at the Kentucky Farm Bureaus annual Country Ham Breakfast McConnell praised the president and his administration for making strides on regulatory reform the Supreme Court and looking out for rural Americans But he acknowledged differences on trade saying he was a little concerned about some of Trumps protectionist rhetoric He also cracked a joke that underscored the challenges he faces with a narrow majority in the Senate Im often asked What is being the majority leader of the Senate like he said The best answer Ive been able to think of is Its a little bit like being a groundskeeper at a cemetery Everybodys under you but nobodys listening Thats what you get with 52-48McConnell sees a 2018 Senate map ripe with opportunities to expand the GOP majority For this reason Republicans in his orbit have been particularly pained by Trumps attacks against Sen Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) a critic of the president who is up for reelection They see the leader of their party Trump potentially sabotaging a chance to make it easier to pass the legislation he has complained about stallingThe Trump administration has warned that Congress must raise the federal debt limit before October to avert a fiscal crisis The government spends more money than it brings in through revenue and it borrows money to cover the difference by issuing debt During an event in Everett Wash on Thursday Ryan said he is confident that Congress willraise the debt limit and avoid a federal default We pay our debts in this country and well continue to do so he said Im not worried thats going to get done because its going to get doneRyan acknowledged discussions about attaching the debt issue to the veterans bill but said the maneuver ultimately wasnt available to usSeveral House aides expressed exasperation Thursday about Trumps claim regarding that proposal They called that a misrepresentation of what had actually happened White House and congressional aides had informally discussed the possibility that the Senate could attach a debt-ceiling extension to a House-passed veterans bill in late July but it was never clear that the Senate would act before the House was scheduled to break for the summer  and many conservative House Republicans had warned GOP leaders not to pursue the maneuverTrumps threat this week to shut down the government if a spending bill to keep it running past the end of next month does not include funding to construct a wall along the US-Mexico border has compounded worries about the September to-do listWe dont need a government shutdown That never ends well Flake told Fox News Channel on Thursday We dont save money doing itThe House Freedom Caucus stands to play a pivotal role in the falls legislative drama On one hand the bloc of hard-liners has been among the most fervent backers of Trumps agenda and its top leader Rep Mark Meadows (NC) frequently consults with the president On the other hand the caucus and other conservatives have been reluctant to compromise on their principles to accomplish it  at least not without a fightRepublicans control the House Senate and White House Rep Mark Walker (NC) a member of the Republican Study Committee wrote in an opinion piece published this month Any legislation signed into law needs to reflect unified governmentCongressional Democrats are expected to stand firmly in opposition to Trumps attempt to secure more federal funding for the border wall as they did in the spring during similar spending talksOn the debt limit Democrats are taking a more hands-off approach thinking the issue is entirely up to Republicans to resolve given that in the past they called for spending reductions to be coupled with any debt-limit increases Some congressional aides are anticipating that Trump will hold a White House meeting with top House and Senate leaders shortly after lawmakers return from their recessIf a meeting is held it would be the first face-to-face exchange between Trump and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) since the president hosted a cocktail reception for top lawmakers in late January The last time he saw Senate Minority Leader Charles E Schumer (D-NY) in person was the day after that reception at a meeting about Supreme Court nominees Some Republicans hope that private negotiations on tax reform the debt ceiling and keeping the government running wont be weighed down by ugly public feuds One senior Republican involved in the process said Thursday that a relatively drama-free extension of the debt limit and a resolution to keep the government open until the end of the year are both likely to pass next month with discussions about a border wall pushed into the next round of budget negotiationsA second Republican who has spoken with the president said Thursday that Trump sees benefits from fighting GOP leaders but is not yet convinced that a showdown over a wall in September is necessary and is open to hearing options about how to proceed The Republicans spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid Still the long-term political upside that many in Trumps inner circle see in going after congressional Republicans and the hard-line stances Trump is fond of taking are expected to complicate the delicate talks They also raise the possibility that Trump will never ease up in his attacks This is where the base already was They hate Washington said Barry Bennett a former Trump campaign adviser He added They dont need the president to tell them that Congress isnt doing its job They already understand that Ed OKeefe Damian Paletta and Robert Costa contributed to this reportAhead of President Trumps much-anticipated speech in Saudi Arabia delivered before a gathering of Muslim statesmenon Sunday there was a great deal of speculation into what Trump would say about Islam  a faith after all that he once claimed

Trump followed up with equally harsh languagesaying thatall nations of conscience must work together to isolate Iran He also offered no criticism of the Saudi-led war in Yemen which has seen high civilian casualties and This whole meeting looked like a Sunni international in which the main non-Sunni power in the Muslim world Iran was bashed by both the American President and his Sunni hosts  This is not going to help anything other than adding to the sectarian divide It is not fair either Iran has lots of sins to account for  including its cynical support for the bloody regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria But most radical Islamist terrorists in the region are Sunni not Shiite In fact in terms of their theology and jurisprudence they are much closer to Saudi Arabia than IranIn  Irans foreign minister Javad Zarif cheekily warned Trump about his new business partners Critics of Saudi Arabia routinely point to the fact that its state-sanctioned orthodox brand of Islam has fueled decades of extremism Zarif referred to the Saudi origins of many of the 9/11 attackersTrump must enter into dialogue with them about ways to prevent terrorists and takfiris from continuing to fuel the

that includes $110billion in American arms sales and other new investments that the administration said would bring hundreds of thousands of jobsIt was a great day Trump said He cited tremendous investments in the United States and jobs jobs jobsWhile initial details were scant the agreements signed included a US letter of intent to support Saudi Arabias defense needs with sales of a number of items  naval ships tanks and other vehicles  that were the subject of agreements under earlier administrations as well as some new items that had never passed the discussion stage such as sophisticated THAAD missile defense systemsOther items are intended to modernize Saudi Arabias cyberdefense and airborne intelligence-gathering and secure its borders  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a news conference with his Saudi counterpart described common views on counterterrorism the threat from Iran and regional security He outlined like-minded goals in the security and economic spheres and said Were very proud of this relationship that we are embarking on with the kingdomWhat emerged as a veritable love fest between the two governments was a marked contrast to years of growing estrangement under President Barack ObamaThis is the beginning of a turning point in the relationship between the United States and the Arab and Islamic world Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir proclaimed alongside TillersonTrumps visit he said begins to change the conversation with the Islamic world from one of enmity to one of partnershipIn addition to the security agreements Jubeir said US business leaders here at an economic forum designed to coincide with Trumps visit signed deals potentially worth more than $200billion over the next 10yearsExecutives from a number of major US companies unveiled investment partnerships with the Saudis including Blackstone a private-equity giant that announced a $40billion infrastructure fund Stephen A Schwarzman Blackstones chairman and

at a mens-only concert in Riyadh on Saturday night coinciding with Trumps visit As Trump and Salman were driven in a golf cart around the palace after dinner the president trained his eyes on a jumbo screen playing the live concertThe ebullient welcome reflected a kingdom eager to rekindle its relationship with the United States and to use the visit to declare and solidify its own leadership role in the Muslim worldJubeir in the news conference with Tillerson heaped praise on Trump saying that the foreign policy novice had the vision strength and decisiveness in the estimation of the Saudi leadership to bring peace between Israelis and Palestinians The minister went on to borrow one of Trumps favorite campaign slogans saying that a new relationship between the United States and the Arab world could drain the swamps from which extremism and terrorism emanates  In their private talks Trump and Salman discussed their shared view of the threat from Iran Asked about Fridays reelection of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani Tillerson said he hoped Rouhani would use his term to begin dismantling Irans network of terror stop destabilizing the Middle East end ballistic missile testing and restore basic rightsHowever there was public silence from the US delegation on the issue of human rights in Saudi Arabia which has imprisoned peaceful critics of the government and has sharply restricted the rights of women Ahead of the visit Trumps advisers said the president did not intend to lecture his hostsObama who sold about $115billion in US weapons to Saudi Arabia during his eight years as president had slowed military cooperation with the kingdom in large part because of what it considered Saudi Arabias indiscriminate bombing of civilians in Yemen The Trump deal puts those agreements back on track and expands themBeyond the closed-door meetings this desert capital was decked out for a celebration As Riyadh baked in triple-digit heat under a pall of dust American and

official delegations discussed issues including oil Iran and Syria Saudi Arabia is part of the US-led coalition against the Islamic State but relations were strained with Obama over his failure to push for the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad with strong support for rebelsDuring his campaign Trump indicated that he was uninterested in US involvement in Syrias civil war But as president he has spoken out against Assad and last month launched a cruise missile attack against a Syrian government air baseAs they chatted following the award ceremony Salman was overheard telling Trump that Syria too used to be one of the most advanced countries We used to get our professors from Syria They served our kingdom Unfortunately they too brought destruction to their own country You could destroy a country in mere seconds but it takes a lot of effort  On Sunday Trump will meet with the heads of the six Persian Gulf monarchies of the Gulf Cooperation Council and an Arab Islamic American Summit of at least 40 nations primarily from the Middle East Africa and AsiaBefore a royal banquet Saturday night Trump met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef the heir to the Saudi throne and separately with Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who visited Trump at the White House earlier this spring  The highlight of Trumps stop in Riyadh is expected to be a speech on Islam that he will deliver Sunday to the larger summit meeting Though his campaign was marked by harsh anti-Muslim rhetoric Trump is planning to preach religious tolerance here inviting the Arab world to join the United States in combating terrorism and evil in the regionTrump according to an advance portion of the remarks he will deliver will describe the fight against radicalism as a battle between good and evilThis is not a battle between different faiths different sects or different civilizations the president will say according to an administration official This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life and decent people of all regions who seek to protect it This is a battle between good and evil Trump also planned to participate in the inauguration of a new Saudi

then visits Brussels for a meeting with NATO leaders including a bilateral session with newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron and finally to the Italian island of Sicily where he will attend a Group of Seven summit of the United States closest economic allies Ashley Parker in Washington contributed to this storyPresident Trump departed Washington on Friday for his first visit to Asia a 12-day swing through five countries that comes as the once unthinkable has become a palpable concern from Tokyo to Seoul to Beijing  a war with a nuclear-armed North Korea  and Pyongyangs accelerating weapons programs have set the region on edge and prompted national security adviser HR McMaster to declare this week that the world is running out of time to stop the NorthNorth Korea is a threat to the entire world McMaster told reporters at the White House   with bilateral visits to Japan South Korea and  and stops at regional summits in Vietnam and the Philippines  could go a long way toward determining the success of his administrations policy Aides said they are committed to applying maximum pressureon Pyongyang to  and resolve the situation peacefullySenior White House aides said Trumps top priority on the longest overseas trip of any president since George HW Bush in 1991 will be to build on the initial success his administration has had in rallying international support for isolating North Korea Responding to pressure from the United States the United Nations Security Council approved two rounds of stiffer economic sanctions and a growing number of countries have severed diplomatic ties with Pyongyang and banished North Korean guest workersBut beyond the sanctions and the silent treatment looms the very real prospect that none of these tactics  employed to varying degrees by previous administrations  will persuade North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to veer from his pursuit of a nuclear weapon that can reliably reach the US mainland  a goal analysts said would sharply tilt the leverage in his favor in any future negotiationsThat raises the question being privately assessed and publicly debated across Northeast Asia How real are Trumps threats of using military options to prevent Kim from succeedingI think the Chinese are divided on the seriousness of President Trump about the potential of a US military strike said Bonnie Glaser a China analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who visited Beijing last week Some say President Trump is unpredictable and that he could launch a preventative or a preemptive attack They worry the situation is getting out of control Other experts said they think Trump is bluffing to scare Beijing into greater pressure on KimGlaser added I sensed more of the former view Theres more seriousness about the considerations being taken by the Trump administration  In Tokyo Prime Minister Shinzo Abe raised eyebrows during a gathering of international foreign policy experts last week when he acknowledged that there is some worry about applying that much pressure on North Korea and whether this will lead to warThe Japanese leader whose governing Liberal Democratic Party emerged stronger last month after winning more parliament seats in a snap election emphasized that his administration fully supports Trumps position that direct diplomatic talks with Pyongyang are not worthwhile given Kims consistent provocationsOf course I do not wish for a conflict Abe said at the Mount Fuji dialogue However dialogue with North Korea for the sake of dialogue is meaninglessIn Seoul Trumps handling of the North Korea crisis has led to a number of angry public protests ahead of his arrival  and widespread confusion and apprehension over his intentions President Moon Jae-ins administration which came to power this year advocating a more open policy toward the North that favored talks has sought to align more closely with the United States in the wake of Kims increased nuclear and ballistic missile testsBut Moons aides objected to White House proposals that Trump  that divides North and South Korea over fears that his rhetoric would further inflame tensions at a time when the South is preparing to play host to the Winter Olympics early next year Trump has threatened that Pyongyang would feel the fire and fury of the US military if it continued its threats and the president pledged during a speech at the United Nations in September to totally destroy the North if necessary The White House agreed to have Trump instead visit Camp Humphreys a joint US-South Korea military base south of Seoul But at recent protests South Koreans waved signs that superimposed the American leader over nuclear explosionsPresident Trump is frequently making ludicrous comments implying war said Han Sun-bum a representative of one of the largest protest groups the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions His comments coupled with large-scale joint military exercises have created a very precarious situation in the Korean PeninsulaTrumps trip includes heavy messaging on the US commitment to strong defense cooperation with allies in East Asia The president will stop first at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii where he plans to tour the USS Arizona the battleship sunk during the Japanese surprise attack in 1941 that drew the United States into the Pacific theater in World War IIIn Tokyo Trump is scheduled to speak with US troops at Yokota Air Base and meet with the families of Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korean agents in the 1970s In Seoul he will address the South Korean National Assembly emphasizing that all nations must act with increased urgencyAsked whether Trump plans to use the same type of inflamed rhetoric he often has when discussing Pyongyang McMaster said I dont think the president really modulates his language He added Ive been aware of the discussions about Hey is this inflammatory And whats inflammatory is the North Korean regime and what theyre doing to threaten the worldForeign policy experts called Trumps public threats and belittling of Kim  the president has dubbed him Little Rocket Man  a misguided attempt to apply psychological pressure In fact they said such tactics allow Kim to further demonize the United States  One former Obama administration official called Trumps rhetoric sophomoric and said it was a primitive misreading about how they operateThis former official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak bluntly said that if Trump veers off the teleprompter into belittling insult-land that could significantly increase the distress felt throughout South Korea where some hard-liners in parliament have suggested the nation should consider developing its own nuclear arsenalMeantime China where Trump will make a three-day state visit has announced a crackdown on banks that do business with North Korea although experts said it is hard to gauge how seriously Beijing will implement the new controls Chinese President Xi Jinping emerged more powerful after the Communist Party Congress last month and Cui Tiankai Chinas ambassador to the United States told reporters this week that the United States and its allies could do more to resolve the standoff peacefullyIf only China is making its best efforts and others are doing things that lead to an escalation of tensions this issue will not be solved Cui saidThe Trump administration following the policies of past administrations has refused to entertain the Chinese proposal of freezing US and South Korean military cooperation in exchange for a freeze on North Koreas weapons testing McMaster ruled out the idea again this week saying Pyongyang cannot be trusted to abide by any such agreementsWere out of time McMaster said In terms of scenarios the presidents always very clear You know he doesnt draw red lines he doesnt forecast directly or say directly what hes going to do But hell do whatever it takes to protect the American people and our allies Taylor reported from Seoul Yoonjung Seo in Seoul contributed to this reportRepublican nominee Donald Trump pleaded directly Wednesday with the Russian government to meddle in the US presidential election by finding and releasing tens of thousands of private emails from his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton  an extraordinary and perhaps unprecedented maneuver in American politicsRussia if youre listening I hope youre able to find the 30000 emails that are missing Trump said during a news conference at one of his South Florida resorts He added later They probably have them Id like to have them releasedAsked whether Russian espionage into the former secretary of states correspondence would concern him Trump said No it gives me no pause If they have them they have themThe emails cited by Trump are from Clintons time at the State Department where her use of a private server prompted a federal investigation The FBI concluded that no prosecution was necessaryThose are different than emails from the Democratic National Committee that were leaked ahead of the party convention here possibly with the involvement of Russia The FBI is investigating whether Russian state actors were responsible for leaking the politically damaging messages last Friday in an episode that forced the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman SchultzPresident Obama who was scheduled to address the convention on Wednesday night told NBC News in an on Tuesday that Russia could be working to influence the electionWhat we do know is that the Russians hack our systems not just government systems but private systems Obama said What the motives were in terms of the leaks all that  I cant say directly What I do know is that Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed admiration for Vladimir PutinClinton campaign manager Robby Mook responded to Trumps Wednesday comments with a tone of disbelief telling reporters that the apparent hacking was a national security issueIt appears the Russians did steal these emails from the DNC Mook said at a lunch sponsored by the Wall Street Journal It appears as if they were active in releasing them for the purpose of hurting the campaignBut Rep Devin Nunes (R-Calif) the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said any such speculation is unfounded There is no evidence absolutely no evidence that the Russians are trying to influence the US election he said in an interviewDemocrats have labored all week to put Trump on the defensive over his business and personal ties to Russia as well as his professed admiration for its president Putin as a model leader Some have portrayed Trump as Putins Manchurian candidateVice President Biden roused thousands of delegates at the Democratic National Convention here Wednesday night by excoriating Trump as unfit to be commander in chief We cannot elect a man who belittles our closest allies while embracing dictators like Vladimir Putin he said  The candidate and several of his top advisers have business connections to Russia Campaign chairman Paul Manafort has made millions of dollars in business deals with pro-Russia oligarchs as well as advised the Putin-aligned president of Ukraine whose 2014 ouster triggered Russias intervention thereTrump seemingly played into Democratic hands on Wednesday by praising Putins leadership qualities and vowing that US relations with Russia would improve if he is elected in NovemberI dont think Putin has any respect whatsoever for Clinton Trump said He added He has a total lack of respect for President Obama  I think hes going to respect your president if Im elected And I hope he likes meIn a series of afternoon tweets Trump spokesman Jason Miller said the candidate was merely encouraging other countries to turn over any information relating to Clintons emails to US authoritiesTo be clear Mr Trump did not call on or invite Russia or anyone else to hack Hillary Clintons emails today Miller wrote  Still Trumps provocation alarmed many Republican leaders and foreign policy experts  not only for his disjointed discussion of Russia but also for the signal it sent about their standard-bearers worldview Many were also alarmed by Trumps remark Wednesday that he would be  whether Crimea which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014 should be recognized as Russian territory He has repeatedly questioned the need for NATO the main Western bulwark against Russia He told an Ohio rally crowd Wednesday night that if a nation has not paid enough toward defense costs asks for help he would respond Bye byeRather than approaching Russia with trepidation Trump embraced Putin as a future ally and said he hoped to develop a chummy and mutually beneficial rapport with one of the globes notorious strongmen In doing so Trump broke with decades of Republican instincts that were honed during Ronald Reagans presidency at the end of the Cold WarForeign governments sometimes express preferences about who should be elected thats already problematic said Eliot A Cohen a former counselor in George W Bushs State Department But to do something in the nature of dirty tricks would be a very very serious problemTrumps running mate Indiana Gov Mike Pence issued a statement minutes after Trumps remarks that hewed closely to established GOP orthodoxy Instead of baiting the Russians to reveal Clintons emails Pence said that the FBI must get to the bottom of who is behind the hackingIf it is Russia and they are interfering in our elections I can assure you both parties and the United States government will ensure there are serious consequences the statement continuedIt was unclear whether Trumps declaration would hurt or help him politically Such comments by a normal candidate in a normal election year would be a seminal and possibly fatal episode Yet neither Trump nor this year are typical  and as with past controversies voters may not take Trumps commentary seriouslyPartisan figures rallied immediately to Trumps defense blaming the mainstream media for blowing Trumps comments out of proportion and trying to shift the focus from Clintons judgmentWhats irresponsible is that more than 30000 emails were deleted by a crook who broke the law former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga) said in an interview I dont care if its the Bulgarians the Chinese or Haitian immigrants studying at Stanford Lets see

Tom Hamburger and Anne Gearan in Philadelphia contributed to this reportPENSACOLA Fla  In a wide-ranging speech on Friday night Donald Trump said that as president he would shoot Iranian boats out of the water if they make improper gesturestoward American vessels thatHillary Clinton is so protected from having to face consequences that she couldmurder someone in front of 20000 witnesses and not face prosecution and that voters need to be very very vigilant on Election DayEver since he installed new campaign leadership about three weeks ago Trump has softened his tone on the campaign trail and mostly stuck to prepared rally speeches loaded onto teleprompters That level of discipline seemed to fade during a rally in a packed arena in the Florida Panhandleon Friday nightAs Trump shared his plans to dramatically grow the depletedmilitary andgrow the number of Navy ships to 350 he brought up Iran a country he has frequently said takes advantage of the United States generosityAnd by the way with Iran when they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they shouldnt be allowed to make they will be shot out of the water Trump said to thunderous applause Soon the crowd began to chant USA USA USAIn late August and maneuvered in ways that US officials deemed harassing and unsafe The American warships repeatedly signaled to the Iranian vessels to stop and at one point fired three warning shots into the waterTrump also continued his attack on Clinton saying that she has escaped punishment for using a private email server while serving as secretary of stateShe is being so protected she could walk into this arena right now and shoot somebody with 20000 people watching  right smack in the middle of the heart  and she wouldnt be prosecuted okay Trump said exaggerating the capacity of the Pensacola Bay Center which can only hold 12000 Thats whats happened That is whats happened to our country I never thought Id see the day where this is happening to our countryIt was reminiscent of a commentTrump madein late January when he told a rally crowd in Iowa They say I have the most loyal peoplewhere I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldnt lose any votersLater in the rally Trump said that Clinton could not be trusted to make clear-headed military decisionsHer policies have produced only death destruction and not diplomacy Trump said Shes trigger-happy and now shes trying to say like shes this  let me tell you folks personally Personally I think shes an unstable person Okay She is trigger-happyThe crowd cheered Trumps personal take and a few women in the crowd started chanting Lock her up Lock her upTrump also defended his campaign slogan Make America Great Again which former president Bill Clinton has recently suggested is a coded message to white Southerners becausethe the good old days  werent all that good in many ways Trump praised the media for pointing out that Clinton said the same words make America great again while campaigning for president in the early 1990sMake America great again  racist racist Except he used it A lot Trump said Surprised I thought it was just ours Its just one more Clinton lie And even the media reported it as a big fat juicy lie Thank you very much fellas Finally FinallyAnd Trump once again suggested that he might lose the election because of voter fraud telling his crowd Be very very vigilant on November8 Watch whats happening Watch whats happeningTrump was only interrupted once by protesters during his hour-long

arrived in Busan South KoreaDoes this type of signaling work States use many different tools to send firm signals about their international intentions and capabilities In recent weeks the Trump administration has sought to send a message to rivals through tough actions such as a  and dropping the  in Afghanistan  In a recent New York Times article Max Fisher argued that there is  evidence signals can convey a countrys resolve or that states can establish a global reputation for resolve Although signaling  particularly when it involves sending messages about different situations in different parts of the world  is indeed challenging there is actually a large body of evidence that shows that signaling and reputation matterBut signaling is difficult to pull off effectively The nature of signals as well as who does the signaling is importantFisher paraphrasing political scientist  says that a successful signal in international relations must be precise and backed up by action demonstrating capability and intent to follow through US troops deployed in South Korea would be a good exampleHowever the evidence suggests many other signals might work just as well In fact troops might not even be the most effective signal  find that even a strong signal like deploying nuclear weapons to a client state that a major power wants to protect might not be the best option Theres a better deterrent simply establishing an alliance agreement between the nuclear power and the client state  Similarly in an experiment looking at responses from elite politicians  members of the Israeli Knesset   found something surprising Although both troop mobilization and public threats increase perceptions of others resolve decision-makers didnt find one type of signal as significantly more credible than the otherIn the same study they noticed different observers had different views about the type of signal they see as conveying resolve So hawks tend to view troop mobilization as a more credible indicator than public threats Doves on the other hand viewed threats as the more credible signal Roseanne McManus shows that statements designed to show a leaders resolve can significantly impact the outcome of international military disputes  McManus also shows a visit by the leader of a major power to a weaker country can credibly signal support for that country  and help deter attacksWhen he visited South Korea recently Vice President Pence made a point of being seen out and about along the demilitarized zone (DMZ) Afterward he  publicly I thought it was important that people on the other side of the DMZ see our resolve in my faceA growing body of literature in international relations argues that up-close expressive signals work For example research by  suggests that national leaders do form impressions of each others intentions based on facial expressionsMore broadly research by  shows leaders draw heavily on vivid indicators when assessing the intentions of adversaries This means they pay attention to face-to-face interactions and other expressive signals such as body language facial expressions demeanor and tone of voiceNevertheless expressive signals seem to work when they dont appear carefully orchestrated but rather reflect the leaders true feelings and resolve Thus if Pence wants to send signals this way he would be better off not declaring his strategy In other words the first rule of resolve face is you dont talk about resolve faceReputation matters  thats the answer many scholars would give When a leader makes a statement of resolve or a gesture of support for a client state the leader is putting his or her reputation on the line Backing down from that message would damage the leaders credibilitySeveral studies have shown that reputations matter  shows that resolve is a personal characteristic suggesting that some global leaders should have reputations for resolve while others do not In another study  find that countries that backed down in past crises were significantly more likely to be challenged subsequently But countries that stood firm in previous crises were far less likely to be challenged in future disputesMore recently  conducted a survey experiment looking at how the statements and behavior of leaders contribute to their reputations She found that verbal signals of resolve create expectations of future behavior  and initial interactions during a new leaders tenure are particularly influential to the reputations of new leadersIn another survey experiment  find evidence that both individual leaders and states as a whole can establish reputationsAlthough some  remain  of the importance of  generally and the ability of leaders to signal resolve effectively a broad view of international relations scholarship offers substantial evidence that when employed skillfully signals of resolve and reputations for resolve can powerfully affect international affairsHowever this is not to say that Trumps signaling strategy will necessarily be effective Fisher and others have rightly pointed out ambiguity and inconsistency in Trumps signaling which might make adversaries uncertain what to believe This could undermine the administrations ability to credibly convey its resolve in the future  research also suggests that Trumps domestic political weaknesses may undermine his signaling abilitySo while the Trump administrations signals of resolve can be effective in theory his administration has a long way to go to craft an effective signal in practicePresident Trump is not likely to visit the Korean demilitarized zone during his 12-day trip to Asia next month a White House official said MondayTrump plans instead to speak to US and South Korean troops at Camp Humphreys about 55 miles south of Seoul at the invitation of President Moon Jae-in the official saidSince Ronald Reagan every American president except George HW Bush has visited the DMZ the heavily guarded strip of land that has divided North and South Korea for 64 years The Trump administration  over whether to send Trump to the DMZ amid concerns from the Moon administration and the State Department that such a visit could further inflame tensions with Pyongyang  The White House official said that Trumps personal security was not a concern in weighing a DMZ trip but that there is not enough time for the president to visit both Camp Humphreys and the outpost along the borderAsked if the White House was concerned whether avoiding the DMZ would compromise Trumps message to Pyongyang the senior administration official said Not really The message is that we are guests during a state visit of President Moon Jae-in Heinvited us to make the visit to Camp Humphreys I dont think this sends a message in a negative wayThe official who was not authorized by the White House to speak on the record made his remarks while providing an overview of Trumps Nov 3-14 trip to five Asian nations with a stop in HawaiiThe president will visit Japan South Korea China Vietnam and the Philippines in what will be his longest foreign trip to dateThe White House official confirmed that Trump will have bilateral meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Moon Chinese President Xi Jinping Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte While in South Korea Trump will deliver remarks to the South Korean National Assembly and visit the national cemetery to pay respects to fallen troops He also will deliver a speech at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Da Nang Vietnam to reaffirm the US commitment to a free and open Asia Pacific the administration official saidMuch of the presidents trip will focus on galvanizing international support for continued pressure on North Korea over its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs In Tokyo Trump will meet with the families of Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korea in the 1970sThe Trump administration and the United Nations have increased economic sanctions on Pyongyang including new authority for the Treasury Department to sanction international banks and companies that do business with the North The president has escalated his rhetoric saying during a UN speech last month that the United States is prepared to totally destroy the North if necessary and he has belittled dictator Kim Jong Un as Little Rocket Man  The White House official said that the United States has tried for 25 years to negotiate a good faith agreement with Pyongyang to rein in its nuclear ambitions and maintain productive diplomatic dialogueAt every turn the US has been cheated the world has been tricked the UN has been humiliated the official said This administration made a good-faith effort to signal to North Korea that our door was open to dialogue That olive branch was returned with roughly 20 ballistic missile tests including a couple launched over Japan ICBM tests the test of a large nuclear device the death of an American hostage two more hostages  there are now three in North Korea  and the assassination of a man [Kims half brother] at an international airport using a nerve agentThe official added If we fail to confront and deter the threat of North Korea well be living in a much darker era The presidentsrhetoric and more importantly his action led to the most substantial shift and progress within the international community in confronting this threatThe official declined to say whether the president would hold bilateral meetings with other foreign leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin who is scheduled to attend APECThe president also will focus on trade and economics during his trip Trump has pushed for a renegotiation of a US-South Korea trade deal signed by President Barack Obama in 2011 and he has offered mixed signals over Beijings economic policy at times accusing China of manipulating trade rulesTrump is frustrated by huge barriers of access to Chinese markets the White House official said The president is intent on redefining that situationMeanwhile news reports in Tokyo suggestthat Abe is preparing to play a round of golf with Trump The two played during Abes visit to Mar-a-Lago in the springI would not be surprised if they have an opportunity to play the White House official said Somebody probably me will be carrying [Trumps] golf bag on the airplaneShowing what would happen if your computers spell check became sentient and snarkily judgmentalwhoever runs

announce next week that he will decertify the international nuclear deal with Iran saying it is not in the national interest of the United States and kicking the issue to a reluctant Congress people briefed on the White House strategy said ThursdayThe move would mark the first step in a process that could eventually result in the resumption of US sanctions against Iran potentially derailing a deal limiting Irans nuclear activities reached in 2015 with the United States and five other nationsBut Trump would hold off on recommending that Congress reimpose sanctions which would constitute a clearer break from the pact according to four people familiar with aspects of the presidents thinkingThe decision would amount to a middle ground of sorts between Trump who has long wanted to withdraw from the agreement completely and many congressional leaders and senior diplomatic military and national security advisers who say the deal is worth preserving with changes if possibleThis week Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Gen Joseph F Dunford Jr the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff expressed qualified support for the deal during congressional testimony And Mattis suggested he did not believe taking the step to decertify would scuttle the agreementTrump is expected to deliver a speech tentatively scheduled for Oct12 laying out a larger strategy for confronting the nation he blames for terrorism and instability throughout the Middle EastOfficials cautioned that plans could still change and the White House would not confirm plans for a speech or its contents Trump faces an Oct15 deadline to report to Congress on whether Iran is complying with the agreement and whether he judges the deal to be in the US national security interestThe administration looks forward to sharing details of our Iran strategy at the appropriate time said Michael Anton spokesman for the White House National Security CouncilThe fate of the nuclear pact is only one consideration in that larger strategy US officials said although given Trumps focus on the deal as an embarrassment it is the most high-profile elementThe agreement signed under President Barack Obama was intended to close off the potential for Iran to quickly build a nuclear bomb by curbing nuclear activities the United States and other partners considered most troubling It allowed some uranium enrichment to continue for what Iran claims is peaceful medical research and energy the country says it has never sought nuclear weapons In exchange world powers lifted crippling US and international economic sanctionsAt issue now is the fate of US sanctions lifted by Obama and by extension whether the United States will move to break the deal That could open an international breach with European partners who have warned they will not follow suitOutreach for a transatlantic understanding about reopening or supplementing the deal is likely to be part of Trumps announcement according to one Iran analyst who has discussed the strategy with administration officials Several other people familiar with a nine-month review of US military diplomatic economic and intelligence policy toward Iran spoke on the condition of anonymity because aspects of the policy are not yet set and Trump has not announced his decisionTrump said last month that he had decided what to do on Iran but that he would not divulge the decision at that timeWelcoming military leaders to a White House dinner Thursday night Trump said Iran had not lived up to its end of the nuclear bargainThe Iranian regime supports terrorism and exports violence bloodshed and chaos across the Middle East he said That is why we must put an end to Irans continued aggression and nuclear ambitions They have not lived up to the spirit of their agreementThe presidents senior national security advisers agreed within the past several weeks to recommend that Trump decertify the agreement at the Oct15 deadline two of those people saidThe administration has begun discussing possible legislation to strengthen the agreement congressional aides and others said  a fix it or nix it approach suggested by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Sen Tom Cotton (Ark) a leading Republican hawk on IranBut the prospects of such an approach are highly uncertain and many supporters of the deal consider it a dodgeIranian President Hassan Rouhani said last month that he will not reopen the agreement for negotiation Separately representatives of Iran China and Russia told Secretary of State Rex Tillerson the same thing during a meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session last month two senior diplomats familiar with that meeting said  Cotton appeared to preview the main elements of the administrations plan this week although he said he does not know exactly what Trump plans to do The two met Thursday at the White HouseIn a speech Tuesday at the Council on Foreign Relations Cotton said Trump should decline to certify the deal and begin the work of strengthening itHe said decertification should be based on a finding that the deal is not in the US vital national security interest citing the long catalogue of the regimes crimes and perfidy against the United States as well as the deals inherent weaknessBut Cotton said he would not push for the immediate reimposition of sanctions as some conservative lawmakers and outside lobbying groups are doingHe laid out proposals for Congress to pass new stipulations for US participation in the deal including elimination of the sunset clauses under which restrictions on some Iranian nuclear activities expire after several years tougher inspections requirements and new curbs on Irans ballistic and cruise missile programsCotton claimed that a unified statement from Congress would help Trump forge a new agreement among European and other allies and strengthen his hand for renegotiationThe world needs to know were serious were willing to walk away and were willing to reimpose sanctions  and a lot more than that Cotton said And theyll know that when the president declines to certify the deal and not beforeIn the Senate plans have been underway for months to respond to a presidential decertificationSen Bob Corker (R-Tenn) chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee has been Capitol Hills point person on discussions with the White House Sen Benjamin L Cardin (D-Md) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) also have been made aware of plans being discussed with the White House and State DepartmentMcConnell is not eager to take on the issue at a time when the Senate calendar is full and midterm elections are only a year off according to congressional aides and a Western diplomat who has met with himHes not excited about getting the Old Maid said the diplomat referring to the card game where the player left holding a certain card is the loserStill Republican leaders say they are confident that they can craft a legislative response to the presidents decision that can address deficiencies in the deal and avoid turning the issue into a political litmus test for the GOPSome Republicans have also been urging the president to take a critical public stance against the deal  without blowing it upThe president should come out and say Hey were going to enforce this and right now I think these different provisions are being violated Sen Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) said last week adding that Trump should tell Iran it has a limited window to fix problems If they dont do what [then-Secretary of State] John Kerry and Barack Obama said they were going to do which is snap back sanctionsRep Adam B Schiff (D-Calif) said a decertification would undermine global confidence in the deal and in US commitments generallyIf the president fails to certify the deal while saying Iran is complying with it its a destructive political gesture Schiff said  Sen Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif) said that beginning a process that could result in the United States withdrawing from the Iran deal would go against advice from his own national security team and our closest alliesUnilaterally abandoning this agreement will make the world less safe she said in a statementA half-dozen Democrats who went to the White House on Wednesday evening to meet with national security adviser HR McMaster came away with the impression that he agreed with Mattis and DunfordThe group who visited with McMaster to discuss Iran included Cardin and Sens Robert Menendez (D-NJ) Christopher A Coons (D-Del) Joe Manchin III (D-WVa) Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) and Angus King (I-Maine) according to a person familiar with the meetingSen Cory Gardner (R-Colo) called the nuclear deal very very flawed but not completely ineffective  a common view among Republicans and a potential starting point for negotiations with DemocratsWhat we have to figure out is how to actually accomplish what we were well on our way to do before Barack Obama gave them a patient pathway to a nuclear bomb Gardner said referring to what he and other Republicans see as the deals failure to prevent Iran from developing weapons down the road Those concerns are one of the main areas that Republicans are planning to address in their legislative response to the presidents decision according to a person familiar with plans being hammered out between the White House State Department and Capitol Hill Abby Phillip and Ed OKeefe contributed to this reportPresident Trump has instructed advisers to prepare to withdraw the United States from a free-trade agreement with South Korea several people close to the process said a move that would stoke economic tensions with the US ally as both countries confront a crisis over North Koreas nuclear weapons programWithdrawing from the trade deal would back up Trumps promises to crack down on what he considers unfair trade competition from other countries but his top national security and economic advisers are pushing him to abandon the plan arguing it would hamper US economic growth and strain ties with an important ally Officials including national security adviser HR McMaster Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn oppose withdrawal said people familiar with the process who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal White House deliberationsAlthough it is still possible Trump could decide to stay in the agreement to renegotiate its terms the internal preparations for terminating the deal are far along and the formal withdrawal process could begin as soon as this week the people saidA White House spokeswoman said discussions are ongoing but we have no announcements at this timeRolling back free-trade agreements was a top priority of some of the senior members of the Trump administration who have left in recent weeks including former chief strategist Stephen K Bannon Bannon often found himself outmaneuvered internally by Cohn and others who aligned with business groups to warn of the economic consequences of withdrawing from trade deals but Trumps pursuit of terminating the South Korea deal appears to demonstrate the presidents personal commitment to reverse US policymakers long-standing pursuit of free tradeTrump has threatened before to withdraw from trade pacts only to pull back but his threat to South Korea comes as the two countries look to create a united front against North Korea at a time when military tensions are at their highest level in yearsAs if to underscore the point North Korea said Sunday that it haddeveloped a more advanced nuclear bomb with great destructive power releasing photos of Kim Jong Un inspecting what it said was a hydrogen bomb that could be attached to a missile capable of reaching the mainland United StatesAll the components of the H-bomb were homemade so North Korea could produce powerful nuclear weapons as many as it wants the state-run Korean Central News Agency quoted Kim as sayingNorth Koreas latest pronouncement could not be verified It claimed that a nuclear test in January last year was of a hydrogen bomb but experts said the seismic waves generated were consistent with an ordinary nuclear device not a thermonuclear oneThe US-South Korea deal which was reached in 2007 and went into effect in 2012 reduces trade barriers between the two countries Proponents say it gives US companies more access to the wealthy South Korean economy but critics charge that South Korea has reaped a greater share of the benefits of the deal an allegation Trump has personally echoed multiple times since his election while calling for changes to the dealSouth Korea elected a new president Moon Jae-in in May and Trump has been frustrated that Moon is not willing to accept the initial US trade demands several trade experts said Foreign leaders at first worked hard to build strong relations with Trump but there has been a marked change in recent months as numerous leaders have stood up to his brand of nationalismSouth Korean media have been telling trade representatives in Seoul to stand their ground against the United States in the renegotiationsThe North Korean nuclear crisis is pushing tension on this divided peninsula to new highs the Korea Times wrote in an editorial But that should be no reason for Seoul to put its economic interests far behind security matters weakening its bargaining leverage and playing into the hands of the US leader the self-styled artist of the dealTrump is playing with fire said Gary Schmitt co-director of the Marilyn Ware Center for Security Studies at the American Enterprise Institute There is a new president in South Korea whose instincts probably are to be probably not as pro-America as his predecessor and now you are putting him in a situation where he has to react In fact what you need now is as much cooperation as possibleWhite House advisers are trying to stop Trump from withdrawing from the South Korea free-trade agreement in part because they do not want to isolate the government in Seoul during a perilous time on the Korean Peninsula North Korea has become increasingly adversarial with its missile program testing nuclear weapons and firing missiles over Japan in a way that has alarmed the international communityWendy Cutler who was the chief US negotiator for the free-trade agreement said the prospect of canceling the deal could not come at a worse timeIf not handled carefully the latest impasse could lead to renewed trade tension between the US and Korea she wrote in the Hill this week It also takes place at a time after exceedingly threatening North Korean missile tests when the bilateral alliance could not be more importantSouth Korea is the sixth-largest goods trading partner with the United States accounting for $1122billion in two-way trade last year according to the US trade representative US companies exported $423billion in goods to South Korea and imported $699billion in goods last year leaving a trade deficit of $277billionTrump and Moon spoke on the phone late Friday but a readout of the call provided by the White House referenced only national security issues and did not mention the escalating trade disputeIf Trump withdraws from the agreement he could try to force South Korea to import more US products with little to no import restrictions something he believes will help US companies and workers South Korea could also decide to refuse any discussions with Trump kicking off a trade war between the countriesWithdrawing from the deal could lead to a large increase on tariffs levied against products the United States imports from South Korea such as electronics cellphones and automobiles South Korea would also immediately start charging very high tariffs on goods and services imported into its country Chad Bown who served as an economist in the White House during the Obama administration said the tariff the US government charges against many Korean imports would rise from 0to 35percent The tariff South Korea charges against US imports would rise from 0to almost 14percent making it harder for US companies to find buyers thereThe Pentagon referred a request for comment to the Commerce Department which did not respond Trumps consideration of starting the process to pull out of the deal was first reported by Inside US TradeIn July US Trade Representative Robert E Lighthizer revealed some of Trumps complaints with the South Korea deal during a special session that was called in an attempt by the White House to begin renegotiationsLighthizer said at the time that since 2012 the US trade deficit in goods with Korea has doubled from $132billion to $276billion while US goods exports have actually gone down This is quite different from what the previous Administration sold to the American people when it urged approval of this Agreement We can and must do betterSouth Korea though has so far refused to renegotiate the trade dealIn an April interview with The Washington Post Trump called the agreement With the Korean deal we terminate and its over Trump told The Post in that interviewTrump has expressed widespread frustration that he has not been able to follow through on campaign promises to rip up trade deals he argues have disadvantaged US workers He came close several months ago to starting a withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement but he stopped short after intense lobbying by advisers and the business communityBut in recent days he has said he might still withdraw from NAFTA accusing Mexico in particular of refraining to offer concessions during negotiationsTrump has said many countries that export more goods to the United States than they import are fleecing US workers and consumersThe US-South Korea free-trade agreement known as KORUS allows the United States to terminate it after six months if it wishes to So if Trump signed a letter to withdraw from the agreement the deal would effectively be terminated in March 2018 KORUS was approved by Congress but Trump could to pull out of the agreement on his ownNEW YORK  President Trump called on the United Nations to enact reforms to the world body pledging Monday in his debut here at the annual General Assembly meetings that he and his administration will be partners in your workSpeaking at the opening session of the four-day conference Trump said the organization founded in 1945 has not reached its full potential in recent years because of a bloated bureaucracy and mismanagementWe encourage all member states to look at ways to take bold stands at the United Nations with an eye toward changing business as usual and not being beholden to ways of the past which were not working Trump said flanked by UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Secretary General Antnio GuterresTrump had spoken dismissively of multilateral institutions including the United Nations and NATO during his campaign promoting an America first agenda aimed at reducing the United States interventionism abroad in favor of domestic prioritiesHis fellow leaders here at the annual gathering of more than 150 delegations are listening for signs of how closely Trump will align himself with the United Nations in the face of a series of international challenges including North Korea Syria and IranSpeaking briefly with reporters Trump riffed off of his campaign slogan Make America Great Again Trump said his main message is Make the United Nations great Not again Make the United Nations great Such tremendous potential and I think well be able to do thisIntroducing Trump Haley said the former business mogul is no stranger to change and added that he sees great potential not just in the reform among members but in the United Nations itselfAhead of the meetings Haley had lauded the United Nations for a pair of recent votes to enact severe economic sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs The sanctions seek to curtail oil imports to Kim Jong Uns regime and block exports from the countryThe White House said Trump spoke by phone with Chinese President Xi Jinping who is not attending the General Assembly to discuss North Koreas efforts to destabilize Northeast AsiaThe two leaders committed to maximizing pressure on North Korea through vigorous enforcement of United Nations Security Council resolutions according to the White House statementBut Trump has also voiced concerns that the United Nations and NATO have relied too heavily on

that was done for the purpose of entertainment Theres nobody that has more respect for women than I do he told the stationAre you trying to tone it down now asked the interviewer Jim SnyderIts not a question of trying its very easy Trump saidThe tape obtained by The Post seems to have captured Trump in a private moment with no audience beyond Bush and a few others on the bus It appears to have

criticized Senate Minority Leader Charles E Schumer (D-NY) as a culpritIn 1990 Schumer then a House member introduced the bill that helped create the visa program which passed Congress with a bipartisan majority and was signed into law by former president George HW Bush a Republican In 2013however Schumer was part of a bipartisan group of senators who sought to end the program as part of a comprehensive immigration reform packageIn a series of Wednesday morning tweets Trump sought to blame Schumer forthe attack and accused the Democratic leader of being too soft on immigration lawsThe

advantage  horrible advantage  of a tragedy and try to politicize and divide It doesnt work with New Yorkers it doesnt work with Americans  New York Gov Andrew M Cuomo(D) also took umbrage at what he described as Trumps attempts to politicize the attackThe presidents tweets Ithink were not helpful Cuomo said at a news briefing Wednesday morning I dontthink they were factual I thinkthey tended to

Cuomo and De Blasio to offer them the full support of the federal governmentfully supports any and all of their efforts with respect to the West Side attack  Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump)President Trump on Wednesday questioned why the United States should keep open the possibility of talks with North Korea hours after the US military conducted a new missile-defense test off the coast of Hawaii that it said was successfulThe test came after North Korea launched a ballistic missile over northern Japan early Tuesday and warned that it was the first step in having a Pacific operation Late in the day in Hawaii the Navy and the Missile Defense Agency combined to carry out what they termed a complex missile defense flight test intercepting a mock medium-range ballistic missile using guided missiles launched from the destroyer USS John Paul JonesThe military used what it calls Standard Missile-6 weapons to take out the ballistic missile target tracking it on radar aboard the ship first Lt Gen Sam Greaves director of the Missile Defense Agency said in a statement afterward that it was working with the Navy to develop this important new capability and considered the test a key milestone in building the Navys Aegis missile-defense capabilityWe will continue developing ballistic missile defense technologies to stay ahead of the threat as it evolves Greaves saidTrump accused North Korea of taking extortion money from the United States for the past 25 years in a tweet several hours later adding that Talking is not the answer The president posted the message as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was preparing to meet Wednesday morning with Song Young-moo South Koreas defense ministerThe US has been talking to North Korea and paying them extortion money for 25 years Talking is not the answer Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Mattis asked Wednesday morning at the Pentagon whether there are no diplomatic solutions when it comes to North Korea indicated that there still areNo were never out of diplomatic solutions he said We continue to work together and the minister and I share a responsibility to provide for the protection of our nations our populations and our interests which is what we are here to discuss todayThe test carried out off the coast of Hawaii marks the second time that the military has successfully intercepted a medium-range ballistic missile target military officials said The first one occurred in DecemberFollowing closed-door deliberations Tuesday the United Nations Security Council unanimously condemned the North Korean launch but stopped short of calling for additional sanctionsEnvoys from Japan and Britain backed additional penalties on Wednesday despite likely opposition from veto-holding powers China and Russia In the past the United States has worked with China to draft economic penalties that China which is responsible for about 90 percent of North Korean international commerce can support The latest and strictest penalties were imposed with a unanimous vote on Aug 5 but China has not signaled that it is prepared to go further nowBritish UN Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told reporters Wednesday that one potential target could be further restrictions on payments involving North Korean laborers employed abroadJapanese UN Ambassador Koro Bessho said Tokyo wants to follow up with a strong resolution and said the country would take up the issue of further sanctions with the United StatesNavy Adm Harry Harris chief of Pacific Command has suggested that the Pentagon should consider adding more ballistic missile interceptors in Hawaii citing the threat North Korea poses There are sufficient ballistic missile interceptors protecting the United States at Fort Greely in Alaska and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California he said but more equipment in Hawaii could be helpfulI believe that our ballistic missile architecture is sufficient to protect Hawaii today but it can be overwhelmed Harris said in April during a House Armed Services Committee hearing If the United States faced a wave of incoming ballistic missiles he added someone would have to make a decision on which one to take out or not So thats a difficult decisionNEW YORK  President Trump lashed back Friday at North Koreas leader calling Kim Jong Un a madman whose regime will be tested like never before amidnew US-imposed financial sanctionsThe latest economic pressures announced Thursday come as the Trumpadministration seeks to build international support for more aggressively confronting the rogue nation whose escalating nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities have reached what US officials consider a crisis pointThe new penalties seek to leverage the dominance of the US financial system by forcing nations foreign companies and individuals to choose whether to do business with the United States or the comparatively tiny economy of North Korea US officials acknowledged that like other sanctions these may not deter North Korean leader Kim Jong Uns drive to threaten the United States with a nuclear weapon but are aimed at slowing him downKim on Thursday reacted angrily to Trumps remarks and actions this week calling the presidenta mentally deranged US dotard and Trumps earlier speech at the UNunprecedented rude nonsenseKim said he was now thinking hard about how to respond  I will make the man holding the prerogative of the supreme command in the US pay dearly for his speech Kim said in a statement released by the official Korean Central News Agency which also published a photo of the North Korean leader sitting at his desk holding a piece of paperI am now thinking hard about what response he could have expected when he allowed such eccentric words to trip off his tongue Whatever Trump might have expected he will face results beyond his expectation Kim said adding that he would tame Trump with fireIn his latest tweeted barb Friday Trump called Kim a madman who brings famine and death on North KoreansKim Jong Un of North Korea who is obviously a madman who doesnt mind starving or killing his people will be tested like never before Trump wroteSouth Koreas Yonhap News Agency reported Thursday night that the Norths foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said in New York that his country may test a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean to fulfill Kims vow to take the highest-level action against the United States It could be the most powerful detonation of an H-bomb in the Pacific Ri said We have no idea about what actions could be taken as it will be ordered by leader Kim Jong Un US officials believe the North carried out its first hydrogen bomb test underground on Sept 3Trumpsexecutive order grants the Treasury Department additional authority that Trump said would helpcut off international trade and financing that Kims dictatorship uses to support its banned weapons programsNorth Koreas nuclear program is a grave threat to peace and security in our world and it is unacceptable that others financially support this criminal rogue regime Trump said in brief public remarks during a meeting with theleaders of South Korea and Japan to discuss strategy to confront PyongyangHe added that the United States continues to seek a complete denuclearization of North KoreaSignificantly Trumpalso said that Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered Chinese banks to cease conducting business with North Korean entities Trump praised Xi calling the move very bold and somewhat unexpectedChina is North Koreas chief ally and economic lifeline Some 90 percent of North Korean economic activity involves China and Chinese entities are the main avenue for North Koreas very limited financial transactions in the global economy China is also suspected of turning a blind eye to some of the smuggling and sanctions-busting operations that have allowed Pyongyang to rapidly develop sophisticated long-range missiles despite international prohibitions on parts and technologyAll UN sanctions have to be acceptable to China which holds veto power in the UN Security Council Chinas recent willingness to punish its fellow communist state signals strong disapproval of North Koreas international provocations but China and fellow Security Council member Russia have also opposed some of the toughest economic measures that could be applied such as banking restrictions that would affect Chinese and other financial institutionsWe continue to call on all responsible nations to enforce and implement sanctions Trump said  Trump has sought to rally international support for confronting Pyongyang during four days of meetings here at the UN General Assembly In a speech to the world body Tuesday Trump threatened to totally destroy the North if necessary and referred derisively to Kim as Rocket Man But the president and his aides have emphasized that they are continuing to do what they can to put economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea to avoid a military conflictWe dont want war UN Ambassador Nikki Haley told reporters At the same time were not going to run scared If for any reason North Korea attacks the United States or our allies were going to respond[]The new executive order signals US willingness to take a more aggressive approach to cutting off world trade with North Korea even if other countries such as China arent willing partners in sanctions because it would allow the United States to economically punish businesses anywhere in the worldThe executive order opens the door for the US to unilaterally enforce a trade embargo against North Korea said Joseph DeThomas a former State Department official who focused on North Korea and Iran and is now a professor of international affairs at Pennsylvania State University It gives us the power to play that game if we wish toIn the past Chinese officials have objected to suggestions that the United States could punish foreign companies trading with North Korea but there are signs that Chinaand the United States are becoming more agreeable on North KoreaThe positive comments about China when [Trump] made the announcement indicate that theres some good cooperation rather than confrontation DeThomas saidDeThomas warned however that even if sanctions are adopted and enforced the way ahead will be difficult because North Korea may feel it has little choice given the presidents bellicosity at the United Nations but to proceed with its weapons program despite the pain of an embargoIf we stick with sanctions its going to be a long ugly haul with lots of humanitarian costs DeThomas saidA White House fact sheet said that under the executive order airplanes or ships that have visited North Korea will be banned for 180 days from visiting the United States a move to crack down on illicit tradeThis significantly expands Treasurys authority to target those who enable this regime  wherever they are located Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saidUS officials say there is still time and room for diplomacy if North Korea shows that talking could be productive Other countries including China and Russia are pressing Washington to make a greater effort toward talks and an eventual bargain that could buy Kim out of his weapons without toppling his regimeThe shape of a possible deal has been evident for years but Kim has raised the stakes and perhaps the price with his rapid development toward the capability to launch a nuclear-equipped intercontinental ballistic missile at US territoryAsked why North Korea might entertain such an international deal when Trump appears poised to undermine a similar one with Iran Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said a North Korea deal would be designed very differentlyWhile the threat is the same  its nuclear weapons  the issues surrounding North Korea are very different than the issues surrounding Iran Tillerson said Wednesday Iran is a large nation 60 million people North Korea is a smaller nation the hermit kingdom living in isolation Very different set of circumstances that would be the context and also the contours of an agreement with North Korea many aspects of which dont apply between the twoIn recent weeks the Security Council has approved two rounds of economic sanctions but also left room for further penalties For example the sanctions put limits on the nations oil imports but did not impose a full embargo as the United States has suggested it supports The Trump administration has signaled it also wants a full ban on the practice of sending North Korean workers abroad for payments that largely go to the government in PyongyangWe are witnessing a very dangerous confrontation spiral Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in a speech to the United Nations filling in for President Vladimir Putin who skipped the forum Weresolutely condemn the nuclear missile adventures of Pyongyang in violation of Security Council resolutions But military hysteria is not just an impasse its disaster There is no alternative to political and diplomatic ways of settling the nuclear situation on the Korean PeninsulaMnuchin emphasized that this action is in no way specifically directed at China and he said he called Chinese officials to inform them ahead of the US announcementMnuchin also said the unilateral US action is nota rejection of separate Security Council sanctions and the international diplomacy they require Similar to unilateral US sanctions on Iran applied during the Obama administration the new US restrictions seek to leverage the power of the US financial systemForeign financial institutions are now on notice that going forward they can choose to do business with the United States or with North Korea but not both Mnuchin saidSitting down with South Korean President Moon Jae-in before the trilateral discussion with Japan Trump said the nations are making a lot of progressMoon praised Trumps speech to the United Nations saying through an interpreter that North Korea has continued to make provocations and this is extremely deplorable and this has angered both me and our people but the US has responded firmly and in a very good way  The Security Council had also applied tough new export penalties in August and Tillerson said Wednesday there are signs that those restrictions are having an economic effectWe have some indications that there are beginning to appear evidence of fuel shortages Tillerson said in a briefing for reporters And look we knew that these sanctions were going to take some time to be felt because we knew the North Koreans  had basically stockpiled a lot of inventory early in the year when they saw the new administration coming in in anticipation of things perhaps changing So I think what were seeing is a combined effect of these inventories are now being exhausted and the supply coming in has been reducedThere is no sign however that economic penalties are having any effect on the behavior of the Kim regime and its calculation that nuclear tests and other provocations will ensure its protection or raise the price of any eventual settlement with the United States and other nations  Trump said the United States had been working on the North Korea problem for 25 years but he asserted that previous administrations had done nothing which is why we are in the problem we are in todayBRANCHBURG NJ  President Trump signaled Sunday that he does not believe that attempts at direct communications with North Korea are worth the effort despite escalating tensions between Washington and PyongyangA day after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson suggested that the United States maintains lines of communications with Kim Jong Uns regime Trump wrote on Twitter that Tillerson is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man  his nickname for KimSave your energy Rex well do what has to be done Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) The president has taken an increasingly hard-line stance toward Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile tests threatening ina speech to the UNGeneral Assembly two weeks ago to totally destroy North Korea if necessaryTillerson on a visit to Beijing told reporters Saturday that the State Department is  through direct channels with the North whether Kim would be open to talks and under what conditionsWe ask Would you like to talk We have lines of communications to Pyongyang Were not in a dark situation a blackout We have a couple three channels open to Pyongyang we can talk to them we do talk to them Tillerson saidStay tuned he addedTrump who is spending the weekend at his Bedminster golf resort in New Jersey has said repeatedly that he is open to military options North Korean officials have suggested that Trumps threats amount to a declaration of warLater Sunday Trump said he would succeed where his predecessors had not but he noted that US diplomacy with Kim has failed over 25 years Kim is 33 and only came to power after his father Kim Jong Il died in December 2011Being nice to Rocket Man hasnt worked in 25 years why would it work now Clinton failed Bush failed and Obama failed I wont fail Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump)FBI Director James B Comey asked the Justice Department this weekend to issue a statement refuting President Trumps claim that President Barack Obama ordered a wiretap of Trumps phones before the election according to US officials but the department did not do soComey made the request Saturday after Trump accused Obama on Twitter of having his  wires tapped in Trump TowerThe White House expanded on Trumps comments Sunday with a call for a congressional probe of his allegationsThe revelation  underscores the fraught nature of the FBIs high-profile investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election A key question fueling that inquiry is whether Trump associates colluded with Russian officials to help Trump winNeither Justice nor the FBI would comment SundayThe development came as Trumps charge against Obama  leveled without any evidence  was being rebuffed both inside and outside of the executive branch It drewa blunt on-the-record denial by a top intelligence official who served in the Obama administrationSpeaking on NBC News on Sunday morning former director of national intelligence James R Clapper Jr denied that a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) wiretap was authorized against Trump or the campaign during his tenureThere was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president-elect at the time as a candidate or against his campaign Clapper adding that he would absolutely have been informed if the FBI had received a FISA warrant against eitherI can deny it Clapper said emphaticallyIn his claims early Saturday morning the president tweeted that he just found out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower before the election Trump compared the alleged action to McCarthyismIs it legal for a sitting President to be wire tapping a race for president prior to an election Trump asked in another tweet Turned down by court earlier A NEW LOWBy Sunday morning the White House doubled downon Trumps explosive tweet stormand calledfor the congressional probe  Current and former government officials said such surveillancewould not have been approved by any senior Justice official in the Obama administration And Trumps allegation raised hackles in the FBI leadership implying as it did that the bureau may have acted illegally to wiretap a presidential candidate without probable cause that he was an agent of a foreign power as the foreign intelligence surveillance law requiresThis is Nixon/Watergate Trump tweeted SaturdayA spokesman for Obama countered several hours later that the former president never authorized a wiretap ofTrump or any other American citizenAny suggestion otherwise is simply false the spokesman saidWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer on Sunday cited reports of potentially politically motivated investigations during the 2016 campaign calling them troubling But none of the media reports cited by the White House provides evidence of a politically motivated surveillance effort against TrumpPresident Donald J Trump is requesting that as part of their  the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016 Spicer saidNeither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is conducted the statement addedCongressional committees in both the House and the Senate are probing not just suspected Russian efforts to undermine the 2016 election but any contacts between Russian officials and the Trump campaignComeys request is sure to raise eyebrows in light of his actions last year in the bureaus investigation into Hillary Clintons email serverInJuly he held a news conference  without telling the Justice Department what he would say  to announce that the bureau had concluded Clinton did not commit a prosecutable offense Then 11 days before the election Comey wrote Congress despite warnings from senior Justice officials that doing so would violate department policy and said the FBI was examining new emails that had come to light Nothing came of the bureaus additional review but Comey took heat for his actions which Democrats say influenced the outcome of the electionIt is not clear why Comey who is the senior-most law enforcement officer who has been overseeing the FBI investigation from its inception in the Obama administration did not himself issue a statement to refute Trumps claims Nor is it clear to whom he made his request Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself last week from all investigative matters related to the Trump campaign and any potential Russia links The acting deputy attorney general Dana Boente a career federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia is now overseeing the probeTrumps tweets early Saturdaymay have been prompted by the comments of a which were summarized in an article on the conservative website Breitbart The Breitbart story on Friday  The White Houses escalation of Trumps claims were kept at arms length by congressional Republicans appearing on Sunday morning news broadcastsWhen asked about Trumps allegations Senate Intelligence Committee member Tom Cotton (R-Ark) declined to comment on the tweets but said he has seen no evidence of the allegationsWhether thats a FISA court application or denial of that application or a re-submission of that application that doesnt mean that none of these things happened It just means we havent seen that yet Cotton added speaking on Fox News SundaySen Marco Rubio (R-Fla) saidhe is not aware of evidence to back up the presidents claim I have no insight into exactly what hes referring to heThe president put that out there and now the White House will have to answer for exactly what he was referring toObamas allies were more blunt denying flatly that the former president had ordered a wiretap ofTrumps campaignThis may come as a surprise to the current occupant of the Oval Office but the president of the United States does not have the authority to unilaterally order the wiretapping of American citizens said former Obama White House press secretary Josh Earnest Senate Minority Leader Charles E Schumer (D-NY) told Meet the Press that Trump is in trouble and acting beneath the dignity of the presidencyThe presidents in trouble if he falsely spread this kind of information Schumer said It shows this president doesnt know how to conduct himselfEarnest added that Trump was attempting to distract from the controversy involving contacts between his campaign aides including now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Russian officialsWe know exactly why president Trump tweeted what he tweeted Earnest added Because there is one page in the Trump White House crisis management playbook and that is simply to tweet or say something outrageous to distract from a scandal And the bigger the scandal the more outrageous the tweet  But appearing on ABCs This Week White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders repeatedly said that the presidents allegation was worth looking intoHes asking that we get down to the bottom of this lets get the truth here lets find out Huckabee Sanders said I think the bigger story isnt who reported it but is it true And I think the American people have a right to know if this happened because if it did again this is the largest abuse of power that I think we have ever seenAsked whether Trump truly believes Obama wiretapped him Huckabee Sanders deflectedI would say that his tweet speaks for itself there she saidClappers comments referred only to whether Trump campaign officials had been wiretapped But their conversations could also have been captured by routine surveillance of Russian diplomats or intelligence operativesUS monitoring of Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak for example caught his conversations with Trump adviser Michael Flynn during the campaign Flynn went on to becomeTrumps national security adviser but he was forced to resign last month after admitting that he had misled other senior Trump officials about the nature of those conversationsThe FBI and the National Security Agency also have obtained intercepted communications among Russians officials in which they refer to conversations with members of the Trump team current and former US officials have saidOn the broader question of apparent Russian interference in the 2016 election Clapper urged congressional investigators to attempt to settle the issue which he said has become a distraction in the political sphereThe intelligence community found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government  at least until the end of the Obama administration he said SundayWe had no evidence of such collusion he said on Meet the Press But Clapperadded a caveat This could have unfolded or become available in the time since I left governmentWhether there was any collusion is a key question fueling a wide-ranging federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaignOn Jan 6 the US spy agencies collectively released a report concluding that Russia carried out cyberhacks and other active measures with an intent to help Trump and harm the campaign and potential presidency of Hillary Clinton The report Clapper pointed out included no evidence of collusion with the Trump campaignBut the investigation by the FBI the NSA and the CIA continues The Senate and House intelligence committees also are conducting investigationsPresident Trump moved quickly Wednesday to gain political advantage in the wake of the New York terrorist attack casting blame on Democrats for lax immigration laws and calling the criminal justice systems handling of suspects a jokeA day after a man identified by authorities as an Uzbek immigrant  on a Manhattan bike path in an act authorities said was inspired by the Islamic State Trump seized on the deadly crime to renew his calls for a series of hard-line policies The president said he would move to eliminate a popular diversity lottery for foreigners seeking US visas and direct the State Department to ramp up extreme vetting of immigrants He also suggested he would consider sending the suspect Sayfullo Saipov a legal permanent resident of the United States to the US military prison in Guantanamo Bay CubaWe have to get much tougher Trump saidWe have to get much smarter And we have to get much less politically correct Were so politically correct that were afraid to do anythingTrump campaigned on vows to get tougher on terrorism and immigration but his agenda has been largely stalled in Congress and in the federal courts where judges have blocked several attempts by the administration to enact a sweeping travel ban on immigrants from a handful of countries although Uzbekistan is not one of themIt was not clear how much action Trump could take on his own to make good on his renewed pledgesBut his response  including blaming Senate Minority Leader Charles E Schumer (D-NY) for helping create the visa program that allowed Saipov to enter the country  stood in sharp contrast to the White Houses reaction to the mass shooting in Las Vegas last month that killed 59 people at a country music concertAfter that attack by a Nevada man who killed himself Trump denounced the shooters act as pure evil but White House aides and Republican allies rejected calls by Democrats for a renewed debate over gun-control laws saying it was not appropriate to politicize the tragedyOn Wednesday however Trump said the United States needs a system of punishment thats far quicker and far greater than the punishment these animals are getting right now Theyll go through court for years  We need quick justice and we need strong justiceTrump also said the criminal justice system is a laughingstock in how suspects are prosecuted and added that keeping the country safe will require unflinching devotion to our law enforcement homeland security and intelligence professionalsThe comments are remarkable given the Justice Departments heavy focus on prosecuting terrorism casesJust two weeks ago a federal jury  born in Afghanistan for detonating explosives in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York last year  Referring to Saipov as an animal Trump asserted that the 29-year-old was responsible for the entry of 23 immigrants many of them family members The president said such chain migration endangers national security and he called for the elimination of  through which authorities have said Saipov came to the United States in 2010It was not clear what evidence the president had for the claim legal permanent residents are permitted to sponsor only their spouse and their children under 21 years of age for green cards according to US Citizenship and Immigration ServicesThe lottery program issues up to 50000 visas per year to people from dozens of countries granting them legal permanent residency The aim is to mix up the nations melting pot although the visas are a tiny fraction of the roughly 1million green cards issued annuallyIts not good It hasnt been good Weve been against it Trump saidHe has expressed support for an immigration bill from Republican Sens Tom Cotton (Ark) and David Perdue (Ga) that would slash legal immigration levels by half over a decade including eliminating the diversity lottery Democrats and many Republicans have opposed the billThis man that came in or whatever you want to call him brought in with him other people and he was the primary point of contact for  and this is preliminarily  23 people that came in or potentially came in with him Trump said Thats not acceptableAsked whether Saipovs family members represent a security threat Trump replied They certainly could He did They certainly could represent a threatIn 1990 Schumer then a House member introduced the bill that helped create the diversity visa program which passed Congress with a bipartisan majority and was signed into law by President George HW Bush a RepublicanIn 2013 however Schumer was part of a bipartisan group of senators that sought to end the program as part of a comprehensive immigration reform package that later died in the Republican-controlled HouseSchumer denounced Trumps remarks and pointed to President George W Bushs response to the Sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks in which he attempted to rally the nation to find a common approach to confront the threatAll President Trump does is take advantage  horrible advantage  of a tragedy and try to politicize and divide Schumer saidThis is a tragedy Its less than a day after it occurred and he cant refrain from his nasty divisive habitsAt the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders rejected the notion that Trump had politicized the attack saying that the president has consistently spoken about the need for tougher immigration laws  This is something that frankly the president has been talking about for a long time Sanders saidThis isnt a new policy This isnt a new position This isnt a new conversationThe clash once again pitted the two New Yorkers against each other over an attack that played out miles from where they grew upIt also raised questions about whether the fallout could further complicate the already tenuous path for Congress to find a compromise on legislation to legalize hundreds of thousands of younger undocumented immigrants known as dreamers They were thrust into limbo in September after Trump announced the termination of a deferred deportation program created by President Barack Obama that allowed them to live and work in the United StatesI have always believed in immigration as good for America  so do the vast majority of Americans I stand by that today Schumer saidIts a good thing for America Whether President Trump believes that or not we dont know because some days hes very anti-immigrant and then he calls [House Minority] Leader [Nancy] Pelosi and I to the White House and says Lets help the dreamersOther New York Democrats also took umbrage at Trumps response to the attacksGov Andrew M Cuomo said the presidents tweets against Schumer and the immigration system were intended to point fingers and politicize the situationSuch tactics play into the hands of the terrorists to the extent you disrupt and divide and frighten people in this society Cuomo saidSanders said Trump spoke on the phone with Cuomo and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D)A summary of the call from deBlasios office said the president praised the efforts of the first responders and offered federal assistance in the investigation while the mayor thanked Trump for the help from homeland security officialsThe two did not have much else to talk about however The call the mayors office said lasted approximately five minutes Philip Rucker and Sean Sullivan contributed to this reportEarly in his administration President Trump signed a directive outlining a strategy of pressure against North Korea that involved actions across a broad spectrum of government agencies and led to the use of military cyber-capabilities according to US officialsAs part of the campaign US Cyber Command targeted hackers in North Koreas military spy agency the Reconnaissance General Bureau by barraging their computer servers with traffic that choked off Internet accessTrumps directive a senior administration official said also included instructions to diplomats and officials to bring up North Korea in virtually every conversation with foreign interlocutors and urge them to sever all ties with Pyongyang Those conversations have had significant success particularly in recent weeks as North Korea has tested another nuclear weapon and ballistic missiles officials said  So pervasive is the diplomatic campaign that some governments have found themselves scrambling to find any ties with North Korea When Vice President Pence called on one country to break relations during a recent overseas visit officials there reminded him that they never had relations with Pyongyang Pence then told them to their own surprise that they had $2million in trade with North Korea Foreign officials who asked that their country not be identified described the exchangeThe directive also instructed the Treasury Department to outline an escalating set of sanctions against North Korean entities and individuals and foreigners who dealt with them Those instructions are reflected in a steady stream of US and international sanctions in recent monthsThe directive was not made public at the time it was signed following a policy review in March because we were providing every opportunity as a new administration to North Korea to sit down and talk to take a different approach said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss closed-door policy decisionsWe made clear the door was open for talks before the president had even signed off on this strategy but North Korea continued to launch missiles continued to kidnap Americans to keep as hostages  all the things they did when we were early in the administration and sending signals that the door was open to talksThat door remains open Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Saturday in Beijing Speaking to reporters following talks with Chinese officials Tillerson for the first time acknowledged that the United States was in direct communication with North KoreaWe are probing so stay tuned he said We ask Would you like to talk We have lines of communications to Pyongyang Were not in a dark situation a blackout We have a couple three channels open  We can talk to them we do talk to them  In Washington however officials quickly played down any idea that negotiations were underway or that anything had yet come of the talks State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert issued a statement saying that North Korean officials have shown no indication that they are interested in or are ready for talks regarding denuclearizationThe senior administration official said it would be wrong to read too much into Tillersons remarks The US has always maintained some kind of channel kept some channel open even in the darkest days of previous administrationsThose channels include conversations between the State Departments special representative for North Korea Joseph Yun and Pak Song Il a senior member of Pyongyangs delegation to the United Nations They have met several times this year to discuss American prisoners being held by North Korea among other matters Other contacts have taken place through the track two process which regularly brings together nongovernmental US experts  and occasionally US officials  and North Korean officialsTillersons remarks Saturday came after a day of meetings with top Chinese officials including President Xi Jinping which saw both sides strike a careful conciliatory tone following a new North Korean nuclear test and missile launches and weeks of insults and threats between Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong UnIn brief formal statements before their meetings Chinese leaders  who have repeatedly called for restraint  did not mention North Korea Instead they tried to keep the focus on Trumps upcoming Asia visit which Xi promised would be a special wonderful and successful eventThe Cyber Command operation which was due to end Saturday was part of the overall campaign set in motion many months ago The effects were temporary and not destructive officials said Nonetheless some North Korean hackers griped that lack of access to the Internet was interfering with their work according to another US official who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a secret operationCyber Command and the White House had no comment But the senior administration official said What I can tell you is that North Korea has itself been guilty of cyberattacks and we are going to take appropriate measures to defend our networks and systemsEric Rosenbach who led the Pentagons cyber-efforts as assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration said the operation could have the advantage of signaling to the North Koreans a more aggressive posture However theres accompanying risk of an escalation and a North Korean cyber-counterattackRosenbach now co-director of the Belfer Center at the Harvard Kennedy School said that he was not aware of the actual operation but that if it is truly a military operation he sees no reason to hide it The Department of Defense should probably own it he saidAaron Hughes a former senior cyber-official in the Obama administration said he too was not aware of the actual operation But if I was still in my [Pentagon] seat I would actively be advocating we do these types of things  We should be using all elements of national power to deter and message the North Koreans to include our military including cyber Hughes saidOthers said they would be cautious about using even minor cyber-capabilities against North Korea and doing it openly because of the risk of retaliationI wonder what the disruptive payoff is that were getting thats worth even a marginal extra chance of nuclear war said Jason Healey a former military cyber-operator and now a senior research scholar at Columbia Universitys School of International and Public Affairs Rauhala reported from BeijingPresident Trump attacked anotherfellow Republican on Friday tauntingSen Bob Corker (R-Tenn) after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman last weekpublicly questioned the presidents stability and competenceTrump saidFriday morning on Twitter Strange statement by Bob Corker considering that he is constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in 18 Tennessee not happyStrange statement by Bob Corker considering that he is constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in 18 Tennessee not happy Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Trumps attack on Corker comes as the Republican National Committee is convening in the senators home state of Tennessee for its summer meeting One of Trumps sons Eric addressed the Nashville gathering on Thursday nightCorker becomes the fifth GOP senator this month alone to draw the presidents ire On Thursday Trump attacked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) over his management of the health-care bill as well as the looming showdown over raising the federal governments debt limit At a Tuesday night rally in Phoenix Trump went after  though not by name  Arizonas US senators John McCain and Jeff Flake both Republicans And last week Trump  Sen Lindsey O Graham (R-SC) a longtime Trump punching bag  Corker is well-regarded within the Republican establishment and was a dutiful supporter of Trump during last years campaign trying to educate the political novice-turned-presidential nominee on foreign policy and even introducing him at a rally Trump in turn considered Corker as a possible vice-presidential running mate and secretary of stateBut their relationship began to rupturelast week Following Trumps wavering and widely denounced responsesto the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville Corker criticized the presidents leadershipThe president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful Corker toldreporters in Tennessee And we need for him to be successful  Corkers comments drew considerable media attention but for a full week Trump resisted respondingWhen White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was  Thursday about Corkers statement she said I think thats a ridiculous and outrageous claim and doesnt dignify a response from this podiumCorkers comments may not have dignified a response from the briefing room podium on Thursday but they evidently did dignify a response from the presidential Twitter handle as Trump on Friday issued his rebuke to Corker on social mediaPresident Trump thanked China on Tuesday for help reining in North Korea as his administration moved to punish banking entities in China and elsewhere that have allegedly helped the rogue regime in Pyongyang get around a punishing yoke of economic sanctionsI applaud China for breaking off all banking relationships with North Korea something that people would have thought unthinkable even two months ago Trump said I want to thank President Xi he said referring toChinese President Xi JinpingChinese banks and other financial entities have been a lifeline for the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un andalthough China has cut many ties and helped impose international sanctions US officials say cracks remainJust before Trump spoke in the Rose Garden theTreasury Department announced new sanctions on eight North Korean banks and 26 people in China and three other countries that the Trump administration says are linked to North Korean financial networksNorth Korean nuclear weapons and missile development threaten the entire world with unthinkable loss of life Trump said All nations must act now to ensure the regimes complete denuclearization  The rhetoric was mild in comparison with Trumps vow last week to totally destroy North Korea if necessary and his derisive reference to Kim as Rocket ManKim in turn had called Trump deranged and possibly senile and the North Korean foreign minister said Monday that Trumps words amounted to a declaration of war  The Trump administration says its policy of international pressure is starting to work The goal is to persuade Kim to give up the nuclear weapons he claims he needs to ensure his security against a US attack China is the linchpinas Beijing is both North Koreas main economic partner and its traditional protectorThe State Department announced Tuesday that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will visit China next week to discuss North Korea as well as to plan for Trumps visit to China later this yearThe United States has led a pressure campaign to get other nations to stop doing even minimal trade or banking business with North Korea and to cut or downgrade diplomatic relations with Pyongyang Those efforts are on top of tighter economic penalties imposed at the United Nations over the last two monthsI appreciate the United Nations Security Council voting twice unanimously  15 to nothing twice  to adopt hard-hitting resolutions against North Korea Trump said Tuesday I have recently issued tough new sanctions against those who do business with this outlaw regime And I applaud Chinas latest action to restrict its trade with North KoreaThe new measures announced Tuesday advance our strategy to fully isolate North Korea in order to achieve our broader objectives of a peaceful and denuclearized Korean Peninsula Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saidin a statementPresident Trump on Tuesday will present a vision of US engagement with the world in a maiden address to the United Nations that aides said will be consistent with the nations values and traditions but will not focus on advancing democracy abroadThis dichotomy of a US leader pledging to shape global conditions to ensure Americas prosperity and security without explicitly promoting its way of life is expected to distinguish  from those of his White House forebears The presidents  has led to widespread anxiety among the US allies and partners who have gathered here this week among the more than 150 foreign delegations at the 72nd UN General Assembly Amid mounting global challenges foreign leaders are carefully watching Trumps moment on the world stage for signals about his willingness to maintain the United States traditional leadership roleAlthough Trump campaigned on a policy of putting America first and spoke dismissively of international bodies such as the United Nations and NATO he has offered a tentative embrace of them as he seeks to rally international support to confront destabilizing threats from North Korea Iran and the Islamic State Trump began several days of diplomacy at the United Nations with a session Monday devoted to reforming the institution  a theme during his outsider presidential campaign and a key demand of some of his conservative supporters The focus on reducing bureaucracy lent a critical tone to Trumps debut In brief opening remarks he said the United Nations had not lived up to its billing upon its creation in 1945 asserting that it suffered from a bloated bureaucracy and mismanagement Trump urged his fellow leaders to make reforms aimed at changing business as usual but pledged that his administration would be partners in your work Make the United Nations great the president told reporters when asked about his message this week riffing off his campaign slogan Not again Make the United Nations great Such tremendous potential and I think well be able to do thisWhite House aides said the address would be consistent with Trumps foreign policy speeches this year in Riyadh Saudi Arabia where he challenged other nations to do more in the global fight against terrorism and in Warsaw where he warned that Western civilization was under attack President Barack Obama used his final UN address last year to urge his peers to continue to embrace the multilateral cooperation that had marked the post-World War II era and to warn of a global retreat into tribalism and building walls  an implicit reference to Trump just weeks before the 2016 presidential election Trump campaigned on a pledge to build a wall on the US-Mexico border and to curtail immigration In the vast UN chambers Trump will give a clear-eyed view of the challenges facing the international community and offer a path that is based on outcomes not ideology said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the presidents speechTrump as he has before intends to emphasize the need for other nations to take up more of the burden of providing for their own prosperity and security rather than relying on the United States Its a shared risk the administration official said Nations cannot be bystanders to history The aide added that Trump will talk about the need to work toward common goals But he will not tell them how to live He will not tell them what system of government to have He will ask countries to respect the sovereignty of other nations Thats the rationale for the basis of cooperationForeign leaders have sought to influence Trump this week on a range of issues Trumps first meeting with a world leader here was with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a choice meant to underscore the US commitment to Israel and displeasure at what US officials see as systemic anti-Israel bias at the United Nations It was also a nod to the open question of US participation in the UN-backed nuclear deal with Iran  one of the most pressing issues hanging over the session this year Netanyahu who will also address the gathering Tuesday opposes the international deal and lobbied hard against it during the Obama administration When we look at the agreement we have reservations Israels UN ambassador Danny Danon said in an interview We should not be the one who will tell our allies what to do and how to do but we have some hand-on experienceTrump whose administration faces an Oct 15 deadline to certify whether Tehran has complied with the agreement said last week that Iran had violated the spirit of the deal by supporting terrorism in the Middle East A statement that Iran is not complying would set off a congressional review of whether to reimpose some US sanctions which could sunder the dealThe president believes the deal is deeply flawed said Brian Hook a State Department official who accompanied Trump in his meetings with foreign leaders Monday Trump told his foreign counterparts what he thinks are the shortcomings Hook saidIranian President Hassan Rouhani who will address the United Nations on Wednesday told CNN that a US withdrawal would harm American credibilityExiting such an agreement would carry a high cost Rouhani saidThe White House said Trump spoke by phone Monday with Chinese President Xi Jinping who is not attending the UN meetings to discuss North Koreas efforts to destabilize Northeast Asia with its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles Ahead of the meetings UN Ambassador Nikki Haley lauded the United Nations for a pair of recent votes to enact severe economic sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs The sanctions seek to cut off oil imports to the regime of Kim Jong Un  who   and block exports from the countryIn another bilateral session Monday French President Emmanuel Macron pressed Trump to keep the United States in the Paris climate accord Trump who told him the deal imposed oppressive regulatory burdens on American businesses has vowed to withdraw the United States from the agreement at the earliest opportunity in 2020 There is a worrying degradation of the world environment French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said at a news conference Without mentioning Trump by name Le Drian lamented an increasing breakdown of international cooperation and withdrawal out of fear or selfishnessYet as Trump sat down with Macron he reflected fondly on his official trip to Paris in July to watch  down the Champs-Elysees This the president ruminated would be an import from abroad that has his supportIt was a tremendous thing Trump said And to a large extent because of what I witnessed we may do something like that on July Fourth in Washington down Pennsylvania Avenue  Were going to have to try and top itPresident Trump will visit five countries in Asia from Nov 3-14 on a marathon trip that will be largely focused on his efforts to confront North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programsTrumps itinerary features a swing through the major powers in Northeast Asia  Japan South Korea and China  whose leaders he has met with several times already in a bid to develop a strategy to increase pressure on Pyongyang The president also will participate in regional economic and security conferences in Vietnam and the Philippines the White House announced FridayAmong the leaders Trump could meet during his trip is Russian President Vladimir Putin who is also expected to attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Da Nang Vietnam Trump also will hold bilateral meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-inIt is not clear whether Trump intends to hold bilateral meetings with Vietnamese leaders or Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte who is hosting the Association of Southeast Asian Nations conference in Manila Duterte has come under international criticism for his administrations brutal crackdown on drug trafficking which has resulted in thousands of extrajudicial killings  Trump praised Dutertes drug war in during which the American president sought to enlist his counterpart to lobby China to put more pressure on North KoreaTrumps engagements will strengthen the international resolve to confront the North Korean threat and ensure the complete verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula the White House said in a statement announcing the tripTrump announced last week that he had signed an executive action giving the Treasury Department greater authority to sanction foreign businesses and individuals that conduct trade with North Korea an effort to cut off funding that Kim Jong Uns regime could use for its weapons programs That move followed Trumps speech at the United Nations General Assembly in which he threatened to the North if necessary and referred derisively to Kim as the rocket man  Kim lambasted Trump in a rare direct address and Pyongyang said the presidents speech amounted to a declaration of war a charge the White House rejectedOn his trip Trump also is expected to focus on economics and trade He has said his administration intends to attempt to renegotiate a bilateral trade deal with South Korea that was signed by President Barack Obama in 2011South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha called that trade deal the economic tool that locks in a peaceful prosperous future together during an appearance at the Center for Strategic and International Studies this weekPresident Trump waded deeper Thursday into the legal procedures ahead for thesuspectin the New York City terrorist attack saying he wishes he could ship him off to Guantanamo Bay and urging for the death penaltyThe series of tweets which began shortly after midnight staked out a White House position well ahead of the courts It also sharply broke with long-held traditions of senior public officials holding back comments that could appear to undermine the legal process and possibly complicate proceedingsIn an early morning tweet Trump wrote that he would love to send the suspect Sayfullo Saipov to the military-run detention site at Guantnamo but lamented it might take longer than going through the Federal system Trump also repeated his call for Saipov to face capital punishmentWould love to send the NYC terrorist to Guantnamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the Federal system Trump wroteThere is also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed Trump added moments later Should move fast DEATH PENALTYThere is also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed Should move fast DEATH PENALTY Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Hours earlier Trump expressed outrage at reports that Saipov asked for the Islamic State flag to be hung in the hospital room where he was treated for gunshot wounds during his capture by police after Tuesdays rampageNYC terrorist was happy as he asked to hang ISIS flag in his hospital room He killed 8 people badly injured 12 SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY Trump wroteHis tweet deviated from an unwritten rule that presidents shouldnt express themselves on the outcome of pending criminal cases Public comments that someone is guilty or should be punished in a certain way can and do play into the hands of defense lawyers if and when cases go to trialThe lawyers for Bowe Bergdahl who deserted his base in Afghanistan in 2009 argued unsuccessfully that candidate-Trumps comment  would taint any trial While a military judge said Trumps comments were disturbing he did not feel it necessary to dismiss the case Bergdahl ultimately pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencingNYC terrorist was happy as he asked to hang ISIS flag

Uzbek immigrant drove arented truck into people walking and cycling on a New York City bike path federal authorities claim Authorities charged Saipov withproviding support to a terrorist organization alleging the Islamic State inspired him to carry out the attackIn court papers federal authorities said that Sayfullo Saipov told the FBI that he began planning his attack a year ago though he settled on using a truck as a weapon only two months prior The Washington Post The tweet was one of many from Trump since the attack in New YorkAfter the attack Trump wrote several tweets calling for tougher vetting processes of immigrants in particular calling for an end to the State Department program known as the Diversity Visa Lottery In several of these he tweeted at the Fox News show Fox & FriendsThe United States will be immediately implementing much tougher Extreme Vetting Procedures The safety of our citizens comes first Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration no more Democrat Lottery Systems We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter)  Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) He alsoattacked Senate Minority Leader Charles E Schumer (D-NY)who in 1990 introduced the House bill that helped create the visa program in an open effort to associate Schumer with the attackTrump comments came as North Korea spurned a new round of sanctions approved by the United Nations Security Council and pledged to continue to press forward with development of nuclear weapons that could reach the US mainland  Appearing at an event at his Bedminster NJ golf club where Trump is on a 17-day working vacation he said that North Korea best not make any more threats to the United StatesThey will be met with fire and fury and frankly power the likes of which this world has never seen before Trump saidas his administration faces one of its most serious foreign policy challenges of his presidencySpeaking of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un Trump said he has been very threatening beyond a normal stateThe Washington Post on Tuesday reported that North Korea has that can fit inside its missiles crossing a key threshold on the path to becoming a full-fledged nuclear power according to a confidential assessment by US intelligence officialsTrumps warning Tuesday further raisesthe stakes for the US president and other world leaders who face limited options in dealing with North Koreas aggression Trump suggested progress is being made with the cooperation of China and Russia both of which supported the Security Councilresolution offered by the United States over the weekendAfter many years of failure countries are coming together to finally address the dangers posed by North Korea Trump said We must be tough & decisiveThere was no sign at a major Asian security conference in Manila that the sanctions hailed by Trump as a foreign policy achievement would succeed where past efforts have failed in trying to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weaponsNorth Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told diplomats that his country will never negotiate away what he called a rational strategic option against the threat of attack from the United StatesWe will under no circumstances put the nukes and ballistic rockets up for negotiation he said in prepared remarks adding that the entire United States is within range of its missilesRidismissed the UN sanctions approved Saturday as illegal appearing to rule out talks that the Trump administration in a diplomatic partnership with China and Russia is offering North Korea as a way out of its economic and diplomatic pariah statusThe US assessment about North Koreas progress in producing a miniaturized nuclear warhead are likely to deepen concerns about an evolving North Korean military threat that appears to be advancing far more rapidly than many experts had predictedUS officials last month concluded that Pyongyang is also outpacing expectations in its effort to build an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking cities on the American mainlandWhile more than a decade has passed since North Koreas first nuclear detonation many analysts believed it would be years before the countrys weapons scientists could design a compact warhead that could be delivered by missile to distant targets But the new assessment a summary document dated July 28 concludes that this critical milestone already has been reachedTrumps comments Tuesday came at an event focused on the countrys opioid crisis After he finished opening remarks on that subject he was asked by a reporter about North Korea Trump sat back in his seat arms folded and looked straight into the cameras as he made his commentsSouth Koreas trade community is on the defensive after President Trumps renewed call to terminate a free-trade agreement with the country which many experts here see as a puzzling move during an inopportune time of heightened tensions over North Koreas nuclear and missile programEarlier this month Trump to prepare to withdraw from the agreement also known as Korus He seemed to be making good on a threat he had floated when he claimed that the deal now in its fifth year was horrible and left America destroyedThe man who negotiated the free-trade agreement or FTA for South Korea vigorously disputes that and argues that the timing couldnt be worse South Korea has been an adamant ally to the United States for the last 70 years Now North Korea is provoking and China is expanding their power flexing muscles said Choi Seok-young We dont quite understand what is the main purpose of Mr Trump attacking Korea by terminating Korea-US FTA at this critical timeHis American counterpart in the negotiations Wendy Cutler warns that a US pullout from the agreement would probably drive South Korea into a closer economic relationship with ChinaThe White House has not made a formal announcement on terminating the deal In fact days after reports surfaced of Trumps move to withdraw US Trade Representative Robert E Lighthizer contradicted Trump telling reporters that the administration wants to renegotiate the deal and make some amendments insteadThe uncertainty may be why at least in part the administration of South Korean President Moon Jae-inhas not yet publicly responded to Trumps latest threatSince Trumps election officials here have stressed that the agreement while not perfect is designed to be mutually beneficial Trumps consistent criticism of the deal has left South Korean trade officials and experts rejecting his characterization of it as a US job killer and instead highlighting gains that the United States has made in the Korean market sometimes to the detriment of Korean workersThe US argument to renegotiate the Korus FTA is very difficult to understand from the Korean perspective Choi saidHe called it a revolutionary moveThat makes me wonder How can we trust the United States They pushed it very strongly 10years ago he said and after a while they come back to abolish it Its a matter of trust and this kind of attitude does not help in strengthening alliesThe agreement was negotiated and signed under President George W Bush It was ratified by Congress in 2011 and took effect in 2012It wasnt universally acclaimed in South KoreaBoth in 2008 when the agreement was signed and in 2011 when Congress ratified it there was strong opposition here to the deal There were daily demonstrations by Korean workers particularly farmers who opposed increased US beef imports In 2011 an opposition leaderset off tear gas on the parliament floor in protestSince 2012 Korus has produced mixed results for the United States The US merchandise trade deficit with South Korea more than doubled which is the basis of Trumps rejection of the deal even though economists generally agree that trade imbalances are a result of broader macroeconomic factors and not simply because of bilateral trade of goods and servicesOverall Korea accounts for only 25 percent of the 2017 US trade deficit in goods and servicesThe trade growth on both sides has been slower than initially anticipatedSome major US industries have benefited South Korean experts note that the increase in imports of cheap high-quality US agriculture and dairy products has hurt Korean agricultural workersThe US service surplus with Korea increased under Korus So far in 2017US merchandise exports to Korea have seen a sharp increase compared with 2016 while US imports from Korea have been flat at the Peterson Institute for International EconomicsThe South Korean government-funded Korea Institute for International Economic Policy says that if Korus was terminated the United States would lose its advantage in auto manufacturing agriculture and service sectors in KoreaThe research institute estimated that if the United States withdrew from the deal its exports would drop 2 percent while US imports would drop 43 percentKorus removed car tariffs in 2016 allowing rapid growth of US car exports to Korea Imports have been taking a larger share of the Korean car market over the past five years and since 2012 the sale of US-made cars in Korea increased by almost 90 percent according to SchottThis isnt helping the Korean car market which already is struggling to compete with European and Japanese imports said Kim Jong-bum an international trade law professor at Yonsei University Graduate School of International Studies For example Hyundai is facing more competition in the Korean market because the markets are open to the EU and US cars And they are very high-quality cars Kim said But its not been all bad as the Korean auto market also has benefited from exports to the United States he said Government data released this week showed that Korean auto exports to North America and Europe rose sharply in AugustIf the United States abolishes the trade agreement its major trading partners such as the European Union and Canada would enjoy duty-free access said Cutler while American goods might face an average 14 percent tariffOur companies and farmers would quickly lose the important inroads that they have made in the Korean market said Cutler who is vice president of the Asia Society Policy InstituteCutler said 2016 was a record year for Korean investment in the United States which has resulted in tens of thousands of high-paying US jobs Its hard to believe that this trend would continue without KorusPresident Trump threatened to terminate the US trade agreement with South Korea in an interview Thursday night declaring that the five-year-old accord with a key ally was a horrible deal that has left America destroyedDuring an Oval Office  about trade policy in North America Trump served notice that he is looking to disrupt an important partnership in the tumultuous Asia-Pacific region as well  even with Seoul  because of North Koreas escalating military provocationsTrump sharply criticized the US-Korea Free Trade Agreement known as Korus which was negotiated and signed during the George W Bush administration The latest version was ratified by Congress in2011 and took effect in March 2012 during the Obama administrationIts a horrible deal It was a Hillary Clinton disaster a deal that shouldve never been made Trump said referring to the then-secretary of state who became the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Its a one-way streetSouth Korea is the United States sixth-largest goods trading partner and the US goods trade deficit with the country was $277billion last year  to the Office of the US Trade  Representative  Next week marks an anniversary for Korus and triggers a review period to potentially renegotiate or ratify a new version of theagreementWeve told them that well either terminate or negotiate Trump said We may terminateThe president said that the process of termination of Korus is simpler than with the North American Free Trade AgreementWith NAFTA we terminate tomorrow if we did it ends in six months he said With the Korean deal we terminate and itsoverTrump added I will do that unless we make a fair deal Were getting destroyed in KoreaSouth Koreas Trade Ministry said Friday that it has no plans to renegotiate the agreement the Associated Press reported The countrys vice trade minister said South Korea was not notified of any trade renegotiationOn his trip to Asia last week Vice President Pence  to an audience of business leaders in Seoul that the United States was looking to reform the Korus agreement because US businesses face too many barriers to entry which tilts the playing field against American workers and American growthTrumps threat to South Korea comes after he withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact The Trump administration also is pushing to renegotiate trade relationships with Japan another important allyDuring a visit last week to Tokyo to open an economic dialogue with the

but one president since Ronald Reagan have gazed across the barren strip of land at the 38th parallel from an observation post where theyve been moved to talk tough In April Vice President Pence undertaking the same solemn ritual said he  so the North Koreans could see our resolve in my faceBut as President Trump prepares for  to bolster international pressure on Pyongyang the administration is divided over whether he should make the pilgrimage an issue that remains unresolved Some aides worry a visit could further inflame  on the Korean Peninsula while others have expressed concern over Trumps personal safety according to people who have spoken to administration officialsAsian foreign policy veterans of both the Obama and George W Bush administrations said it would be foolish for Trump not to go But the White House is facing opposition from South Korean President Moon Jae-ins administration and the US State Department over fears that a visit would ratchet up Trumps war of words with North Korean dictator Kim Jong UnA White House spokesman declined to comment saying the administration was not ready to release the full itinerary for Trumps trip which is scheduled to last from Nov 3 to Nov 14 Asked during a news conference this week whether a DMZ visit would provoke Pyongyang Trump said the trips details were not finalized and added I didnt hear in terms of provoking but we will certainly take a look at thatTrump has already done plenty of provoking amid reports that North Koreas ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs are making more-rapid advances than expected Trump has repeatedly mocked Kim as Little Rocket Man and he declared during  last month that the United States is prepared to totally destroy the North if necessaryKim has responded with his own harsh rhetoric by calling Trump and by threatening to strike Guam and test a nuclear device over the Pacific OceanTrump will have plenty of other chances to talk tough starting with a tour of the Pearl Harbor military base in Hawaii on his way to Asia In Tokyo the president is scheduled to meet with the parents of a Japanese girl  four decades ago and in Seoul he will deliver a speech to the South Korean National Assembly But current and former US officials said a presidential visit to the DMZ sends a more pointed message to the American and South Korean troops who patrol the border region just 30 miles north of Seoul  as well as the enemy forces on the other side  that the United States remains committed to the bilateral defense treaty that has been in place since the armistice that halted fighting in the Korean War in 1953The DMZ functions as a kind of amplifier said Daniel Russel who served as assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs under President Barack Obama and is now a senior fellow at the Asia Society The message takes on a more martial and ominous tone when it comes out of a military command post on North Koreas doorstepGeorge HW Bush is the only president since Reagan toured the DMZ in 1983 not to visit although Bush did make his own trip while serving as Reagans vice president Obama  during a 2012 trip to Seoul for a nuclear summit telling the troops that the contrast between South Korea and North Korea could not be clearer could not be starker both in terms of freedom but also in terms of prosperity In 1993 President Bill Clinton told reporters  that if the North ever used nuclear weapons it would be the end of their country Clinton walked so far across the Bridge of No Return that joins the two Koreas that US Secret Service agents reportedly  to protect him in violation of the Korean War cease-fire Officials in Seoul and Tokyo are eager for Trump to reaffirm his commitment to the US defense treaties with the East Asian allies The president has unsettled Moon and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe by criticizing US trade imbalances with those nations pulling out of a 12-nation Asia-Pacific trade accord and demanding a renegotiation of a bilateral trade pact with South Korea that Obama signed in 2011At the same time Moons advisers fear that a Trump visit to the DMZ could increase the chances of a miscalculation that could provoke a military confrontation or have other unintended consequences such as harming Asian financial markets or disrupting planning for the Winter Olympics which will be held in February in PyeongChang South KoreaEvan Medeiros who served as senior Asia director at the National Security Council under Obama said Trump needs to be crystal clear on the US position on North Korea and suggested that the costs of not visiting the DMZ could be greater than going If he doesnt go guess what the next story is said Medeiros who accompanied Vice President Joe Biden to the DMZ in 2013 Already some foreign policy experts are mocking the White Houses hesitation On Tuesday Jeffrey Lewis a nuclear nonproliferation expert who operates a popular Twitter account  with his retweet of a South Korean news report that US and South Korean officials were steering Trump away from the DMZ Former US officials emphasized that Trumps national security team could craft a visit that achieves the symbolic message  speaking to the troops touring Observation Post Ouellette  without directly provoking the North with hostile words But they acknowledged that the president who would be accompanied by reporters is prone to straying off messageWeve never had a president go to the DMZ who has implied the US is preparing for preventative war with North Korea said Michael Green who served as senior Asia director at the NSC under President George W BushIn February 2002 Bush visited the DMZ less than a month after he had called North Korea Iran and Iraq the axis of evil during his State of the Union address The presidents speechwriters proposed having Bush deliver remarks akin to Reagans seminal tear down this wall speech in West Berlin in 1987 But Green said Bushs team eventually came to conclude that such a moment could be misinterpreted as a provocative call for regime change in Pyongyang Instead they sent him  near the border to call on the North to open an uncompleted railway between the two countriesLike the United States South Korea has become a beacon of freedom showing to the world the power of human liberty to bring down walls and uplift lives said Bush who also visited the DMZ observation post Today across the mines and barbed wire that light shines brighter than ever It shines not as a threat to the North but as an invitationOn Friday President Trump departs on his first foreign trip Over the course of nine days hell meet many leaders face-to-face for the first time including key NATO leadersBefore leaving office Vice President Joe Biden articulated the central importance of  Asked about the  he  for incoming administrations [I]t all gets down to the conduct of foreign policy being personal  I think its vitally important that not only you know and have as hard of a read as you can get on the foreign leader with whom youre dealing friend or foe but that leaders know that what you say what you do what you propose is real  During his campaign Trump also stressed the virtues of   and the importance of cultivating personal relationships As the crisis with North Korea deepened in recent weeks Trump even suggested that he  to meet personally with Kim Jong Un to resolve their differences  What do we know about the effectiveness of face-to-face diplomacy Here are four insights from recent research in this fieldOne of the biggest challenges in foreign policy is figuring out the intentions of other countries especially those who possess the military capabilities to harm your state This is the classic  in international politics  when fear and mistrust lead to avoidable conflict Leaders diplomats and policymakers  that there is no substitute for sitting down with a friend or adversary to gauge their intentionsAs superpower relations deteriorated in the early 1980s the specter of nuclear confrontation led  to believe that if we were ever going to break down the barriers of mistrust that divided our countries we had to begin by establishing a personal relationship between the leaders of the two most powerful nations on EarthReagans opportunity came in November 1985 with a face-to-face meeting in Geneva with the new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev Reagan recalled that as he shook hands with Gorbachev for the first time and  that a breakthrough might be possible Reagan read Gorbachevs intentions accurately and the Geneva summit was the pivotal first step toward the end of the Cold WarLong before the advent of easy air travel leaders devoted considerable efforts to engage in such personalized diplomacy  suggest reasons these   argues that leaders use face-to-face interactions to gain information and  about the sincerity of other state leaders that is difficult to ascertain through other means Leaders draw on vivid indicators such as facial expressions body language and other expressive behaviors to infer the other partys true intent  These expressive behaviors can serve as what Robert Jervis called  signals that bring with them inherent credibility because of their virtually uncontrollable nature These offer  into what sociologist  where our true intentions lieEmpathy can also help leaders perceive each other as sincere When we are face-to-face with someone Marcus Holmes argues we put ourselves in their position simulating in our own minds the sincere intentions of others This type of empathy leads to a better understanding of where the other person is coming from in terms of their positions and interests  and how they are approaching a particular issueAll of this can pay  In the 1978 Camp David talks for instance Jimmy Carter mediated a  between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin Carters capacity to empathize with each of the protagonists through his individual face-to-face meetings with them enabled the two bitter foes to move toward a zone of agreement they could not see previouslyOf course meeting in person also gives other leaders an opportunity to read you Having this two-way street can be desirable particularly if the goal is reassuring an adversary Reagan believed that if he could only get in a room with Mikhail Gorbachev the Soviet leader would believe that US intentions were peacefulNaturally theres reason for caution if leaders are trying to shield their true intentions from each other Face-to-face interactions might yield  that come from expressions and visual cues more than from the words spoken between parties  Four years after the initial Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Geneva President George HW Bush went to Malta to negotiate for the reunification of Germany Bush read from Gorbachevs demeanor that he was  and used this information in part to push for a reunified Germany under NATO By some accounts others within the Soviet leadership regretted allowing Bush to form this impression and the failure of the Soviet leader to provide a more definitive answer on the German questionClearer signals can   for example says that face-to-face interactions allow leaders and policymakers to gauge each others trustworthiness and that such encounters can lead to a bond of trust developing that ensures the accurate interpretation of signals that are sincerely aimed at communicating peaceful intentBiden is not the first policymaker to argue that foreign policy is personal Trump seems to agree and has an ambitious itinerary for his first foreign trip These interpersonal relations are an opportunity for Trump and other leaders signal to each other that they can be trusted  and they mean what they sayBut it remains to be seen what this first trips meetings will bring In the wake of last weeks apparent  in a meeting with Russian policymakers foreign leaders may be wary of Trumps unpredictability and potentially his untrustworthiness This overseas trip offers Trump an important chance to bolster his credibility demonstrate his sincerity and to start building trust face-to-faceAs the White House was engulfed by a crisis of its own making  the abrupt firing of the FBI director  President Trump received an unlikely visitor Henry Kissinger the Republican Partys leading elder statesman who came to deliver a tutorial on foreign affairs last Wednesday ahead of the presidents first overseas tripKissinger was not alone In the days leading up to Trumps high-risk debut on the world stage  a nine-day five-stop four-nation tour  the Oval Office has morphed into a graduate seminar room with a rotating roster of policy experts briefing the presidentOr that was the original planAs frequently is the case around Trump distractions were everywhere His tte--tte with Kissinger briefly turned into a photo opportunity with the former secretary of state sitting by silently as Trump made his first public comments on his dismissal of James B Comey from the FBIDespite the maelstrom  and the presidents personal obsession with the Comey saga  Trump still made time to start preparing for a trip that could become a resounding triumph or go horribly awry with just one mistakeOn foreign soil Trump will have to navigate diplomatic land mines  from negotiating peace between the Israelis and Palestinians to reassuring jittery European allies to following protocol in greeting Pope FrancisHes going to be in the spotlight under the microscope and for a lot of people in the world this will be a chance to see him in action said Richard N Haass president of the Council on Foreign Relations In part because the expectations are modest he can more than meet them If the trip is simply normal then its a successTrumps advisers say the president understands the stakes and is taking his preparation seriously His team deliberately scaled back his public schedule in the two weeks leading up to his planned Friday departure even though much of his time last week was eaten up by the Comey drama and talks about shaking up his West Wing staffTrumps carefully choreographed trip begins in Saudi Arabia where he will meet with Muslim partners from across the Arab world and beyond to seek alliances in combating Islamic State terrorists From there he heads to Israel to underscore the United States commitment to Israel and the Jewish people He also will meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud AbbasTrump then travels to Rome where he is scheduled meet the pontiff and discuss religious freedom and human rights issues Trump will attend a summit of NATO leaders in Brussels followed by a meeting of the Group of Seven nations in SicilyNational security adviser HR McMaster previewing the trip to reporters last Friday said it has three core purposes First to reaffirm Americas global leadership Second to continue building key relationships with world leaders And third to broadcast a message of unity to Americas friends and to the faithful of three of the worlds greatest religionsThe trip say outside foreign policy gurus has other benefits for Trump as well Unlike in the United States it is doubtful that Trump will directly encounter protesters in Saudi Arabia because the kingdoms strict laws restrict public dissent in Israel because he enjoys a warm relationship with the government and at the summits in Belgium and Italy because security measures will create a wide perimeter around him most of the timeAnything could mar the trip however whether a verbal gaffe breach of protocol or even wayward body language Extensive preparation said foreign policy experts may be especially valuable for a leader such as Trump whose temperament favors the cocoon of familiarity He also can be visibly uncomfortable when ceding the spotlight to others or when sitting through lengthy meetings in which other speakers have the floor  hallmarks of foreign summitsThis might be the first foreign trip where the president will tweet from abroad said Lanhee Chen a fellow at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institution who served as Mitt Romneys chief policy adviser during his 2012 presidential campaign How do we deal with that There are certain conventions and precedents we adhere to when on foreign soil Is this a dictum the president will maintainIn recent days Trump has received a series of briefers who present information as he likes to consume it  in free-flowing conversations in video presentations and in photographs maps and charts as opposed to voluminous reading materialsThe process largely is being overseen by Jared Kushner the presidents son-in-law and a senior adviser as well as McMaster and deputy national security adviser Dina PowellSecretary of State Rex Tillerson Defense Secretary Jim Mattis Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller have spent time preparing the president while key lawmakers  including Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn) and its ranking Democrat Sen Benjamin L Cardin (Md)  have offered input as well though not directly to TrumpTrump is soliciting counsel from some outsiders such as Kissinger but has largely kept his circle confined to real-world practitioners and administration insiders  a reflection of the White Houses view that input from academic experts authors and other thought leaders is less valuable because they have not achieved practical successTop White House officials are sensitive to the portrayal of Trump as a know-nothing novice when it comes to foreign policy pointing out that he has traveled the globe many times as a real estate mogul with properties on several continentsAnd they say Trump has already weathered foreign policy challenges from the confines of the White House Indeed most developments seen by many as early successes have been in this realm the bombing in Syria attempts to warm relations with China and efforts to strengthen alliances against North KoreaSenior advisers also insist that Trumps preparation has not been limited to the days leading up to his trip Since his election the president has used the hours he has spent with foreign leaders over working lunches and one-on-one meetings  as well as his 76 phone calls with 43 global counterparts according to the White Houses tally  as tutorials on the economic and security challenges across different regionsThe sessions said a senior White House official break down along distinct lines First what deliverables the president hopes to achieve from the trip and second the strategic messaging of those goals Trump has been working closely with Miller known for his nationalist and anti-globalist views to help sketch out his prepared remarksTrump met recently with Tillerson in the Oval Office to discuss the Saudi Arabia visit and set goals for his meetings with Arab leaders He also sat down with Mattis who briefed him on his recent trip to the Middle East and on security concerns in the regionCohn Kushner and Powell also met with the president last week including an hour spent discussing the G-7 portion of the trip And last Wednesday and Thursday McMaster Kushner and Powell briefed Trump on the feedback they received from their own meetings withkey senatorsAdvisers said Trump intends to draw a deliberate contrast with former president Barack Obama whose speeches overseas championing human rights and democracy sometimes rankled his hosts Senior officials said the president did not plan tolecture orchastiseOne challenge for Trump will be to adapt the language he uses domestically  epitomized by the America First theme of his inaugural address  into more inviting and inclusive rhetoric for US allies and potential allies said Richard Burt a top diplomat in the Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush administrationsI dont think that America First is the kind of theme you want to take with you when you go abroad Burt said Youve got to somehow modify it to show that America First does not mean that our friends and allies are not important in our overall policyDonald Trump was the mainstream face of a fringe movement five years ago that questioned Barack Obamas place of birth and qualifications for office eventually prompting the president to release a long-form certificate proving his birth in HawaiiTrump has never apologized recanted his charges or even admitted error Instead he tries not to discuss itI dont talk about it because if I talk about that your whole thing will be about that Trump told reporters aboard his plane on Labor Day So I dont talk about itThis is a persistent pattern for the stubbornly unapologetic Republican nominee Judging by his own words the Republican nominee apparently still believes that prisoners of war such as Sen John McCain (R-Ariz) are not heroes that a federal judge of Mexican heritage is unable to fairly rule in a civil case involving Trump University that the Muslim American father of a fallen soldier has no right to question him that former president George W Bush should be blamed for the 9/11 terrorist attacks that foreign Muslims must be barred from entering the country until officials figure out what is going on and that the father of Sen Ted Cruz (R-Tex) might have been involved in the murder of President John F Kennedy  The approach has often allowed Trump to dodge responsibility for attacks part of an attempt to portray himself as a more moderate candidate in the general election But it has also provided a stream of material for Hillary Clinton and her Democratic allies as they compose attack ads One released this summer showed small children observing some of Trumps most offensive comments including when he mocked a disabled reporter while another released this week featured veterans listening to Trump insult McCain and claim to have sacrificed for his countryThe Trump campaign declined to answer a written series of questions about where the candidate now stands on a long list of positions or insults Instead campaign spokesman Jason Miller pointed to a blanket expression of regret that Trump made last month and then provided a list of controversies that he believes Clinton should explainWhen Hillary Clinton chooses incorrectly there are real world ramifications presenting a troubling pattern that questions whether or not shes even qualified to be President of the United States Miller wrote in an emailThe Clinton campaign has been trying to hold Trump to his most definitive positions  a task that can be difficult Clinton deputy communications director Christina Reynolds said that on a variety of issues Trumps imprecision or his failure to address certain topics are attempts to have it both waysHe was birther for years and years and years and now he doesnt talk about it Reynolds said Tuesday If he doesnt believe it anymore he should say soEven when Trump seems to regret some of the things that he has said done or tweeted  like when he retweeted an unflattering photo of Cruzs wife questioned former rival Ben Carsons religion or used the word bimbo in a tweet about Fox Newss Megyn Kelly  he will stop short of the genuine apology that is common in American politics Last summer Trump said he couldnt remember if he had ever asked God for forgiveness and in September said that apologizings a great thing but you have to be wrongTrump seemed to come close to acknowledging the potential for error when he said at a rally in Charlotte last month that sometimes during the heat of debate he will choose the wrong words or say the wrong thing And believe it or not I regret it Trump said And I do regret it particularly where it may have caused personal painBut when pressed since then to explain what he regrets Trump and his top aides have declined to provide examples  He has said that he wants to regret anytime hes caused somebody personal pain by saying something that he didnt intend to cause personal pain and I think those who have received it privately should take that expression of regret Trumps campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on ABC News last month At another point she said Hes expressed his regret publicly and said if I have caused you personal pain  that can include me that can include you  that he regrets thatDuring an interview with Fox Newss Sean Hannity that aired on Aug 24 Trump reiterated that he does regret things but did not provide any examples and said that he doesnt regret calling Cruz Lyin Ted or Clinton Crooked Hillary Then he changed the topic to the tremendous success of his tremendous campaignTrump began to build his current political brand in 2011 by questioning Obamas qualifications for office Trump never came out and said where he thinks the president was born but he demanded to see the presidents full birth certificate and other documents forcing the fringe issue into the mainstream In April of that year Obama released his long-form Hawaiian birth certificate in the name of putting all of the conspiracy theories to rest and Trump congratulated himself Today I am very proud of myself because I have accomplished something that nobody else has been able to accomplish Trump said at the time I was just informed while on the helicopter that our president has finally released a birth certificate  He should have done it a long time agoBut Trump didnt let the issue go In June 2015 CNNs Anderson Cooper asked Trump whether he now believes Obama was born in the United States and Trump didnt clearly answer   No I dont know I really dont know Trump said I mean I dont know why he wouldnt release his records But you know honestly I dont want to get in itOn the campaign trail Trump has repeatedly suggested that the president might not be Christian or that he might sympathize with Islamic State terroristsSuch attacks have caused many black voters to turn sharply against Trump offended that he would challenge the qualifications of the countrys first black president As Trump has made an aggressive pitch to minority voters in the past few weeks there has been a renewed debate over Trumps prominent role in the birther momentOn Tuesday Carson  now a regular Trump surrogate  said on CNN that Trump could immediately improve his relationship with African American voters by apologizing for questioning the presidents place of birth I think that would be a good idea absolutely Carson said I suggest that on all sides Aaron Blake and Anne Gearan contributed to this reportTwo days in a row in prepared speeches Trump asserted that that his rival Clinton lacks mental and physical stamina to do the job as presidentThats surely no accident but a campaign official did not respond to a query about why the GOP presidential nominee was making this claim We assume Trumps rhetoric is related to a not-so-quiet campaign among right-leaning news entities to highlight concerns about Clintons health often shared on social media with #HillarysHealthOur colleague David Weigel has already taken  at the smorgasbord of junk science being used to promote such claims But now that Trump has raised the issue himself we thought it would be a valuable service to collect all of the claims in one place  and assess whether any hold waterFirst we should note that both candidates have released summary letters attesting to their health Neither has met the standard set by Sen John McCain (R-Ariz) when he ran for president in 2008 at the age of 71 McCain  to view 1173 pages of medical documentsClinton who would be 69 on inauguration day in July 2015 released  from Dr Lisa Bardack an internist in Mount Kisco NY who has served as her doctor for 15 years The eight-paragraph letter described Clinton as a healthy 67-year-old female whose current medical conditions include hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergiesThe letter disclosed that Clintonsuffered from deep vein thrombosis in 1998 and in 2009 an elbow fracture in 2009 and most notably a concussion in 2012 (The elbow injury and concussion when she was secretary of state were extensively reported at the time) The letter says her concussion symptoms including double vision were resolved within two months The letter concluded that Clinton is in excellent physical condition and fit to serve as president of the United StatesTrump who would be 70 on inauguration day in December 2015 released a  from Dr Harold N Bornstein a gastroenterologist in New York Bornstein said he had treated Trump for 36 years The letter written with Trumpian rhetoric proclaimed that if elected Mr Trump I can state unequivocally will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency It provided few specifics  Trump apparently takes a statin drug and baby aspirin each day  and somemedical professionals have noted it was oddly worded for an official document released by a medical doctor(For example see this interestingabout Bornsteins letter by Dr Jennifer Gunter an OB/GYN in San Francisco Gunter noted in an Aug 16 blog post that the letter referred to a PSA test score and that Trumps medical examination showed only positive results  often a bad thing in medical parlance The letter even foreshadows Trumps complaint about Clinton saying Trumps physical strength and stamina are extraordinary)Now here are the various allegations about Clinton  and what the evidence shows  suddenly emerged Aug 8 via a Twitter account titled  that was quickly deleted The documents allegedly showed the devastating results of two office visits to Bardack in 2014 Snopescom which debunks Internet rumors  the alleged records were forgeries After all the documents even got the doctors title wrongOn Aug 16 Bardack in a statement released by the Clinton campaign affirmed the alleged records are false were not written by me and are not based on any medical facts She reiterated that Clinton is in excellent health Fox News host Sean Hannity has devoted a number of shows to concerns about Clintons health in particular a June 10 clip of Clinton rapidly shaking her head ata group of reporters who tried to corner her for questions about her selection of a running mate It almost seems seizure-esque to me Hannity declared Aug 10 although the two doctors on his show refused to confirm his diagnosis It looks like violent out-of-control movements on her partAs further evidence Hannity revisited the incident Aug 11 and pointed to the reaction of one reporter saying Watch the reporter like pull back as she  the reporter got scaredOn Aug 12 the reporter in question Lisa Lerer of the Associated Press  of the encounter with Clinton For the record I wasnt scared for a moment she wrote about the unfounded speculation As she explained Perhaps eager to avoid answering or maybe just taken aback by our volume Clinton responded with an exaggerated motion shaking her head vigorously for a few secondsIndeed Clinton was simply dodging the reporters questions as they gathered around her in a Washington muffin shop You guys have got to try the cold chai she answered On Aug 7 photographs circulated on the Web of Clinton needing help getting up a flight of stairs The conservative and pro-Trump Drudge Report in particular drew attention to the photographs with the headline Hillary Conquers the Stairs as staff aides appear to steady ClintonBut the photographs were five months old taken when she slipped while walking up the stairs at a South Carolina facility for former felons (The photo caption at the time ) Everyone slips every so often  and plenty of other photographs show that Clinton hasno trouble navigating stairs Again in August photographs  of Clinton apparently wearing a boxy contraption underneath her clothing One explanation is that the object is a defibrillator social media posts proclaimed A defibrillator will deliver an electric shock if it detects an abnormal heart rhythmSnopes  the photos came from a video shot in February 2016  and that the bulge in her back could not be from a defibrillator Instead it appeared she wasusing a wireless microphone which requires use of a wireless transmitter Other photographs of the candidate from the same day wearing the same clothes showed no bulge Conservative websites also havefanned speculation that one of Clintons Secret Service agents is actually a doctor who carries a  pen in case she has a seizure (Some coughing fits by Clinton also highlighted by conservative media were said to be reactions to her anti-seizure medicine) But the doctor was indeed a Secret Service agent Assistant Special Agent in Charge Todd Madison and he was likely Given Trumps  it should be little surprise that through innuendo he is trying to surface debunked Internet rumors from the fringes of the right But these are also half-baked ridiculous and easily disproved making it especially shocking that he would try to highlight themin prepared speechesBoth major-party candidates have issued letters from their doctors attesting to their health Both could clearly do more especially given the standard set by McCain eight years ago But in the absence of additional information theres little reason for a major-party nominee such as Trump to traffic in rumors and innuendoTrump has claimed twice without proof that Clinton lacks the physical and mental stamina to be president In the absence of any evidence he earns Four Pinocchios()How would you rate this claim (The check mark means you think the statement is true not that you agree with the rating)We need to verify that you are an actual person This is a non-scientific user poll Results are not statistically valid and cannot be assumed to reflect the views of Washington Post users as a group or the general populationPresident Trumps  that former president Barack Obama wiretapped him is based on  whatThat has been the question ever since Trump sent provocative early-morning tweets over the weekend because he and his staff have provided no evidenceAt The Fact Checker we require the accuser to provide the evidence for a dramatic claim We asked Saturday and received no answerHowever in calling for acongressional investigation of apparent Russian meddling in the election to also look intoTrumps allegation White House press secretary Sean Spicer on March 5referred to reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations That suggests the tweets were based on media reports not information the president might have received from inside the governmentOur colleague Robert Costa has reported that White House aides have internally circulated  on Breitbart titled Mark Levin to Congress Investigate Obamas Silent Coup vs Trump Breitbart is a right-leaning news organization that is a rather unreliable source of information Often the material that is published is derivative and twisted in misleading waysHowever a White House spokesman told The Fact Checker that the White Houseinstead is relying on reports from BBC Heat Street New York Times Fox News among others He provided a list of fivearticlesLets explore the sources of the presidents claimWe are going to start with the Breitbart article which lists two key data points that appear to relate to the presidents claim FISA [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] request The Obama administration files a request with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to monitor communications involving Donald Trump and several advisers The request uncharacteristically is denied FISA request The Obama administration submits a new narrow request to the FISA court now focused on a computer server in Trump Tower suspected of links to Russian banks No evidence is found  but the wiretaps continue ostensibly for national security reasons Andrew McCarthy at National Review later notes The Obama administration is now monitoring an opposing presidential campaign using the high-tech surveillance powers of the federal intelligence servicesBut these data points are not based on reporting by Breitbart Instead Breitbartlinks to that appeared in Heat Street another right-leaning news organization EXCLUSIVE FBI Granted FISA Warrant Covering Trump Camps Ties To Russia It was written by Louise Mensch a former Tory member of the British Parliament and an independent journalist This is one of the news reports identified by the White House and its the most important oneThis article claimed Two separate sources with links to the counter-intelligence community have confirmed to Heat Street that the FBI sought and was granted a FISA court warrant in October giving counter-intelligence permission to examine the activities of US persons in Donald Trumps campaign with ties to RussiaMensch claimed that the warrant was related to an FBI investigation of a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to two Russian banks  an investigation that apparently went nowhere Her article makes no mention of a wiretapThe FISA warrant was granted in connection with the investigation of suspected activity between the server [in Trump Tower] and two banks SVB Bank and Alfa Bank However it is thought in the intelligence community that the warrant covers any US person connected to this investigation and thus covers Donald Trump and at least three further men who have either formed part of his campaign or acted as his media surrogates Mensch wrote(Note While Heat Street says the server in question is in Trump Tower  have suggested the server actually was located in Philadelphia Thats because the Trump domain was controlled by a company that outsourced emails to another company called Listrak which actually operates the physical server in a data center in Philadelphia)The Washington Post for months has sought to confirm this report of a FISA warrant related to the Trump campaign but has been unable to do so Presumably other major news organizations have tried to do so as well So one has to take this claim with a huge dose of skepticism Indeed the New York Times  that the FBI ultimately concluded that there could be an innocuous explanation like a marketing email or spam for the computer contacts with the Russian banksInterestingly as far as we can tell only two other reports have touched on this FISA claim and they also have British connections One is  from January which the White House cited as a source The BBC reportedLawyers from the National Security Division in the Department of Justice then drew up an application They took it to the secret US court that deals with intelligence the FISA court named after the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act They wanted permission to intercept the electronic records from two Russian banksTheir first application in June was rejected outright by the judge They returned with a more narrowly drawn order in July and were rejected again Finally before a new judge the order was granted on 15 October three weeks before election dayNeither Mr Trump nor his associates are named in the FISA order which would only cover foreign citizens or foreign entities  in this case the Russian banks But ultimately the investigation is looking for transfers of money from Russia to the United States each one if proved a felony offenseA lawyer  outside the Department of Justice but familiar with the case  told me that three of Mr Trumps associates were the subject of the inquiry But its clear this is about Trump he saidFinally there was  which reported on the supposed June FISA request but could not confirm the October one (The White House did not cite the Guardian)The Guardian has learned that the FBI applied for a warrant from the foreign intelligence surveillance (FISA) court over the summer in order to monitor four members of the Trump team suspected of irregular contacts with Russian officials The FISA court turned down the application asking FBI counter-intelligence investigators to narrow its focus According to one report the FBI was finally granted a warrant in October but that has not been confirmed and it is not clear whether any warrant led to a full investigationSeparately McClatchy in mostly focused on whether money from the Kremlin covertly aided Trumps campaignreported one source had confirmed the FBI had obtained a warrant on Oct 15 from the highly secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Courtallowing investigators access to bank records and other documents about potential payments and money transfers related to Russia This echoed the BBC report but is much different than the Heat Street account (The White House also did not mention this report as a source for Trumps claim)The White House provided three other sources Two a  and  are simply derivative of the Heat Street article with no independent confirmation (The National Review article first speculated about wiretaps and was cited by Breitbart) The third is a that intelligence agencies are examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of a probe of possible links between Russian officials and Trump campaign aides (We recall that the president has previously deemed Times reporting on this matter as fake news)So what do we have hereOnly onearticle with British roots reported that a FISA court order was granted in October to examine possible activity between two Russian banks and a computer server in the Trump Tower This claim has not been confirmed by US news organizations Moreover no article says that Obama requested the order or that it resulted in the tapping of Trumps phone lines The server in fact may not have even been in Trump Tower(Our colleague Ellen Nakashima  how difficult it is to obtain a wiretap of a US citizen as part of a foreign intelligence investigation)Moreover the articles do not support the White Houses claim that these were potentially politically motivated investigations led by Obama The articles all suggest that the FISA requests if they happened  were done by the intelligence agencies and the FBI The BBC says the investigation was prompted by a tip from a Baltic country about possible criminal activityLast April the CIA director was shown intelligence that worried him It was  allegedly  a tape recording of a conversation about money from the Kremlin going into the US presidential campaignIt was passed to the US by an intelligence agency of one of the Baltic States The CIA cannot act domestically against American citizens so a joint counter-intelligence task force was createdWe should also note that a spokesman for Obama has denied the allegation that the former president ordered a wiretap on TrumpMoreover James Clapper the former director of national intelligence under Obama  on Sunday that in the national intelligence activity he oversaw there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president the president-elect at the time as a candidate or against his campaign Clapper said as intelligence director he would have known about a FISA court order on something like this Absolutely I can deny itAsked again whether there was a FISA court order to monitor Trump Tower Clapper repliedNot to my knowledgeFBI Director James B Comey  the Justice Department to issue a statement refuting President Trumps claim that Obama ordered a wiretap of Trumps phones before the election US officials told news organizations Mensch the author of the Heat Street article cited by the White House tweeted she never reported there was wiretap and instead pointed the finger at Breitbart (which as we noted above appears not to have doneindependent reporting)I see a lot of panic from Trumpers now Im pointing out Paul Wood Julian Borger and I did not report any Wiretap  Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) BBC   and I none of us report wire at Trump Tower just warrant If there IS one who leaked to  Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) While the Trump White House cited five news reports to justify its request for a congressional investigation only two actually are relevantIts certainly ironic that the Trump White House  which has heavily criticized articles relying on anonymous sources  now relieson articles based on anonymous sources that cite information that has not been confirmed by any US news organization It would be amusing if it were not so sadAfter all Clapper who presumably would be aware of a FISA court order has issued an on-the-record denialEven if these media reports are accepted as accurate neither back up Trumps claims that Obama ordered the tapping of his phone calls Moreover they also do not back up the administrations revised claim of politically motivated investigationsWere still waiting for the evidence In the meantime Trump earns Four PinocchiosAfterCNN reported that the US government wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort some readers asked us to reconsider this ruling saying he was vindicated We still found no evidence to support Trumps claim and ()President Trump will be traveling to severalcountries during his first trip abroad as commander in chief Heres a quick look at where hes going andthe highlights of the trip Meet Pope Francis and tour St PetersBasilica In Rome hewill also meet Italian President Sergio Mattarella andPrime MinisterPaolo GentiloniHow Trump will greet Francis The two will finally get a chance to meet for the first time  last year The pope said anyone who builds a wall is not Christian Trump a presidential candidate at the time shot back For a religious leader to question a persons faith is disgraceful Francis has said that before meeting himMeet with NATO heads of state and the presidents of the European Union and the European CouncilTrump will participate in a NATO meeting with who has voiced numerous times What Trump says about NATO considering that he has publicly flip-flopped on his position Trump had called the alliance obsolete then surprisingly after meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg Another topic that probably willcome upis funding During his last trip to Brussels Mattis had demanded that allies  or risk altering their relationship with theUnited States Attend the Group of Seven summit The 43rd annual summit  which involves the United States Canada Britain Germany Italy France and Japan  will be a time for countries to address their own agendas According to the White House Trump plans on touching onthe US economy and increased security cooperation The summit will be an interesting time to see all of the newly elected world leaders assembled in one place including French President  and British Prime MinisterIt was supposed to be steaming toward North Korea more than a week ago an armada signaling American resolve Then it Now it seems the USS Carl Vinson may finally be heading northOur deployment has been extended 30 days to provide a persistent presence in the waters off the Korean Peninsula Rear Adm Jim Kilby commander of Carrier Strike Group One said in a  posted on the Carl Vinsons Facebook page and addressed to families and loved ones of the personnel on board  The Carl Vinson accompanied by a carrier air wing two guided-missile destroyers and a cruiser was reported to have been ordered to sail north after leaving Singapore on April8 But a week later the Navy published photos showing it was actually sailing in the opposite direction through the Sunda Strait between the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java more than 3000 miles southwest of the Korean Peninsula  and more than 500 miles southeast of SingaporeIt appears the confusion over its whereabouts stemmed from a US Pacific Command announcement that could have been worded a little more clearly in the words of a defense official speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the recordOn April9 the Pacific Command announced that the strike group was heading to the Western Pacific even as a spokesman for the Pacific Command linked the move directly to North Koreas reckless irresponsible and destabilizing program of missile tests and pursuit of a nuclear weapons capabilityDays later Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters that the Carl Vinson was on her way up there In an interview that aired April12 President Trump said the United States was sending ships An armada very powerful he saidThey were not exactly wrong Navy officials now say Its just that the change of course toward the Korean Peninsula had not happened yetWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer during his daily media briefing on Wednesday disputed the notion that the administration had led anyone astrayWhat part is misleading Im trying to figure that out Spicer said We were asked a question about what signal [the decision to dispatch the carrier to the Western Pacific] sent We answered the question on what signal it sent Im not the one who commented on timingIt is not clear why the carrier strike group stayed in Southeast Asia or why the Trump administration did not clarify where it was On Tuesday the Pacific Command said only that the strike group had completed military exercises  and would now head northAfter departing Singapore on April8 and canceling a scheduled port visit to Perth the Strike Group was able to complete a curtailed period of previously scheduled training with Australia in international waters off the northwest coast of Australia a US Pacific Command spokesman said in a statement The Carl Vinson Strike Group is heading north to the Western Pacific as a prudent measureIn Riyadh Saudi Arabia Mattis said Wednesday The bottom line is in our effort to always be open about what we were doing we said that we that we were going to change the Vinsons upcoming schedule The Vinson as I said on the record was operating up and down the Western Pacific and we were doing exactly what we said That is we were shifting herWe dont generally give out ship schedules in advance but I didnt want to play a game either and say we were not changing a schedule when in fact we had So were doing exactly what we said we were going to do She will be on her way and Ill determine when she gets there and where she actually operates but the Vinson will be a part of our ensuring that we stand by our allies in the northwest PacificUS and South Korean news media have reported that the Carl Vinson is now expected to arrive off the Korean Peninsula by April25 just as North Korea marks the anniversary of its armys foundingOur mission is to reassure allies and our partners of our steadfast commitment to the Indo-Asia-Pacific region wrote Kilby the carrier group commander We will continue to be the centerpiece of visible maritime deterrence providing our national command authority with flexible deterrent options all domain access and a visible forward presenceChina meanwhile is feeling anything but reassured warning recently that a storm is about to break over the divided Korean Peninsula Thomas Gibbons-Neff in Riyadh and Missy Ryan in Washington contributed to this reportBergdahl 31 faces life in prison He said few words during the first day of his presentencing hearing having pleaded guilty to charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy in connection with his 2009 disappearance and five-year captivity by a Taliban affiliateBut the court heard several sound bites from Trump as the judge Army Col Jeffrey R Nance sought to determine whether the presidents new comments affirmed his past statements about Bergdahl being a dirty rotten traitorSpeaking to reporters last week Trump declined to say whether his previous attacks on Bergdahl may have unfairly influenced the soldiers decision to plead guilty Yet his word choice  But I think people have heard my comments in the past the president said  was the subject of debate between Nance and attorneys for the defense and prosecution In 2015 Trump also promised to review decisions made in the case if he were to become commander in chief      Lead defense attorney Eugene Fidell filed a motion saying Trumps latest comments build on his harsh campaign rhetoric and amount to unlawful command influence thus compromising Bergdahls chances to receive a fair sentencing The motion seeks to dismiss the case on those groundsTrumps comments reconfirmed his past statements and produced a chilling effect on the military justice system Fidell said  to such a degree that Nance should not impose jail time for BergdahlWords have meaning And but means what Nance asked prosecutor Maj Justin Oshana who disputed Fidells assertion that Trump continues to hold such views about BergdahlNance challenged Oshana for much of the presentencing hearing which lasted an hour and concluded with a recess until WednesdayNance had ruled in February that Trumps campaign remarks while disturbing did not amount to unlawful command influence But he appears to be reconsidering The reasons [to dismiss earlier accusations] tend to be eroded when the now-president of the United States apparently adopts those past statements Nance told the prosecutor Nance added his interpretation of Trumps meaning to be I shouldnt comment on that but I think everyone knows what I think on Bowe BergdahlPressed further on Trumps verbiage Oshana offered that the presidents words were not the best constructed a statement that elicited stifled chuckles in the courtroomNance said he purposely avoided media reports about Bergdahls case adding I dont have any doubt whatsoever I can be fair and impartial in this sentencing He intends to retire soon he noted and is not slated for a promotion suggesting commanders had little leverage to pressure him to enforce a harsher penaltyOshana pointed to a White House statement issued Friday that he characterized as evidence Trump has not sought to influence what punishment Bergdahl receivesThe President expects all military personnel who are involved in any way in the military justice process to exercise their independent professional judgment consistent with applicable laws and regulations the statement says It does not mention Bergdahl by name howeverBergdahl entered a guilty plea last week to charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy the second of which carries the possibility of a life sentence He declined an opportunity Monday to withdraw those pleasHe vanished from his remote base in Afghanistan in 2009 and was captured by the Taliban at whose hands he endured five years of brutal captivity before he was handed over in a controversial prisoner swap in 2014 in which five Taliban militants also were freedNance is expected to rule this week on Bergdahls motion to dismiss the case There will be no court activity Tuesday or Friday raising the possibility that his decision on Bergdahls fate will come next week Prosecutors are expected this week to use testimony from troops who have said they were injured on recovery missions after Bergdahl walked off his outpostNance has ruled previously that a Navy SEAL and an Army National Guard sergeant were wounded in firefights that probably would not have happened if Bergdahl had not disappearedDonald Trumps main man in Virginia was winding down his pitch for the Republican nominee when a teacher in the audience asked whether Trump would ever forsake his fondness for rhetorical grenades and delve into policyNot to worry replied Corey A Stewart  in the commonwealth insisting that enough time remains for the candidate to immerse himself in the details of economics and national securityHe is as you might imagine extraordinarily intelligent Stewart promised the gathering of Loudoun County Republicans on a recent nightHis audiences silence did nothing to deflate Stewarts enthusiasmHes a very quick study he saidHe manages his time very wellHes Mr EnergizerOver the past six months as Trump emerged as the GOPs nominee many  and political operatives have rebuked and otherwise disassociated themselves from the bombastic New York mogulYet Stewart 48 exhibits no such reticence reveling in his role as Trumps combative Mini-Me in Virginia and betting that his alliance with the Republican nominee will propel his own quest to win the commonwealths 2017 gubernatorial raceWith polls showing Trump trailing Hillary Clinton in the crucial swing state Stewart acknowledges that his gambit is high risk particularly in a place where seismic demographic shifts have helped Democrats capture every statewide race since 2009  Yet as Virginias self-anointed face of Trumpism Stewart contends that he stands to inherit a potent electoral base  the legions of white working-class voters propelling Trumps candidacyMy fate is very closely tied with his  if he loses my job is harder Stewart conceded Yet even if Trump is defeated he said I dont think that diminishes the fact that theres a movement here and that the Republican Party  and probably all of American politics  is forever changed I want to be the leading edge of that spearAs Trumps voice in Virginia Stewart embraces the businessmans caustic tone at one point this summer writing on his own Facebook page Hey Hillary you suck Indeed Stewart is that rare surrogate who has managed to say something provocative enough that even Trumps campaign felt the need to reproach himAs the elected chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors Stewart a decade ago drew national attention promoting a crackdown on undocumented immigrants a policy that presaged the tempest more recently caused by Trumps own anti-immigrant barbsI was Trump before Trump was Trump Stewart likes to boast his grin suggesting no small amount of prideWhile he says he does not agree with all of Trumps ideas including his proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States Stewart exhibits little patience for those who express outrage over any number of the Republicans provocations including his recent assertion that People are being too sensitive Stewart said Im not concerned about the rhetoric The problem in American politics is weve stopped being honest and weve gotten all caught up and ultra-sensitive about the words people use instead of debating the ideas behind them Trump is trying to blast through itIn his fourth term as chairman Stewart is an affable pol who as a Republican has managed to maintain power in a county that was ground zero for the states population shifts and supported President Obama in 2008 and 2012Yet Stewart has failed to ascend politically losing a 2013 bid for  Even his friends suspect that his alliance with Trump is a desperate attempt to raise his statewide profileIts a risky Hail Mary which in my mind will end up being a failure said David Ramadan a Stewart friend and a former Republican state legislator in Virginia Its one thing to speak ones mind plainly and to be candid and its another to be a racist fascist demagogue which is what Trump isCorey made the wrong decision he saidStewart dismissed his friends verdictI know hes not a racist and I know hes not a fascist Stewart said of Trump What Trump is trying to do is break through the political [expletive] Historically were going to look back on that as a tremendous service to the countryOn a Wednesday afternoon more than 150 Republican women at a Tea for Trump in Fredericksburg laughed and applauded when an activist introduced Stewart to the crowd as a little Trumpish and recounted that he had recently gotten into a little trouble for something he saidThe speaker Alice Butler-Short was referring to Stewarts July8 Facebook post in which he wrote after five Dallas cops were fatally shot that Clinton and Virginia Lt Gov Ralph Northam are to blame for essentially encouraging the murder of these police officersStewarts post led to a Trump spokeswoman saying Corey does not speak for the campaign and this is not something we agree withDid he say Oh dear Im sorry Butler-Short asked the audience No He double-downed Good for you CoreyTaking the stage Stewart wasted no time bashing Clinton saying Theres never been anyone more qualified to be in prison and praising Trump for having woken us upOver the past 40years America has lost something  we have lost the virtue of candor he said Why Because the left wing has belittled embarrassed and ridiculed conservative speech And when you stand up what do they label us Bigots and racistsThe only way were going to take our country back is to speak honestly about the issues he saidDescribing for the audience the origin of his involvement in the presidential race Stewart recalled Trumps answer when asked why he chose him as Virginia state chair Youre the only one who had the guts to crack down on illegal immigrants  Stewart uses his Trump appearances to remind the public that amid a surge in the Latino population in Prince William County he led a push in 2007 to enable police to ask people they stopped about their immigration status a policy that was later relaxed to focus only on those arrestedThe clampdown caused a furor that vaulted Stewart to the center of a national debate over immigration and prompted accusations that he was encouraging racial profiling and bigotry to curry favor with votersStewart whose wife Maria is a Swedish immigrant insisted then and now that he was motivated by his belief in enforcing the countrys immigration laws Yet his role in the uproar cost him allies including Elena Schlossberg a Prince William activist who had thrown a fundraiser for him when he ran for chairmanHe understood how you could have land preservation and still be a Republican and he was that same engaging very funny and affable guy she recalled But after he backed the crackdown on undocumented immigrants she recalled telling him Corey youre making a colossal mistake You dont want to attach yourself to this kind of ugliness Save your soulAt the time Virginia was in the midst of a demographic upheaval with the states Latino population having nearly doubled and the number of Asians increasing sharply After the controversy quieted Stewart turned to economic issues and cultivated the image of a leader seeking consensus He forged relationships with leaders of the countys immigrant groups the growth of which had turned Prince William into a minority majority county  After not speaking with him for years Schlossberg said Stewart called her last year asking for help defusing any tensions that might arise from a Muslim groups plan to build a mosqueHe said You know Elena I dont want to go back to 2007 to that very ugly time Schlossberg recalled He said he wanted to help the community come togetherSoon after she said Trump announced that Stewart was his man in VirginiaHe wanted to do something good and then it was replaced with this need to be part of a big political show Schlossberg said How can you get on the Trump train and think all those people in the Muslim and Latino communities would have any trust in youAs a Trump acolyte Stewart embraced the candidates call for a wall on the border between the United States and Mexico After Trump supporters fought with protesters in California in June Stewart posted on Facebook that he would not tolerate such antics in Virginia as governorIf they are illegal Stewart wrote we will kick their asses out of the country just like we did in Prince William CountyOn a late Friday afternoon Stewart sits at the kitchen table at his Woodbridge home a one-time tobacco plantation built in 1740 where George and Martha Washington stayed during their honeymoonA portrait of Mother Teresa hangs on the wall Stewart would prefer to remove the photo he said but it remains because his wife is spooked by the plantations haunted history and she says No one is going to mess with Mother TeresaWhen Trumps staffers asked him to join the campaign Stewart said he took a week to consider the offer because I knew there were going to be people disappointed when I made the decisionHe made nearly two dozen phone calls including to Muslim associates already infuriated by Trumps call for a ban on Muslims visiting the United States Stewart himself disagreed with the proposed ban because I dont think its right to label a whole religion of people because you have a few bad applesNevertheless Stewart said he decided to support Trump because he was upending a stale political order and he predicted that his focus on pocketbook issues would mean more to Americans than whether he offended anyone with his rhetoricHistory is not formed by wallflowers Stewart said I want to be part of history I dont want to be some guy thats a footnoteIf nothing else he said Trump has reaffirmed his belief that I can be myselfAnd if you dont like it piss off Stewart said I dont have to change my personality and I can win at the highest levelsTrump administration officials said Tuesday that President Trump was not taking sides in the deepening dispute among key US counterterrorism partners in the Persian Gulf despite a morning of presidential Twitter posts congratulating Saudi Arabia  and himself  for cracking down on Qatar for alleged terrorism financingDuring my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology Trump tweeted Leaders pointed to Qatar  lookSo good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off he continued They said they would take a hard line on funding extremism and all reference was pointing to QatarOn Monday several of Qatars gulf neighbors  Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain  were joined by Egypt and smaller nations in severing diplomatic ties with Qatar ordering its diplomats and citizens to leave and threatening deeply intertwined regional trade links and air routes  The eruption appeared motivated by years-long regional disputes rather than any recent disagreement or action It followed a late-May visit in which Trump while calling on the Arab and Muslim worlds to unite against the terrorist threat heaped praise on Saudi Arabia as the regional leaderSecretary of State Rex Tillerson in New Zealand called for dialogue among the neighbors At the State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said that we recognize that Qatar continues to make efforts to stop the financing of terrorist groups including prosecuting suspected financiers freezing assets introducing stringent controls into its banking system They have made progress  but we recognize there is more work to be doneLets move off this social-media thing Nauert said of numerous questions about Trumps tweets because there are a lot of other important things that we need to discussA senior administration official said Were not taking sides If we are taking sides we are taking the side of unity and cooperation against terrorism The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive diplomatic issueNauert and the senior official said the United States had been notified of Saudi Arabias intention to break relations shortly before the move was announced Monday But I dont think the US government has perfect clarity on what triggered that the official said We know there have been issues between themThe Pentagon whose air operations for the Middle East are headquartered at a massive air base in Qatar where at least 10000 US service members are stationed opted for balance and calming wordsWe recognize that there are differing views in the region that have gotten us to this point it said in a statement United States and the Coalition are grateful to the Qataris for their longstanding support of our presence and their enduring commitment to regional security We have no plans to change our posture in Qatar  The statement said restrictions that Qatars gulf neighbors have imposed on Qatari movements in and out of the region have not impacted our air operations including missions in Iraq Syria and AfghanistanSen Bob Corker (R-Tenn) chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee shook his head in a Capitol hallway when shown Trumps tweets on a reporters cellphone Each of these countries are people that are important to our country he said Our general policy as America has been to work with each of themWe do have a base there that we operate out of thats very important he said of QatarDuring last months visit to Saudi Arabia where he delivered a speech to dozens of leaders from Muslim-majority nations gathered for the occasion Trump met personally with Qatars emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad al-Thani We are friends Weve been friends now for a long time  Our relationship is extremely good Trump said at the beginning of the closed-door meeting One of the things we will discuss is the [Qatari] purchase of lots of beautiful military equipmentThe senior administration official said that Trump addressed US concerns in private with the Qatari leaderIn New Zealand on Tuesday Tillerson emphasized that all countries in the gulf region have their own challenges to live up to that commitment to terminate support for terrorism extremism however it manifests itself anywhere in the world And I would say thats true of all the GCC countries they have their own work to do in that regardThe GCC is the Gulf Cooperation Council whose six members  Saudi Arabia Bahrain the UAE Kuwait Oman and Qatar  signed a communique with Trump pledging to continue their joint fight against terrorism The visit also culminated in what the administration said was $110billion in arms sales to Saudi ArabiaThe White House said in a statement Tuesday evening that Trump spoke by phone with Saudi Arabias King Salman about preventing terrorist financing and eliminating the promotion of extremism by any nation in the region Trump it said underscored that a united Gulf Cooperation Council is critical to defeating terrorism and promoting regional stabilitySmall but influential Qatar has long been at odds with some of its regional neighbors over its support for the Muslim Brotherhood which is seen by Saudi Arabia and other nations as a threat to the network of ruling monarchs and others across the regionQatar the worlds largest exporter of liquefied natural gas also flexed its political influence by using its energy wealth to become a key patron of groups such as Hamas in the Gaza Strip and in the mid-1990s to launch the Al Jazeera media network which has wide reach through the Arab-speaking worldUS officials who monitor terrorist funding have said that gulf governments have made significant strides in ending official support for terrorist groups although some money still flows from individuals primarily in Kuwait and to a lesser extent from QatarSaudi Arabia has come under scrutiny for indirectly backing militant networks through groups promoting the Saudis strict Wahhabi interpretation of IslamGerd Nonneman a professor of international relations at the Doha campus of Georgetown University one of a number of US universities with branches in the Qatari capital said the dispute was fueled by irritation in Saudi Arabia and the UAE with Qatars independence of mind in foreign policy including its support for the Arab Spring movementsQatars backing for the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist organizations Nonneman said in an email has been driven by a pragmatic calculation that these movements had considerable social traction and would likely become an important part of the post-Arab Spring era Qatar he noted also refused to join the campaign to fully isolate Iran  even while it furiously disagreed with Irans policies in SyriaThe desire to isolate Iran in addition to the fight against terrorist groups such as the Islamic State has brought the Trump administration closer to Saudi Arabia and the UAE The administration has considered designating the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group although it was dissuaded from immediate action by other Arab leaders including King Abdullah II in Jordan one of several countries in which Brotherhood political parties have significant supportSaudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir speaking Tuesday in Paris mentioned Qatars support for Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood saying that it has to choose whether it must move in one direction or the other according to the Reuters news agencyIn the wake of Mondays events Kuwait took the lead in trying to broker a dialogue The countrys emir Sabah Ahmed al-Sabah headed to Saudi Arabia for talks with King SalmanBut there were signs that the feud was dividing the region beyond the gulf Jordan a close ally of Saudi Arabia announced that it was downgrading its diplomatic relations with Qatar and canceling the license of the local Al Jazeera office according to the Foreign MinistryIn Turkey which has tried to mediate the dispute President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the Saudi-led actions against Qatar These developments coming at a time when we need solidarity and cooperation more than ever are no good for any country in the region he said in remarks quoted by the semiofficial Anadolu news agencyQatari officials pushed back forcefully at the terrorism accusations and portrayed themselves as victims of a Saudi-led conspiracy In a letter to UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres Qatars UN ambassador Alya Ahmed al-Thani said her country had been a target of campaigns of fabricated accusations and a hidden agenda to cause harm to our countryShe referred to recently leaked emails allegedly written to the UAEs ambassador to the United States Yousef al-Otaiba which appear to show Otaiba trying to garner support in Washington for an anti-Qatar coalition Fahim reported from Istanbul and Raghavan from Cairo Mike DeBonis in Washington contributed to this reportIf the United States were to strike North Korea Kim Jong Uns regime would retaliate by unleashing its conventional weaponry lined up on the demilitarized zone that has separated the two Koreas for about seven decadesAnd that conventional weaponry is reliable unlike North Koreas missiles and could cause major devastation in South Korea which is a staunch ally of the United States This becomes a very limiting factor for the US said Carl Baker a retired Air Force officer with extensive experience in South KoreaAs tensions between North Korea and the outside world have risen over the past month there has been  either to preempt a North Korean provocation or to respond to oneThat talk continues even after it emerged that the Navy  to the Korean Peninsula region as officials including President Trump had impliedSen Lindsey O Graham (R-SC) said this week that he supported striking North Korea to stop it from developing the capability to reach the United States with a missile  even if that came at a huge cost for the regionIt would be terrible but the war would be over [in South Korea] it wouldnt be here Graham said in an interview with NBC  Although most of the recent focus has been on North Koreas ambition to be able to strike the continental United States with a missile the people of South Korea have been living under the constant threat of a conventional North Korean attack for decadesNorth Korea has a tremendous amount of artillery right opposite Seoul saidJoseph S Bermudez Jr a senior imagery analyst at  a website focused on North KoreaThe Second Corps of the Korean Peoples Army stationed at Kaesong on the northern side of the DMZ has about 500 artillery pieces Bermudez said And this is just one army corps similar corps are on either side of itAll the artillery pieces in the Second Corps can reach the northern outskirts of Seoul just 30miles from the DMZ but the largest projectiles could fly to the south of the capital About 25million people  or half of the South Korean population  live in the greater Seoul metropolitan areaIts the tyranny of proximity said David Maxwell who served in South Korea during his 30 years in the Army and now teaches at Georgetown University Its like the distance between Baltimore and Washington DC Imagine a million-man army just outside the Beltway with artillery they could use to terrorize WashingtonAbout half of North Koreas artillery pieces are multiple rocket launchers including 18 to 36 of the huge 300mm launchers that Pyongyang has bragged about State media last year published photos of the system during a test firing that Kim attendedThe 300mm guns could probably fire eight rounds every 15minutes Bermudez said and have a range of about 44miles  This could do a lot of damage he said If they hit a high-rise building with a couple of rounds of artillery people get into their cars causing huge traffic jams so North Korea could target highways and bridges in cascadesIf North Korea were to start unleashing its artillery on the South it would be able to fire about 4000 rounds an hour Roger Cavazos of the Nautilus Institute  There would be 2811 fatalities in the initial volley and 64000 people could be killed that first day the majority of them in the first three hours he wroteSome of the victims would be American because the US military has about 28000 troops in South Korea The higher estimates for the 300mm rocket launchers range  up to 65miles  would put the US Air Force base at Osan and the new military garrison at Pyeongtaek the replacement for the huge base in Seoul within reachThis prospect of extensive damage and casualties has restrained successive US administrations however provocative North Korea has beenEvery US administration as they have looked at this problem has said that all options are available But thats not really true said Baker who is at the Pacific Forum of the Center for Strategic and International Studies We really dont have a military optionVice President Pence  said that all options are on the table for dealing with North Korea echoing statements that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made in Seoul last month  There was a similar discussion in 1994 when North Korea threatened to go nuclear sparking talk of surgical strikesPeople in Washington were saying We have the capability to do this but those of us who were sitting in Seoul said You cant do that Baker saidIt is not just South Korea that would suffer Such action would be devastating for North Korea too because the US and South Korean militaries have spent decades developing their counter-battery capability as well as developing plans for airstrikes to take out North Koreas facilitiesDefending Seoul against such a threat is the top priority for the alliance said Chun In-bum a retired lieutenant general in the South Korean army who served as commander of South Koreas Special Warfare CommandThe US and South Korean response would be immediate We have assets along the DMZ dedicated for doing this job and counter-battery units trained to conduct these missions Chun saidAlthough the White House has doubled down on its statements on the USS Carl Vinson heading to the Korean Peninsula  Its happening spokesman Sean Spicer said this week  former military officers on both sides of the alliance say they are sure that Trump will not put South Korean lives at riskI believe that General [Jim] Mattis and General [HR] McMaster are well aware of this Maxwell said referring to the defense secretary and the national security adviserOf course it concerns me Chun said of the recent talk about strikes but Ive always believed that with good common sense and engagement cooler heads will prevailArmy counterintelligence officials in South Korea areinvestigating fakemobile alerts and social media messages warning American military families and Defense Department personnel of orders to evacuate the volatile peninsula on ThursdayUS Forces Korea did NOT send this message officials said in a subsequentFacebook post They warned that Americans living in South Korea with US troops and Defense Department employees should confirm that any evacuation-related communications are legitimate before acting  Anyone receiving this false message should not click any links or open any attachments included in the correspondence the Facebook message saidThe US military did not indicate who it thought had sent the phony messages and it is unclear whether any military networks were compromised An advisory issued by the Army and  urged people who have received the message to report it to an Army counterintelligence unit which assess attempts by adversaries and their foreign intelligence services to exploit or access US networksThe fake warnings come at a sensitive time as President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un trade insults and the United States presses the rogue regime to stop its nuclear weapons program Such efforts have done little to rein in the dictatorOn Friday after the White House announceda new round ofeconomic sanctions to further isolate theNorth Kim  whom Trump has taken to calling Rocket Manthreatened to detonate a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific OceanTheUS military command in Korea routinely rehearses such evacuations typically in the spring and fall About 28500 US troops are stationed on the peninsula along with thousands more family membersAny such evacuation would be announced by the US Embassy in Seoul If a situation develops quickly and the Department of State requires assistance in the evacuation of noncombatants the Secretary of State will request that the military assist in the evacuation the plan states During this stage the military will assemble the noncombatants and then either relocate or evacuate them to a safer placeThe Army advised that if an evacuation is ordered Americans should carry with them irreplaceable documents a first-aid kit extra clothing a flashlight and a blanket or sleeping bag The service also recommends that families prepare a kit ahead of time that includes a backpack legal documents three days of food bottled water prescription medications toiletries and a handheld radioThe Republic of Korea has the most heavily defended border in the world the plan said Though the probability of conflict remains low the potential of hostilities occurring on the Korean peninsula is greater than in many other parts of the worldThe 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has become an unexpected lightning rod this campaign season This important new trade agreement has prompted heated  between US presidential candidates and provoked infighting among  and  party-platform writers Theres even a multi-act  to

critics like Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch express similar concerns that the administration may have missed a pivotal opportunity with the TPP to get the  for the American people  By contrast President Obama has lobbied repeatedly for the agreement  touting it in  speeches and  He calls the TPP a  that will give the United States  Not surprisingly political leaders from    and other TPP signatories also claim the new agreement is a good deal for their countriesWe tackle this question head-on in a  finding that the TPP trade rules are skewed heavily in favor of the United States Our primary discovery is that much of the language in the actual TPP agreement is copy-pasted verbatim from earlier US trade agreements This is particularly true for controversial issues like investment where up to 90 percent of the text from past US investment chapters is inserted word-for-word into the TPP text These findings call into question critics claims that US negotiators failed to adequately represent US interests in the TPP  The text of the secretly negotiated TPP was  to the public last November after nearly a decade of opaque negotiations At more than 2700 pages few if any have  We admit weve not read  either but we have analyzed its complete contents  quite literallyUsing computational techniques similar to those used in commercial  detection software we compare the TPP to all of the trade agreements its dozen members have signed since 1995 The language in each countrys previous trade agreements provides useful insights into what negotiators push to include in subsequent agreements like the TPP Therefore our research seeks to demonstrate who wrote the rules in the TPP by analyzing the amount of overlap between the language in the TPP and the language in each members earlier trade agreementsTrade agreements like the TPP are often evaluated in terms of their  But the primary motivation for the TPP appears to be as much political as it is economic Because global trade cooperation via the World Trade Organization  the rules in the mega regional TPP could become the   President Obama has consistently emphasized this  motivation In a brief  with the Wall Street Journal he evoked the word rules no fewer than 11 times His specific rationale is geopolitical [T]he TPP means that America will  of the road in the 21st century  if America doesnt write those rules then countries like China willTwo revelations motivate our study We initially  the overlap among all TPP members earlier trade agreements and found surprisingly little content overlap between previous American Australian Japanese Mexican Vietnamese or Peruvian agreements among others  and their past bilateral agreements with China are even more dissimilar Thus it is clear that US negotiators prefer a distinct set of trade rules that they hope to advance through deals like the TPP Instead they are heavily copied and pasted from preexisting  which can have  and sometimes  consequences The TPP is lengthy and thus some of it is unique yet large sections were taken verbatim from earlier trade agreementsUS agreement language is much  in the TPP than language from Australian agreements  which ranks second  and far more dominant than language from Japan and Mexico both major global players in trade policyThe  that most closely mirror the TPP are all US agreements including bilateral US trade treaties with countries in Latin America Africa Asia and the Middle East For example half or more of the language in US trade agreements with South Korea Panama and Bahrain (which themselves overlap heavily with one another) is replicated word-for-word in the TPP Public Citizen has called the TPP  but it is these newer US agreements with individual countries that form the basis of the TPPOur methodology looked for a minimum of six identical consecutive words to constitute copied language but in reality we found  in the TPP lifted word-for-word from US agreements Trade agreements are lengthy so this amounts to tens of thousands of words in the TPP agreement being copied verbatim from past US bilateral agreementsMoreover the US imprint tends to be greatest on the most salient issues For example a 2013  on the TPP identified general services and financial services as among the areas of greatest US interest Perhaps not surprisingly these are the topics on which two-thirds or more of existing US trade language was copied verbatim into the parallel sections of the TPPInvestment is perhaps the most important and certainly the most  topic in the TPP  and the one where we see greatest US dominance As discussed here in the  various  and politicians have heavily criticized US-supported investment-treaty rules that allow  to pursue claims against foreign governments through international arbitration  Lo and behold the TPP investment chapter has US fingerprints all over it Our analysis shows that on average around  of the language in earlier US investment chapters is inserted into the TPP Ninety percent of the investment chapter in the US-Oman trade agreement for instance can be found word-for-word in the TPPs investment chapter So those critical of investment rules in past US agreements would probably be critical of the TPPs investment chapter  the language is essentially the same  These revelations about widespread copy-pasting do not necessarily mean the TPP is unquestionably positive for the United States Ones (re-)assessment likely depends on how one views the earlier US agreements that are now embedded in the TPP as well as globalization in generalBut it now seems difficult to claim that the US performed poorly in the TPP negotiations since much of its preferred language was inserted into the landmark new agreement by virtue of a few simple keystrokesThe UFC returned to Madison Square Garden for the second time with an impressive card featuring three title fights Amazingly those three title fights ended in three title changes in what was easily the most exciting card of the yearThe biggest upset occurred on the womens side with previously undefeated strawweight champion Joanna Jedrzejczyk losing to underdog challenger Rose Namajunas But new bantamweight champion TJ Dillashaws victory over his former teammate Cody Garbrandt was one of the more explosive fights of the nightOf course what everyone might be talking about in the days to come is the return of Georges St-Pierre who submitted now ex-middleweight champion Michael Bisping in the third round despite St-Pierres beaten and bloodied faceIn short it was a card that left fans and fellow fighters astounded and it injected a renewed excitement into the UFC brand that has been waning since Ronda Rouseys last defeat and Conor McGregors foray into boxingRead on for more details about what turned out to be a surprising UFC 217Its been 4 years since UFC gold has been around his waist    UFC (@ufc) After a four-year hiatus St-Pierre came back and showed that he might in fact be in his best shape yet both physically and mentally It took just into the third round for the veteran to beat Bisping who had won his last five boutsANOTHER HOOK THAT SET IT UP    UFC (@ufc)  GSP entered the octagon to thunderous applause It was an odd throwback to a different time as he stood in the familiar cage but in an unfamiliar spot the challengers corner And out came Bisping whod been cast as an unlikely champion despite him having earned his way to the top  he did knock out Luke Rockhold fair and square on the jaw to grab ahold of the belt hed so long coveted He came inbigger than GSP which was to be expected in a bout pitting a longtime 170-pound champ against a fighter who at one point campaigned as a 205-pounder When the fighting began a GSP GSP chant arose and the crowds hero took the lead in the fight He stalked the bigger Bisping connecting with crisp jabs Not much damage but a point was being made St-Pierre got a mid-round takedown but did little with it Toward the end of the five minutes St-Pierre connected with a Superman punch Bisping smiled and ate a spinning head kick He wobbled slightly but was fine as the horn sounded St-Pierre came out with less pace Was he pacing himself for potentially five rounds or was he tiring Bisping was trying to find out fighting with more urgency He connected with a looping right hand his best punch of the fight but didnt follow up GSP was picking his spot He got a takedown but Bisping made him work for it  and work to keep the champ on the canvas The challenger did no damage while on top and before long Bisping had got the fight back to standing He proceeded to land the occasional right hand and GSP looked to be slowing But the pace was slow so it was not sapping too much energy out of the long-idle ex-champ St-Pierre clearly looked tired as this round began but Bisping while not wearing the same tiredness on his face must not have been at full power because he was not putting pressure on his challenger Then GSP went for a takedown as he had in the second and he got it again This time he stayed on top for longer but he paid a price as Bisping hit him with something from the bottom that opened a cut on GSPs face Soon they were back on their feet and GSPs face was crimson But he looked rejuvenated and when Bisping came forward GSP countered with a left hook that dropped him to the canvas St-Pierre swarmed him on the ground and dropped elbow after elbow first with the left then with the right But there was no quit in Bisping who rolled away from the strikes St-Pierre then seized the rear-naked choke to get the victory to become middleweight championGarbrandt and Dillashaw were expected to bring fireworks and they did In the second title change of the night Dillashaw got the better of his former Alpha Male teammate Garbrandt to come out on topIn the lead-up to this night this co-main event overshadowed the main event and everything else in the UFC this side of Conor McGregor Of course sometimes when two fighters hate each other with such a passion that they cannot fathom what it would feel like to lose to that other guy it results in a dudThat didnt happen hereAfter being dropped and wobbled near the end of the first round Dillashaw floored the champion twice in the second initially with a right hand and later with a left head kick The second time he didnt let Garbrandt recover jumping on him with a flurry of punches to hand his former Team Alpha Male teammate his first loss and take back the bantamweight belt that he once ownedThe hooks have found homes tonight in the title fights    UFC (@ufc) But afterward the new champ wasnt thinking about bantamweight He was thinking about flyweight champion Demetrious Johnson who was in the standsIm coming for you Dillashaw said Will the UFC make that champ-vs-champ fight in the 125-pound division or at 135 Or will embittered former training partners Dillashaw (15-3) and Garbrandt (11-1) dance again Either way the fans winFirst Jedrzejczyk gets into your head Then she gets into your face Thats the way she fightsBut Namajunas was having none of it Eerily impassive in the weeks of lead-up she waited till fight night to hit back and she did so not with head games but with head punches She dropped the strawweight champ in the first round then got her again this time pouncing on the previously undefeated Pole to get the finish and take away the beltNamajunas (7-3) moved forward right from the start Thats a dangerous game against a buzzsaw like Jedrzejczyk and the thinking before the fight was that Thug Rose an all-around terror would have her best shot at success by taking the champ to the mat Well she took her there with a crisp left hook that collapsed JedrzejczykTHAT LEFT HOOK THO   UFC (@ufc) The Garden crowd roared in appreciation for a fairly monumental upset Through five previous title defenses Jedrzejczyk (14-1) had been building a legacy as one of the UFCs most dominant champions And at 30 shes not done yet But a star was born on this night and it was a 25-year-old out of Milwaukee Rose NamajunasExchanging blows here in the final round   UFC (@ufc) Half a year removed from his second straight unsuccessful challenge for the welterweight championship Thompson had some career rebuilding to do Its not fair that a draw and a tight loss to the champ knocks you down so many pegs but thats one of the cruelties of the fight gameAnd if thats what youre up against Masvidal is a good candidate to be your best dance partner  and perhaps your worst Hes going to fight you  hey he made his name as a street-fighting Kimbo Slice protg  and if you can fight him off you have a chance to impressMasvidal is no gatekeeper though He was ascending the 170-pound ranks himself until being derailed by a split-decision loss to Demian Maia in May Now he was trying to do some rebuilding of his own so he brought more caution to his game That helped make Round 1 a circle dance with Thompson landing more but not much of significance not even the front kick that put Masvidal on his rearRound 2 saw more fire especially after Masvidal blitzed with a takedown attempt and failing that threw a combination against the fence But Thompson (14-2-1) circled away and stepped up his striking game He floored Masvidal again this time with a hard right but never seemed close to a finish Even in Round 3 when Masvidal (32-13) was flinging punches that missed by a mile Thompson didnt play it safe He went for the finish and battered Masvidal to the final hornThey are SWINGING in round 1  UFC (@ufc) Youve got to wonder what went through the head of Hendricks every time he saw a UFC 217 fight poster and there was Georges St-Pierre staring back at him The last time GSP was in a UFC fight Hendricks brutalized him St-Pierre won a decision though to retain the welterweight belt that night back in 2013 but immediately afterward he walked away from the sport mentally bruised And within three months Hendricks was wearing 170-pound goldFour years later Bigg Rigg was in the main card curtain-jerker  deep beneath a St-Pierre main event  trying to resuscitate his career It didnt work out for him as Costa stalked him from the start and in the end was chasing him around the octagon with punches Hendricks (18-9) looked less like a middleweight than a welterweight who simply couldnt make weight while the big Brazilian was a dangerous AdonisCosta (11-0) had finished all but one of his previous 10 opponents in the first round nine by KO Hes a runaway train Hendricks represented a step up in competition and he put him away with confidenceMeanwhile Demetrious Mighty Mouse Johnson is in the building He seems excitedNow thats a duo  &  in the building for   UFC (@ufc) Johnson also got to meet New York Knicks star Kristaps Porzingis   NEW YORK KNICKS (@nyknicks)UFC President Dana White has pledged to donate $1 million on behalf of the mixed

ministers former secretary told The Mail on Sunday that Garnier gave her money to buy two vibrators at a Soho sex shop and called her a disparaging name in front of witnesses The facts of (the report) are in dispute so the Cabinet Office are going to look at it and see if there is a breach Hunt told ITVs Peston on Sunday programThe investigation comes as Britains political establishment faces increasing scrutiny over allegations of sexual harassment The soul-searching follows the scandal surrounding Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein who was fired after The New York Times published an expose that detailed decades of complaints against himEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove was forced to apologize Saturday after he attempted to joke about Weinstein during a radio interview Meanwhile women working in the British Parliament have reportedly created message groups to warn colleagues about harassmentHunt said Prime Minister Theresa May would be writing to the Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow to develop a plan to change the culture at Parliament I think people at home will be quite angry about this because a bit like the Harvey Weinstein stuff Parliament like Hollywood is very

redistributedIran and the United States on Sunday tore into each others behavior regarding the 2015 nuclear deal as Americas top diplomat and Irans supreme leader traded accusations of backsliding on agreed-to commitments Secretary of State Rex Tillerson acknowledged that Iran is in technical compliance with its obligations under the pact negotiated by the Obama administration and five other world powers But he faulted Tehran for its non-nuclear activities in the Middle East  backing militias in Yemen and Syria supporting terrorist groups and testing ballistic missilesWe have a lot of issues with Iran Tillerson said on CBSs Face the Nation Theyre a yard long The nuclear issue is one foot of that yard We have two feet of other issues that we must deal with And it has to do with Irans destabilizing activitiesFor his part Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei the ultimate power in Tehrans theocracy took to his English-language Twitter account to label Washington as in turn domineering bullying oppressive hounding and cruel  and corrupt and lying to bootEvery day US govt exposes a new side of its viciousness & proves Imam Khomeinis words true US govt is the great Satan he tweetedThe criticisms were lobbed at a critical moment for the  which eased economic sanctions in return for Iran agreeing to restrictions on its nuclear programIt is being kept alive for the time being after President Trump put aside his disdain for the deal on Thursday and waived US sanctions that were suspended under the agreement and must be revisited every 120 days If he hadnt the United States would have been in breach of its promisesBut the administration is still reviewing its policy toward Iran and the nuclear deal and Trump has said he is inclined to say next month that Iran is not complying with its commitments If he does Congress will have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions in effect breaking the US commitmentThe International Atomic Energy Agency has said eight times that Iran is complying with the deal officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action as Tillerson allowed on SundayThe administration contends that Iran is violating the spirit of the deal because in its preface it is stated that the nations negotiating it anticipate that full implementation of this JCPOA will positively contribute to regional and international peace and securityTillerson said that sentence explains in a nutshell why sanctions were liftedBut since the nuclear deal has been concluded what we have witnessed is Iran has stepped up its destabilizing activities in Yemen it stepped up its destabilizing activities in Syria and exports arms to Hezbollah and other terrorist groups and it continues to conduct a very active ballistic missile program Tillerson said None of that I believe is consistent with that preamble commitmentSupporters of the deal say it was never intended to solve every issue between the United States and Iran The diplomats who negotiated said at the time that the  because it was considered better to confront Tehran without the possibility of nuclear weaponsIran which has always denied seeking to build nuclear weapons has complained it has not received the economic benefits it expected from the deal because the United States has not done enough to convince the business community that it will remain in effect so long as Iran keeps its promisesIrans sense that it was shortchanged in the deal was behind a series of tweets by Khamenei on Sunday in between congratulating graduating police cadets and criticizing Aung San Suu Kyis silence on the plight of Burmas RohingyaCalling the US approach to the nuclear deal totally oppressive hounding & cruel in one tweet Khamenei in another tweet accused corrupt lying US officials of hypocrisyEnemies must know if bullying works elsewhere in world it wont work for Iran he said in another tweet Retreat has no place when it comes to our national interestsAnd he suggested that any move to decertify Irans compliance or withdraw from the deal will not go unansweredThe Iranian nation stands strongThe men who built the secret bomb factory had been clever  suspiciously so Bahraini investigators thought for a gang known mostly for lobbing molotov cocktails at police The underground complex had been hewed foot by foot beneath the floor of a suburban villa with no visible traces at street level and only a single entrance hidden behind a kitchen cabinetBut the real surprises lay inside In one room police found $20000 lathes and hydraulic presses for making armor-piercing projectiles capable of slicing through a tank Another held box upon box of the military explosive C-4 all of foreign origin in quantities that could sink a battleshipMost of these items have never been seen in Bahrain the countrys investigators said in a confidential technical assessment provided to US and European officials this past fall that offered new detail on the arsenals seized in the villa and in similar raids that have occurred sporadically over nearly three years In sheer firepower the report said the caches were both a game-changer and  matched against lightly armed police  overkillThe report a copy of which was shown to The Washington Post partly explains the growing unease among some Western intelligence officials over tiny Bahrain a stalwart US ally in the Persian Gulf and home to the Navys Fifth Fleet Six years after the start of a peaceful Shiite protest movement against the countrys Sunni-led government US and European analysts now see an increasingly grave threat emerging on the margins of the uprising heavily armed militant cells supplied and funded officials say by Iran  Signs of growing militancy have been cropping up for years with arrests of masked operatives planting roadside bombs and seizures of weapons and explosives smuggled into the country by land and sea But until recently Western officials have been cautious in accusing Iran of direct involvement in the unrest citing inconclusive or unreliable evidence as well as fears of further roiling sectarian tensions Bahrain a monarchy is majority Shiite but ruled by a Sunni minorityWhile Bahraini officials  the allegations often have been discounted as exaggerations by a monarchy that routinely cites terrorism as a justification for cracking down on Shiite activistsNow the Wests reluctance appears to be fading Despite credibility problems raised by Bahrains human rights record Western intelligence agencies are seeing a new boldness by Iran in supporting armed insurgents in the kingdom according to multiple analysts from the United States and two Western European governmentsDocuments and interviews with current and former intelligence officials describe an elaborate training program orchestrated by Tehrans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to school Bahraini militants in the techniques of advanced bombmaking and guerrilla warfare A wide variety of increasingly sophisticated weaponry  much of it forensically linked to Iran  has been discovered in Bahrain over the past three years including hundreds of pounds of military-grade explosives that almost certainly originated in Iran US and European intelligence officials say The efforts appear to mirror similar ongoing operations to build a network of pro-Tehran militant groups elsewhere in the Middle East from Yemen to Iraq and Syria several analysts saidWe are seeing more evidence of an Iranian destabilization effort said a US intelligence official with years of experience monitoring Bahrains civil and political unrest The official like several others interviewed insisted on anonymity in discussing sensitive intelligence from the regionBahrain sometimes overstates the facts the official added But this is real  The mounting evidence has prompted unprecedented steps by US and European governments targeting alleged leaders of Bahraini Shiite militant groupsOn March 16  a 27-year-old Shiite asylum seeker living in Berlin  under international warrants accusing him of being a terrorist operative for the al-Ashtar Brigades a Bahraini Shiite militant group that has claimed responsibility for deadly attacks against Bahraini police officersOn March 17 the State Department  finalizing an initiative begun during the final months of the Obama administration  imposed sanctions against two leaders of the same Bahraini group formally designating the men as global terrorists The official announcement specifically accused Iran of backing the group as part of its destabilizing and terrorism-related activities in the regionAnd on Wednesday the Trump administration moved to lift a freeze on the  reversing a decision made last year by the Obama administration to protest Bahrains outlawing of al-Wefaq the countrys main Shiite opposition party The White House action heavily criticized by human rights groups suggests a new willingness to overlook repressive behavior by key Gulf allies in the service of maintaining a strong defensive shield against future Iranian aggressionIn last months sanctions announcement the State Department sought to calibrate its message insisting that US officials would continue to press Bahrain to clearly differentiate its response to real terrorist threats from its dealings with peaceful demonstrators and political opposition groups But it flatly accused Tehran of intervening directly to make the problems worseIran has provided weapons funding and training to Bahraini militants it said Alluding perhaps to the sprawling US Navy facility that lies on the outskirts of Manama Bahrains capital city it noted that the global terrorist designation was reserved for individuals and groups that threaten the national security foreign policy or economy of the United StatesWhen the vast weapons cache was discovered beneath a villa in a predominantly Shiite neighborhood of the village of Nuwaidrat 18 months ago few outside the Persian Gulf seemed to notice Bahrains national police force displayed photographs of chemical drums and bags of white powder  proof in the words of Maj Gen Tariq al-Hassan the state police chief that relentless Iranian actions are attempting to undermine security and stability within Bahrain and the wider regionBut were the explosives real or were they a prop used to justify arrests of Shiite opposition leaders Bahraini officials had put on numerous such displays since February 2011 when the Sunni-led government sought to crush massive protests by the countrys Shiite majority with the help of tanks and thousands of troops dispatched into Manama from neighboring Arab countries  a former FBI counterterrorism analyst who has met with top Bahraini officials to discuss the weapons caches said chronic complaints about the countrys poor human rights record made it difficult for outsiders to assess whether the claims were real Were the allegations of Iranian interference a case of crying wolf or a wolf at the door he asked in an essay framing Bahrains dilemmaThe problem with Bahrain was that they had so little credibility that it was hard to separate what was real from what wasnt Levitt said in an interview But in the final analysis he said the evidence from weapons caches pointed to a real threat Iranian-sponsored terrorism In the case of Bahrain Levitt said there is some there there  Over the past year Bahraini officials have shown an increasing willingness to share evidence and seek outside scientific analysis to convince Western governments of the seriousness of the problem the country faces That effort led to a confidential assessment that was furnished to several intelligence agencies late last year Three US intelligence officials who have looked at the evidence said it broadly supports Bahrains claim of Iranian involvement in several recent attacks as well as in the arming of hardcore militant groupsThe dossier seen by The Post contains extensive technical reports assessing a small mountain of weaponry seized from Bahraini militants since 2013 including small arms grenades and ammunition bearing distinctive Iranian markings as well as Iranian-made electronics found inside improvised explosive devices The report catalogues staggering quantities of military-grade explosives including 418 pounds of C-4 an amount comparable to the quantity used by al-Qaeda to blast a 40-foot hole in  in 2000Chemical tests cited by the report showed that all the C-4  recovered from six locations over three years  came from two manufacturing lines that previous forensic analyses linked to Iran One of the six caches involved C-4 in its original Iranian military packaging the report saidBut Bahraini investigators were more troubled by the discovery of the expensive hydraulic presses and metal lathes in the underground bomb factory in the village of Nuwaidrat At least $35000 worth of Chinese- and Italian-made metalworking equipment had been smuggled into the house to craft expertly made explosively formed projectiles or EFPs a kind of improvised bomb designed to blast through military armor The unfinished bombs recovered from the villa bore designs identical to those used by Iranian-supplied Shiite insurgents to attack US troops in Iraq the analysis saidThis dramatically upgrades Bahraini terrorist capabilities to conduct more lethal and effective attacks the analysis said This level of advancement is highly unlikely to have been reached without outside support guidance and trainingThe report called the existence of such devices in Bahrain deeply puzzling noting that the firepower far exceeded what would be required to blow up the ordinary police cruisers and unarmored transports used by Bahraini patrols One plausible use for the EFPs would be to destroy tanks and troop carriers dispatched from neighboring Gulf countries in the event of a future conflict Or perhaps the bombmakers and their sponsors had an entirely different goal in mind the report said to inflict grave damage to US forces and facilitiesWhatever their intended purpose powerful EFPs have not been used anywhere in Bahrain up to now Militant groups have used smaller bombs and assault rifles to strike police and security forces and in a highly coordinated attack in January to stage a prison breakout that briefly freed several prominent militant leadersAgainst the backdrop of steady if low-bore violence the rhetoric is intensifying on all sides In late March Bahrain announced it had disrupted a militant plot to assassinate government officials and carry out a string of attacks targeting local police and the US Navy base A police spokesman cited intercepted communications between local cell leaders and alleged supporters and co-conspirators in Iran  Bahrain has continued to draw international criticism over its repression of political dissent  groups and  issued reports last year accusing Bahrains authorities of systematically harassing and imprisoning peaceful protesters and of torturing and even killing several detaineesIn response Bahraini officials point to ongoing efforts to institute political reforms including the appointment of an independent ombudsman to weigh complaints of mistreatment leveled by Shiite opposition groups Were doing more on human rights than any neighbor within a thousand miles of us and were being punished for opening up and dealing with our problems a senior Bahraini official complained wearilyIran meanwhile although it has not acknowledged supplying weapons to Bahraini militants has allowed resistance leaders to operate openly in Tehran and has expressed solidarity with opposition calls for ending Bahrains Sunni monarchy In March 2016 senior Revolutionary Guard commander Saeed Qassimi publicly called Bahrain an Iranian province separated from Iran as a result of colonialism adding that Iran is now a base for the support of revolution in BahrainIncreasingly there are words to go along with the deeds which indicates that they are trying to signal something Dont mess with us or we can hurt you said Michael Knights an analyst on Middle Eastern military and security affairs for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy a nonpartisan think tankKnights who extensively investigated Irans backing of Shiite insurgents during the Iraq War saw echoes in Bahrain of Irans practice of supplying tank-crushing EFPs to Iraqi Shiite militias which used the devices in an effort to create no-go zones around Shiite strongholds The fact that the EFPs havent been used in Bahrain could mean that local authorities have found all of them he said Or it could suggest something more sinisterIt could be that theyre being withheld for another time Knights said or for another set of circumstancesThe Trump administration escalated its rhetoric against North Korea on Sunday warning that time is running out for a peaceful solution between Kim Jong Uns regime and the United States and its alliesAdministration officials said the risk from North Koreas nuclear weapons program is rising and they underscored that President Trump will confront the looming crisis at the UN General Assembly this week Trump who spoke by phone with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Saturday referred to Kim on Twitter as  and asserted that long gas lines are forming in the North because of recent UN sanctions on oil imports  Though Trumps top aides emphasized that the administration is examining all diplomatic measures to rein in Pyongyang they made clear that military options remain on the tableIf North Korea keeps on with this reckless behavior if the United States has to defend itself or defend its allies in any way North Korea will be destroyed Nikki Haley the US ambassador to the United Nations said Sunday on CNNs State of the Union None of us want that None of us want war But we also have to look at the fact that you are dealing with someone [in Kim] who is being reckless irresponsible and is continuing to give threats not only to the United States but to all of its allies So something is going to have to be doneThe question remains however how realistic the Trump administrations threats are as the North quickly advances its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities Trumps latest tweets came two weeks after North Korea tested a nuclear device that experts said measured at 250 kilotons 17times the force of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in World War II  Trump warned Kim last month that the North would feel the fire and fury of the United States if the regime continued its threats and destabilized the Korean Peninsula and East AsiaBut Kim promptly responded with new threats and a round of new weapons testsTrump is scheduled to join Moon and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at a working lunch Thursday in New York on the sidelines of the UN meetings to discuss North Korea White House aides said Yet Trump will not have the opportunity to meet with Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia both leaders are skipping the annual gatheringLast week Haley touted the UN sanctions on the North saying that if enacted they would cut off 30percent of oil imports and curtail 90percent of Kims exports putting a major economic pinch on a government that has long struggled to provide for the nations estimated 25million peopleYet Trump said last week that he and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are skeptical that the sanctions will have a significant impact on North Koreas nuclear ambitions Administration officials reaffirmed the United States long-standing policy that the North must agree to relinquish its nuclear arsenal as a prerequisite for direct diplomatic talksHes going to have to give up his nuclear weapons because the president has said that he is not going to tolerate this regime threatening the United States and our citizens with a nuclear weapon national security adviser HR McMaster said on ABCs This WeekTrump McMaster added has been very clear about that that all options are on the tableAt the same time the administration signaled that it is not pursuing regime change a position that could help persuade Beijing to play a stronger role in pressuring Kim China facilitates about 90percent of North Koreas trade and provides its oilYet Tillerson said North Korea does not appear to be interested in denuclearization talksIm waiting for the regime in North Korea to give us some indication that theyre prepared to have constructive productive talks he said on CBSs Face the NationWe have tried a couple of times to signal to them that were ready when theyre ready Tillerson added and they responded with more missile launches and a nuclear test All they need to do to let us know theyre ready to talk is to just stop these tests stop these provocative actions and lets lower the threat level and the rhetoricMany US allies in Europe and elsewhere are strongly opposed to any use of force that could further destabilize the Korean Peninsula and East Asia The two unanimous UN Security Council votes for sanctions in recent weeks have marked a new level of alarm from those allies as well as Moscow and Beijing  But McMaster said Washington isnt assuming the sanctions will work or buy timeWe all have our doubts about whether or not thats going to be enough he said and so we have to prepare all options We have to make sure all options are under development to ensure that this regime cannot threaten the world with a nuclear weaponAnalysts have said the North has shown rapid improvements in its ballistic missile and nuclear technologies Recent missile tests have demonstrated the range to potentially strike the continental United States along with the technical capacity to mount a miniature nuclear device on a missile analysts saidThat has accelerated the urgency in Washington at the White House and on Capitol Hill Asked on CNN whether the Trump administration should continue to deny the North diplomatic talks until it ends its nuclear program Sen Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif) a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee said noI think that North Korea is not going to give up its program with nothing on the table she said I think that what could happen is that we could have reliable verification of a freeze of both the nuclear program and the missile arsenal and that we could conceivably talk China into supporting that kind of a freeze because it would carry with it no regime change and no war Carol Morello in Washington contributed to this reportRepublicans are poised to begin debating details of their tax plan this week but House Speaker Paul D Ryan (R-Wis) signaled Sunday that party leaders are still mulling whether to use the proposal to end a central element of the Obama-era Affordable Care ActThe tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee is set to begin reviewing the GOP plan on Monday in public hearings that could stretch into Thursday But significant differences remain and new proposals could be added Ryan signaled that a  is still up for discussion while a key New York Republican warned that he and other GOP lawmakers from highly taxed northeastern states remain opposed to the legislationAppearing on Fox News Sunday Ryan said that repealing the individual mandate is one of the things thats being discussedWere listening to our members about what we can do to add to this bill to make it even better he added  Despite the research and Trumps pleas House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex) said Friday that he is unlikely to add changes to health-care policy to the  because doing so would doom its chances in the more closely divided Senate Meanwhile Rep Peter T King (R-NY) told ABCs This Week that the tax plan as written would have a particularly devastating effect on New York which has some of the highest local and state taxes in the countryAs of now I would have to vote against the plan King said He also lobbed a veiled shot at the White House saying that in his Long Island-area swing district The main objection Im getting is from Trump voters who have voted for Democratic presidents in the pastYou would have my voters my constituents subsidizing other states in the country New York does subsidize the rest of the country already I just want to work this right now If its worked out I support almost everything else in the bill he saidKing was among 20 House Republicans who withheld support for a budget resolution last month that set the rules for the forthcoming tax debate King and many of the others voted no because GOP leaders were planning to eliminate deductions for state and local taxes In a bid to win their support the bill unveiled last week would allow taxpayers to deduct up to $10000 in property taxesRep Tom MacArthur (R-NJ) who also voted against the budget resolution on Sunday called the $10000 cap a huge win for middle-class taxpayers even in high-tax states like mineA $10000 property tax cap covers the vast majority of people in my state in my congressional district he told Fox News Channels Sunday Morning Futures adding that he now plans to support the tax plan  Other conservatives on Sunday expressed support for the tax overhaul Failure is not an option Rep Mark Meadows (R-NC) chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus told ABC calling the tax plan a work in progress that would ultimately lead to long-term economic growth despite adding $15trillion to the deficitThe preliminary numbers really look very good in terms of economic growth Meadows said adding that growth will outweigh any short-term deficit increaseAnother conservative Sen James Lankford (R-Okla) said he remains concerned about how much the GOP plan could add to the debtThis is something thats been a behind-the-scenes conversation for a long time Its one thing to be able to cut taxes its another thing to be able to say How are we going to deal with our debt and deficit So my main focus has been  whatever economic growth model we put in place has to be reasonable to be able to do it Lankford told NBCs Meet the PressRyan said he still expects the House to complete its work on the bill by Thanksgiving and said We expect our friends in the Senate to be about a week behind usThe Senate is poised to release its own version of a tax overhaul in the coming days possibly as early as this week News reports last week suggested that the Senates tax plan would propose phasing in a new corporate tax rate of 20 percent over five years instead of immediately But in an interview on Fox News Channel Vice President Pence said the new corporate tax rate has to happen immediately And were going to drive and drive hardWe got to do it quickly so businesses  will be able to invest growth dollars in wages and hiring more employees Pence told Sunday Morning FuturesPence said he expects all negotiations between House and Senate leaders to be completed in time for Trump to sign a final tax plan by mid-DecemberDemocrats meanwhile rejected the GOP plan House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif) described the proposal as a Ponzi scheme and a gift to corporate America   They spread out a banquet for the wealthiest Americans and threw some crumbs to the middle class Pelosi said on CNNs State of the UnionShe also accused Republicans of rushing their plan and implied that they had not adequately researched its effects before proposing it The plan was crafted at the speed of light in the dark of night she said  Caitlin Dewey contributed to this reportSet aside the  and the  in New York City Starting this weekend President Trump will in theory put domestic issues on the back burner as heembarks uponan important series of state visits in AsiaTrumps tour will begin in Japan with a golf outing with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Sunday followed by meetings in Tokyo and then further stops in South Korea China Vietnam and the Philippines It will be the longest trip taken by any US president since George HW Bush traveled throughAsia in 1991 and ended the journey by  during dinner Officials in the White House are surely hoping for no such messes this timeIn each country Trump will have a fair amount of work to do In Vietnam and the Philippines hell attend two key regional summits where Americas many allies in the region are hoping to hear the reassuringwords of a traditional American president rather than Trumps campaign-trail barking questioning Washingtons long-standing overseas commitmentsTrumps advisers have outlined three guiding themes to the tripa tough line on North Koreas nuclear threat a commitment to an open and free Indo-Pacific region (or rather a checkon Chinese maritime pushiness) and a reckoning with Asian partners over what Trump sees as unfair trade deficits Meanwhile heres what the world is wondering about Trumps journeyGiven Trumps propensity for abrasive tweets and unscripted rants the first concern for some of his protocol team would be the risk of causing offense in President Barack Obama once courted controversy by merely chewing gum while arriving at a 2014 summit in Beijing Trumps plannedaudiencewith Japans emperor may come under particular scrutinyThe president will use whatever language he wants to use said national security adviser HR McMaster at a Thursday press briefingwhen asked whether Trump would curb his sometimes incendiary rhetoricTrump seems to be at least aware of such worries I dont want to embarrass anybody four days before I land in China Trump said at a Cabinet meeting this weekend after heagain complained about bad trade deals with certain countriesTrump has hosted Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and boasted of cultivating a good rapport with both leaders But it remains to be seen whether such bonhomie can pay dividends on a grander scaleIn Japan Trump has a much easier missionAbe a notably hawkish nationalist is happy with Trumps eagerness to sell more arms to American allies in the region Trumps arrival will be preceded by  when shell address the Japanese governments World Assembly of Women conferenceIn China though Trump may face a more complicated showdownThe American president is expected to lean heavily on his Chinese counterpart to get Beijing toeconomically and politically isolateNorth Korea while hes also likely to clash with Xi over their differences on tradeI think the sense that one gets is that privately most likely  [Trump] will effectively tell Xi Jinping Im coming after you on trade especially   And I think the Chinese because of that concern are very eager to use the summit meeting to try to press the reset button on the relationshipbetween the two presidentsPyongyangs nuclear threat will loom over most of Trumps deliberations in East Asia But the question remains What will he actually do about it So far despite Trumps saber-rattling tweets USactions have been   that is pursuing a tough regime of international sanctions that may compel the North Koreans to come to the tableBut any diplomatic effort will require a united front with a host of countries with varying interests Trumps main job may be to figure out what the next steps might beBeyond pushing China to implement the sanctions already in place and perhaps getting them to introduce a few more one option would be to bring Korea Japan and Russia back into the conversation suggestsIn this case five heads may well be better than twoOther analysts are more skeptical Michael Auslin of the Hoover Institutethinks that North Koreans will never surrender their nuclear weapons program and after successive presidents have failed to stopPyogyangsnuclear buildup that this White House needs to learn how to live with thatWhat the president should do is simple if radical He should admit the failure of Americas North Korea policy since the 1990s and abandon the fantasy of complete verifiable and irreversible denuclearization Instead he should acknowledge that North Korea is a nuclear weapons-capable state and that the United States will treat it as such That means revamping US policy toward explicit containment and deterrence of a nuclear North KoreaPerhaps the biggest question looming over Trumps trip iswhat rolethe America First president will playnot only in bilateral meetings with leaderssuch as Abe and Xi but at regional summitssuch as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting

Cooperation Council (GCC) are incendiary comments attributed to Qatars Emir Tamim at a military graduation ceremony May 23A report  on the Qatar News Agency (QNA) website later that day alleged that the emir stated that Qatar had a tense relationship with President Trumps administration described Hamas as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and called Iran a big power in the stabilization of the region Qatar TV  the emirs alleged speech on its evening news program before the government communications office claimed  belatedly on May 24  that the QNA website had been hacked and false statements posted on itRegardless of whether they were made or fabricated  and people present at the military graduation insist that the emir made no speech whatsoever  Tamims remarks caused immediate  in regional media much of it based in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates Both countries  Al Jazeera and other Qatar-based media outlets in the aftermath of the allegations and new articles have been published daily in the week since Almost without exception each article has taken the emirs speech as fact and proceeded on that basis to accuse Qatar of being the weak link in the threat to regional stability from Iran and terrorism  and to demand that Qatar choose sides between the GCC and IranThe ferocity and the sheer scale of the Qatar-bashing articles suggest that an orchestrated campaign is underway to discredit Doha regionally but also  crucially  in the eyes of the Trump administrationThis comes three years after a nine-month standoff between Qatar and three of its neighbors  Saudi Arabia the UAE and Bahrain  rocked the six-member GCC In the time since Tamim and Abu Dhabis influential crown prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed exchanged  and Qatars  to deploy 1000 soldiers to Yemen in September 2015 seemed to indicate that the 2014 upheaval was a thing of the past What then has changed and why has a seemingly dormant dispute suddenly flared up again and in such a visceral mannerA convergence of factors appears to have shifted the geopolitical landscape in the Persian Gulf The Trump administration  that it intends to follow a set of regional policies that are aligned far closer to those of Abu Dhabi and Riyadh than Doha Both Mohammed bin Zayed and Saudi Arabias Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman were high-profile  to Washington in the run-up to the Riyadh summit with Arab and Islamic leadersFurther the policy inexperience of many within Trumps inner circle has presented an opportunity for both the Saudis and the Emiratis to shape the administrations thinking on critical regional issues such as Iran and Islamism both of which were evident during the Riyadh visitWhereas the Obama administration sought to enhance US engagement with the GCC as a bloc Trump focused instead on Saudi Arabia and the UAE as the twin pillars of its regional approach Strong bonds  have formed between Trumps adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia as well as Yusuf al-Otaiba the influential UAE ambassador inWashingtonKey principals within the Trump administration such as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and CIA Director Mike Pompeo  on Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood that are virtually indistinguishable from those in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi Saudi Arabia and the UAE are emerging as the two spearheads around which US regional policies are realigning including a set of hawkish defense and security interests the joint raid conducted by US and UAE Special Forces in Yemen in January may well be only the first of numerous joint initiatives across regional conflict zones in the months and years aheadWhatever signals may (or may not) have been passed in private there has been a noticeable increase in domestic and regional assertiveness in the immediate aftermath of Trumps Saudi trip In Bahrain the  by security forces on opposition forces since 2011 resulted in five deaths just two days after Trump assured the Bahraini king of a new era in bilateral relationsThe Saudi-Emirati media campaign against Qatar happened to coincide with a high-profile event in Washington where analysts and former senior US officials  on Qatars reliability as a regional security partner Ruling circles in Persian Gulf capitals may feel emboldened by the new political climate to see how far they can go in pursuit of hawkish domestic and regional policies and what if any pushback they encounterThere are differences between this latest disagreementand the past  not least in the way the current standoff is being played out in the media rather than behind the closed doors of leaders meetings  and no act equivalent to the withdrawal of the ambassadors In fact few officials have publicly joined the feeding frenzy and have been careful not to single Qatar out by name in calling for brotherly unity against the Iranian The carefully controlled public spaces in GCC states mean it is inconceivable that such attacks on a fellow member state could have been made without at the very least a degree of official sanction behind the scenes By allowing the media campaign to run into a second week with no apparent letup policymakers in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi may be hoping to pressure the leadership in Doha into making concessions or watching to see whether figures within the Trump administration take the bait without having to resort to official threats or sanctions Where this leaves the GCC as an entity in the age of Trump is anyones guessTomorrow Iran will hold its 12th presidential election The election  a two-man race between incumbent President Hassan Rouhani the centrist-reformist candidate and Ebrahim Raisi the candidate closest to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei In the past week  show Rouhani over the 50 percent threshold he needs to win but also show thatalmost 50 percent of voters are either undecided or dont express their preferenceThe election results are anything but a foregone conclusion Those who call these elections  will continue to miss both the intricate politics on display and the underlying issues that inform themThis is the first election after the death of former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in January Rafsanjani and another former president Mohammad Khatami established a moderate coalition  supported by a wide range of political parties  to oppose hard-liners gradually becoming a diverse power block This coalition led to Rouhanis surprising presidential victory in 2013 as well as successful candidates in parliamentary elections  But some say that Rafsanjani was merely using the reformists in his power struggle with Khamenei Now the reformists could improve their relationship with Khamenei directly without having to go through Rafsanjani In the weeks that followed Rafsanjanis death Eshaq Jahangiri  the current vice president who  for president Tuesday  met with Khamenei and  that he would act as the link between the leader and the reformistsAs the leader of the reformists Khatami also called for a  to publicly bring together reformists and hard-liners together against the possibility of external threats Khamenei rejected this idea and  he saw no need for it While these are weak signs Khameneis victory over the reformists over the past decade may have given him the confidence to open up some kind of rapprochement in the futureWith rumors surrounding the health of the 78-year-old Khamenei political actors in Iran have begun to consider his possible successor Based on the makeup of its executive committee the current Assembly of Experts  which could choose the next supreme leader  is closely aligned with Khamenei Khamenei had been a two-term president and a member of the Assembly of Experts when chosen as leader in 1989  an experience that parallels RouhanisKhameneis death would end his control over an Assembly of Experts that contains many clerics that came to power in 2016 through the Rafsanjani/Khatami-engineered reformist-centrist alliance enabling a Rouhani run for the leadership positionFor the central command of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) its important that when there is a change in leadership in Iran the reformists not gain significant power A second term for Rouhani poses a threat to them This explains why the IRGC backed the candidacy of Raisi the trustee of one of the richest religious sites in the Shiite world who has held important positions in the judiciary and is a member of the Assembly of Experts Raisi represents the most radical religious parts of Iran and those most loyal to KhameneiIf he becomes the next president Raisi will be well positioned to become Khameneis successor In that case his proximity to the leadership and his position in the assembly may even create a situation like that of  where the successor became the face of the countrys leadership even though the leader was still alive and in powerBut the same dynamic applies to Rouhani who will lose his chance of becoming the next leader if he loses the presidential election no matter who controls the next administration However if he wins by more than 20 million votes Rouhani will be in a strong position for leadership in a post-Khamenei IranIrans unemployment crisis is the single most important campaign issue this election Rouhanis opponents use it to  of Irans post-nuclear agreement economy While the economic crisis is real  and its roots go further back than the nuclear issue  no candidate regardless of their political leaning will be in a position to solve it in a short time spanTo pivot away from this insoluble problem Rouhani stepped up his criticism of political repression He  to lift house arrests on the leaders of the Green Movement Rouhani also used campaign speeches to  this election to the one that gave birth to the reform movement when Iranians elected Khatami in 1997Rouhani also  the IRGC for its  attacks on the Saudi embassy and its provocations in the region as the reason for the lowlevel of investments in Irans economy and by extension the unemployment crisisBy embracing the reform movement Rouhani hopes to mobilize his base and convince those who are on the sidelines to vote for him tomorrow While his rise in polls show this to be a short-term strategy to win the election it may have the longer-term effect of breaking up the reformist-centrist alliance that has been so successful since 2013As Rouhani leans further into reformist rhetoric he may alienate the center and right-leaning blocs in the coalition  groups that have a longer history of conflict than alliance The death of Rafsanjani who alone had significant pull among these groups would mean that should the coalition break its chances of repair are very lowThis more than any other reason may explain why the most silent man in this election has been none other than the supreme leaderSomeone asked me a very simple question Monday night Whats the biggest pay for in the Republican tax planIts akey question for Thursday when we get to that President Trump and congressional Republicans have been working on for months As businesses big and small cheer lower tax rates who will pay more to make those changes happenBased on what we know right nowthe biggest pay for is debt  American taxpayers of tomorrow will pay a substantial portion of the bill for lower corporate taxes today Republicans who bemoaned Americas $20 trillion debt for years have now approved to the nationaldebt to pay for (ie borrow for) tax cutsThis move is a sharp reversal from previous Republican promises of revenue-neutral tax reform wrote the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget in a memo FridayHeres the basic math CFRB estimates the for the entire tax package is $58 trillion over 10 years meaning about a quarter of the bill will come from debt financing The rest is supposed to come from someone (or some business) paying more but so far Republicans have struggled to identify who that will beRepublicans needmore than $4 trillion in revenue raisers over a decade In September theyoutlined measuresthat could raise up to$36 trillion but many of those ideas arent going over well with the public  or even some GOP lawmakers The tax writers in the House Ways and Means Committee huddled late in the night on Halloween to they can agree onMany fear the final bill will fall substantially short of paying for itself without accounting gimmicksThe bottom line it seems is that the big tax cut that the administration would like cant be sold with only the money-back guarantee that it will pay for itself So the administration has to raise taxes to cut taxes wrote economist Ed Yardeni president of Yardeni Research in his morning note Wednesday  The general principle of tax is that the government lowers the tax rates but it also broadens the base at the same time Instead this bill is looking more and more like a traditional tax cutTheres a lot of nostalgia for the 1986 tax reform under President Reagan The final bill  which nearly died many times over political infighting  lowered rates on individual American taxpayers It also lowered corporate rates but the entire bill was fully paid for because politicians did the hard work of eliminating a lot of corporate tax deductions Alan Auerbach director of the Burch Center for Tax Policy and Public Finance at the University of California at Berkeley refers to the 1986 bill as a tax hike on corporations not a cutIn 1986 corporations basically footed the bill forindividual tax cuts Its shaping up to be the reverse this time aroundThe biggest pay for in the plan was supposed to be eliminating deductions especially the state and local tax deduction (SALT) that is popular in high-tax (and mostly Democratic) states like New York California and New Jersey Eliminating SALT would raise $13 trillion over a decade a sizable amount But Republican members of Congress from many coastal states have threatened to  and the GOP cant afford to lose more than23 GOPvotes in the House andtwo in the Senate  Another pay for is getting rid of the personal exemption and the exemption for children (or dependents) But its hard to call this a true pay for since Republicans use much of the money raised from repealing this exemption to pay for a doubling of the standard deduction The net effect is less than $1 trillion in savingsIf you are keeping track the math isnt adding up to $4 trillion Its why the GOP has been trying new ideas Last weekRep Kevin Brady (R-Tex) chair of the House Ways and Means Committee that writes the tax bills said hewas considering changes to Brady didnt lay out any specifics but one option GOP leaders were reportedly considering wouldcut the annual amount Americans can put in a 401(k) tax-free from $18000 to $2400 The backlash was quickMore than 63 million Americans have an active 401(k) plan People were upset and so was the financial industry Trump himself weighed in Among the easiestways to generate some much needed cash for the bill would be to tax the rich more (or to not lower their taxes in the first place) It would enable the GOP to do the corporate rate cutting they want and also give the middle class a little something extra It might even win  for the final packageNot repealing the estate tax which only estates worth over $459 million pay would save$269 billion over a decade according to Joint Committee on Taxation Not cutting the top tax rate of 396 percent which applies to individuals makingmore $418400 a year (and married couples making over$470700) would save about $265 billion over a decade according to Tax Policy Center Republicans are finally looking at ways to tax the rich AsThe Washington Post reported Tuesday evening Republicansnow plan on keeping the  at least onfamilies earning at least $750000 to $1 million Its a high bar but its a sign tax cuts for everyone justdont add upThe question is whos paying for the rest of the tabDonald Trump and Corey A Stewart had never met before the front-runner for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination held a rally in Manassas early this month But people who know the longtime chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors say it makes perfect sense that Trump tapped him this week to chair his Virginia campaign  Like Trump Stewart is a blunt and outspoken Republican advocate of cracking down on illegal immigration A local law he championed that allows county police to check the immigration status of anyone they arrest made him a pariah to liberal Democrats and advocacy groups especially after Virginia officials approved a statewide law with the same provisions a year laterStewart  who last month was elected to a third term  has been unapologetic Theres some obvious similarities between the two said Geoffrey Skelley associate editor of the University of Virginia Center for Politics Crystal Ball newsletter The overall hard-line position on illegal immigration  that definitely jibesStewarts county is a presidential bellwether for Virginia an increasingly purple state that is considered a must-win for whoever will next occupy the White House It is home to a growing number of Latinos and Muslims who are rallying against Trump as well as a sizable number of white middle-class voters a demographic that has been drawn to the billionaire developers pledge to fix the economy and make America great againWhat remains to be seen is whether Stewart can shepherd the enthusiasm that was on display for Trump at the Manassas rally into a victory in the March1 Republican presidential primary and  if Trump wins the nomination  a general-election defeat of the likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton  Clinton is building her own strong network of support in the state led by her close friend Gov Terry McAuliffe Trump an anti-establishment candidate who is leading the polls but has yet to secure an endorsement from a major Republican leader has little in Virginia in terms of a campaign organization and ground gameStewart said the fact that hes a well-known board chairman in one of the states largest counties gives Trump a boost in a crowded Republican field Stewarts role could also help his own statewide profile as he considers a run for governor in 2017 He unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor in 2013I think what my position brings is some additional credibility that there are elected officials who say they are supporting him who think he can win even in a place like Northern Virginia Stewart said His message is really resonating hereAt the rally on Dec2 supporters cheered loudly waved signs and jumped up and down as Trump derided his opponents as weak or unfit and promised to build a 1000-mile-long wall along the US-Mexico border Hes a real leader who says what he means said DB Bailey a Gainesville residentStewart said he was taken aback by the size and enthusiasm of the crowd at the rally at the Prince William County Fairgrounds I havent seen that much excitement for a Republican candidate ever not in my political lifetime at least Stewart said Since Ronald Reagan there really hasnt been a candidate that has generated the amount of enthusiasm that Donald Trump has generated  One reason analysts say is that voters in Prince William are concerned about some of the same issues that have propelled Trump to the top of national polls Federal sequestration cuts hit the county hard in recent years hurting federal government workers contractors and other residentsAlthough unemployment in the county has steadily declined since 2010 (the current rate is 42percent) the median household income has stayed below $100000 US Census Bureau estimates show  considerably less than in neighboring Loudoun and Fairfax counties The number of residents collecting food stamps has increased by 41percent since 2010Prince William is also home to demographic changes that have unsettled longtime mostly white residents who say they are worried about terrorism and other violent crime Latinos make up about 21percent of the countys 430000 residents and Muslims are approaching 7percent of the populationTrump has referred to undocumented Latino immigrants as rapists and killers and he proposes a temporary ban on all Muslim immigrants entering the United StatesTrump is relating to people like a New York cabdriver said Del Bob Marshall (R-Prince William) who said he is undecided on whom hell support in the primary Hes just talking at a very basic level and it connects with a bunch of peopleBut the countys changing landscape could also work against Trump and Stewart  or so Democrats hopeHarry W Wiggins chairman of the Prince William Democrats and a longtime critic of Stewart called the men two peas in a pod and described Stewarts approach to illegal immigration as the Trump plan of 2007Just like Trump he plays on peoples fear Wiggins said   Rafi Ahmed who oversees government affairs for the Muslim Association of Virginia said Stewarts alignment with Trump may damage what has been a good working relationship between the county board chair and area MuslimsStewart says he disagrees with Trumps idea for a ban against Muslims and hopes to bridge relations between that community and the developer But Ahmed said Stewarts effort to help Trump become president is very troublesome for many Muslim community membersThere is an atmosphere of fear among community members and this exacerbates their fears Ahmed said People dont know what to expectLuis Aguilar an activist in Prince William with the Casa in Action advocacy group for immigrants said the pairing of Trump and Stewart will bring new energy to his organizations efforts to increase the Latino vote on behalf of Democratic candidatesAnother advocacy group People for the American Way used Trump in political ads to rally support for Prince William Democrat Jeremy McPike who beat Republican Harry J Hal Parrish II in a hard-fought state Senate raceHaving them both in the same sentence Aguilar said of Stewart and Trump The community knows who they are and what they stand for which is completely against all of our valuesTrump administration officials are contemplating an executive order that would call for  Its a deeply provocative move that worriesa wide spectrum of  and counterterrorism analysts My colleague Karen DeYoung has already delved into  an institution at the heart of the regime in Tehran So well stick with the Muslim Brotherhood an organization founded in Egypt in 1928 that espouses a brand of political Islam Its a broad transnational Sunni Muslim movement with loosely connected analogues in dozens of countriesFor a tumultuous couple of years the Muslim Brotherhood sat at theapex of power in Egypt Its candidate Mohamed Morsi won the countrys 2012 presidential election but he and his allies were swept from power by a military coup the following year Top leaders werejailed and sentenced to death while the post-coup regime embarked on a ruthless crackdown that effectively drove theBrotherhoodback underground They see it as a dangerous jihadist front that inspired Hamas the Palestinian Islamist party that is already on the State Departments list of designated terror groups Once-fringefigures like White Housechief strategist Stephen K Bannonhave   and   about Muslim Brotherhood agents in America working toward an Islamic takeover of the RepublicNow Bannonand other hardline ideologues  have the ear of the White House and are keen on bringing their agenda to bear But the plan to designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization generates a host of problemsTwo previous administrations havedeclined to designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terror group A recent review conducted by the British government arrived at the same conclusion The organization renounced violence decades ago in favor of attempting to push its Islamist views through politicsDesignating the Muslim Brotherhood a foreign terrorist organization would wrongly equate it with violent extremist groups like Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State and make their otherwise lawful activities illegal said Laura Pitter senior US national security counsel at Human Rights Watch Even noted critics of the Muslim Brotherhood like  of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think designating it a terrorist organization makes littlesenseThese are not good guys These are not moderate politicians They support on an ideological level terrorism They cooperate with terrorists They give a platform for terrorists Trager  The Muslim Brotherhood could not control Egypt  where it is from where it has existed for over 80 years and where it could not keep control for more than a year It sure as hell is not going to take over AmericaThere is literally not a single US expert on the Muslim Brotherhood that Im aware of who supports designating it as a terrorist group Shadi Hamid (@shadihamid) An  published last month warned that listingthe Muslim Brotherhood which has potentially millions of adherents in the Middle East and North Africa as a terror group would fuel extremismA US designation would probably weaken MB leaders arguments against violence and provide ISIS and al-Qaeda additional grist for propaganda to win followers and support particularly for attacks against US interests  which was obtained by PoliticoShadi Hamid a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution said a designation wouldfeed into ISIS propaganda that the West seeks conflict with Islam writ large and vindicates the ISIS narrative that working within state structures is a fools errand for IslamistsIf the groupis listed as a terror organization the ruling would implicate anyone connected to any sort of Muslim Brotherhood activities as complicit interrorism This would cast a cloud over a number of US-based charities and civil rights organizationsthat haveindirect ties to Muslim Brotherhood-related groups abroadIt would also have a chilling effect on Muslim Americans in

assistance to the Brotherhood without any intent to support terrorist activity  a Washington-based civil rights lawyer  as even the most remote connection to the Brotherhood could pass muster in a court of lawHe concludes An executive order on the Brotherhood should be called out for what it is  an attempt to silence dissent and terrify Muslim and Arab communitiesKey argument against designating Muslim Brotherhood terrorist org is that it isnt one Stop using terrorism for everything you dont like Peter R Neumann (@PeterRNeumann) TheMuslim Brotherhood is a vast entity withoffshootsembedded in the political life of countries from Morocco to Jordan to Turkey whose ruling party sees itself as a cousin of the Brotherhood A terror designation risks provoking a host of allies the USneeds in the messy geopolitics of the Middle EastItwould signal [the White House is]more interested in provoking conflict with an imaginary fifth column of Muslims in the US than in

Obamapitting Americans against each other refers to  visit to mosque says latest example of his constant pitting people against each other I cant stand that Mike Memoli (@mikememoli) Others criticized Obama for  and  And late Wednesday night Donald Trump said perhaps Obama  -- a comment thick with innuendo from a man who championed conspiracy theories about Obamas birthplaceWe have a lot of problems in this country Greta Trump said on Greta Van Susterens Fox News show There are a lot of places he can go and he chose a mosqueJeb Bush on the other hand argued  And as weve discussed before his brother George W Bush would likely agree The elder Bush after all visited a mosque shortly after the Sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks with a message pretty similar to ObamasThe Post In a gesture that surprised and gratified Islamic leaders Bush stepped up an already intense effort by his administration to prevent hate crimes and discrimination against nearly 10 million American Arabs and Muslims in retaliation for the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks by Middle Eastern terroristsThe face of terror is not the true faith of Islam said the president escorted by Islamic clerics into the ornate mosque full of Turkish tile Persian rugs and Egyptian paintings Islam is peaceSo why is something a Republican president did in 2001 suddenlydivisive when a Democratic president does it 15 years laterRubio is free to enunciate why that is -- and it could definitely have something to do with Obama singling out Republicans in the speech and his refusal to say the words radical Islam (though Rubio didnt mention those things in ) -- but more broadly Islam is simply something that gives an increasing number of Republicans heartburnThe  in 2002 showed 47 percent of Republicans and independents who leaned Republican said either most or half/some Muslims are anti-AmericanToday that number is now 63 percentJust 3 in 10 Republicans say the number of anti-American Muslims is only just a few or none Think about that for a moment and its not hard to see why many Republicans rallied to Donald Trumps proposed ban on Muslim immigrantsPew has a raft of other data showing GOP voters are significantly more suspicious of how violent a religion Islam is and are much more likely to say that politicians shouldnt be afraid ofsaying things that might be seen as critical of IslamBut the chart above shows better than just about anything else how much more polarized we are on this issue Call it the Trump Effect Call it a symptom of how Americans now consume their news and information Call it a reaction to the rise of the Islamic StateWhatever it is it is much more pitched than it was even after the 9/11 terrorist attacks Bushs move at the time was seen as somewhat bold in todays Republican Party -- and without thehuge popularityBush enjoyed in the days after 9/11 -- its not a stretch to argue that it never would have happenedPresident Trump took to the floor of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday and in his maiden speech there called the leader of North Korea Rocket Man decried loser terrorists and said certain parts of the world are in fact going to hellBut Trumps perhaps oddly chosen colloquialismsmasked what was a pretty astounding escalation of his rhetoric when it comes to North Korea Just to be clear The president of the United States threatened to wipe a country of 25 million people off the mapNow North Koreas reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life Trump said He later added The United States has great strength and patience but if it isforced to defend itself or its allies we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himselfTrumps rhetoric on North Korea has been very tough before He turned heads last month by if North Korea and its leader Kim Jong Un threatened the United States But Trumps speech Tuesday ratcheted things up in two respects saying the United States would also unleash a massive response  and threatening to totally destroy the countryFire and fury could be interpreted as a threat to simply remove Kim and his government totally destroy North Korea seems to be a signal to the North Korean people that they too could face annihilation alongside their government leaders It sounds a lot like Trump is threatening a completely unprecedented effort to wipe out an entire nation whether through nuclear weapons or more conventional means Its a remarkably big statement and the White House will undoubtedly be asked to clarifyIts also different from the fire and fury comment in that this was Trump delivering a prepared speech in which his words were undoubtedly pored over extensively beforehand The White House acknowledged after Trump made the fire and fury comments  and analysts generally agreed that perhaps the commander in chief got a little carried away and became hyperbolic  as he tendsto doAfter the speech the White House seemed to try to downplay the novelty of Trumps threat comparing it to what then-President Obama said last year  Obama saidPresidents have always been clear to deter threats We could obviously destroy North Korea with our arsenals - last year Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) But in context Obama was actually making the case  that adding But aside from the humanitarian costs of that they are right next door to our vital ally Republic of Korea Obama also wasnt making a threat so much as registering a statement of fact Trump was saying the United States might have no choice but to do what Obama was merely saying the US was capable ofTrumps address to the United Nations on Tuesday should erase any doubts that he is threatening a completely unprecedented military strike against North Korea This seems to be Trump even more fully embracing in which he makes himself so unpredictable that other world leaders fear setting him offBut that approach isnt without its downsides Retired Gen David Petraeus There is some merit to this You can argue perhaps there is some merit to it in international relations although it obviously can go too far My concern there with the so-called madman theory  that actually [Richard] Nixon put forward through Kissinger where he had Kissinger tell the Soviets You know Nixons under a lot of pressure right now and you know he drinks at night sometimes so you guys ought to be real careful Dont push this into a crisis There may again be some merit into the madman theory until you get in a crisis But you do not want the other side thinking you are irrational in a crisis You do not want the other side thinking that you might be sufficiently irrational to conduct a first strike or to do something you know so-called unthinkablePolls show the American people are not confident in Trumps ability to handle the North Korea situation with  Trumps words Tuesday likely wont calm many fears but hes clearly gambling on North Korea backing down in the face of big talkA man who has been   and panting like a dog after a married woman  should not be seen  a woman in front of millions of television viewers Not if he wants to improve his image anywayBut Donald Trump looming behind Hillary Clinton like a mob boss only reinforced his perception as a schoolyard bully in the The town hall format at Washington University in St Louis allowed the candidates to move around as they responded to audience questions and it offered a view of the candidates body language As a dance critic this is what I find especially interesting With the explosive revelations in the 2005 tapes released this weekend by The Washington Post all eyes were going to be on Trump Would he be able to atone for his sexist and demeaning remarks by respecting Clintons personal space and being civil Even contriteThe dance was grim from the start Trump entered looking exhausted In a break with protocol the candidates didnt shake hands And then Trump began lurking behind Clinton when she spoke with his carefully planted stance his narrowed eyes and his frown  His overbearing presence told us all we needed to know about whether last nights Trump had matured beyond the one in the tapes In one of them he crowed about the superpowers of his stardom which enabled him to grab women by the py You can do anythingHas he changed in the last 11 years Not a whit apparently Trump sounded like a bully on the tapes and he acted like a bully in the debateThe body doesnt lie  This is exactly who Donald Trump is Clinton said speaking about the tapes Trump helpfully backed her up with his demeanor He paced and rocked and grimaced as she spoke he broke into her time by shouting over her When she protested that she had not done the same to him he shot back with all the finesse youd hear in a middle school gym Thats cause you got nothin to sayWhen it was his turn to speak Trump got angry pointed at her swung his arms around with alarming force Clinton had to have been disturbed by the ill temper and aggressive gestures he directed at her though she seemed remarkably unflappableBut bullying was on her mind Late in the evening she mentioned the Trump effect and noted that bullies in school are on the rise because of it She was referring to a 2016 survey of K-12 teachers titled  that was conducted by Teaching Tolerance a project of the  It found a recent increase in bullying harassment and intimidation among students along with a rise in fear and anxiety particularly among the minority groups Trump has targeted  This anxiety came to the fore in a question raised by a young Muslim woman in the audience who asked the candidates what they plan to do about Islamophobia And here Clinton missed an opportunity She could have swooped in with a warm sympathetic connection  something that was sorely missing in the debate which had spiraled into abitter feud She could have stepped even nearer to the woman looked her in the eye She could have bonded just for a momentTrump who had called for a ban on Muslims entering the country gave the expected muddled answer essentially blaming Muslims for the problemYou could see the young womanlooking to Clinton with wounded hope in her eyes Did Clinton relate personally at all to this womans anxiety She gave a crisp thorough answer praising Captain Humayun Khan the Muslim soldier killed in action in the Iraq War whose parents tangled with Trump She mentioned Muhammad AliMy vision of America is an America where everyone has a place if you are willing to work hard and do your part and you contribute to the community she said firmly But to a woman waiting to hear that she was understood accepted and safe Clinton betrayed little feeling offered up none of the vulnerability that the audience member had shown in speaking upAfter the debate guess who was having the earnest one-on-one talk with that concerned woman looking her in the eye Bill ClintonThis debate characterized by plenty of verbal fireworks in the form of insults and backbiting was a rigid and dispiriting display all around Trump was the lurking hulk without a shred of self-awareness eager to dominate but unable to answer a question Clinton was unshakable determined  and well-armored In a forum made for movement Trump blundered in getting too close Clinton erred in keeping her distanceof 2015 is overTuesdays Las Vegas debate featured a series of high-profile skirmishes Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio battled over the National Security Agency and its metadata program as well as their stances on immigration Jeb Bush went after Donald Trump hard casting him as an unserious person The Donald dismissed Bush as irrelevant because of his low poll numbersBelow is my take on the best and the worst from the night that was*  Finally John Ellis Bush showed some spirit and fight Jeb repeatedly took it to Trump and refused to back down amid a cascade of insults the real estate magnate launched at him Its somewhat remarkable given Trumps clear status as the Republican front-runner  and make no mistake he is  that Jeb was the only candidate willing to go at the billionaire Jeb deserves significant credit for largely fighting that fight aloneThe issue for Jeb is that his performance may be (and probably is) too little too late He has dipped so far down in national  and most state  polls that its not immediately clear that a single strong debate performance can revivify his candidacyBut Ive criticized Bush for months for not stepping up in big moments He did it tonight*  The Florida senator proved (again) that he is the best natural debater in the field Totally in control Relaxed Extremely knowledgeable He won rhetorically speaking a face-off with Cruz over metadata and held his own when Cruz attacked him on his participation in the Senate push for comprehensive immigration reform When Trump  more on this later  had no clue what the nuclear triad was Rubio stepped in to flex his policy chopsThe debate focused a bit too much on his Senate record on immigration for Rubio to be a slam-dunk winner But he reaffirmed that he is a top-tier candidate  and deserves to be*  The New Jersey governor had one goal in this debate distinguish himself from the likes of Cruz and Rubio as someone who has never spent any time in Washington He did so  repeatedly and successfully He effectively injected himself into an extended back and forth between Cruz and Rubio on the NSA to say essentially regular people dont have any idea what the hell you guys are talking about and they dont care Christie went into this debate with momentum in New Hampshire nothing he said or did Tuesday night will hurt that roll*  Halfway-ish through the debate I thought Trump was clearly in the winners circle He was measured in his responses unruffled under attack and avoided the epic cliches  we dont win anymore you will be so happy etc  that he typically falls back on That hour was the best hour of any debate thus far for Trump Unfortunately for him it wasnt a one-hour debate*  Okay I probably spent too much time trying to figure out who kept coughing But I loved Encyclopedia Brown as a kid  so sue me And yes  (And double yes figured it out before me) It appears Dr Ben Carson is battling a cold I can hear him coughing and sniffling   Paul Joncich (@pjoncich) *  The former American Idol contestant and daughter of former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown (R) sang the national anthem before Tuesdays debate And she was damn good*  Theres no debate that Carson is a brilliant doctor There should also be no debate that he is just not a very good political candidate Carsons refusal to offer an opinion on where he came down on the debate over security versus freedom  as articulated by Cruz and Rubio  was a giant head-scratcher Time and again when asked about foreign policy and national security Carson would say lots of words but very few of them made sense together Aside from his opening statement which I thought was quite good he looked entirely out of his depth*  The Ohio governor needed a moment and just couldnt find one Thankfully he abandoned the mad as hell and not going to take it anymore persona he had adopted for the last debate and got back to who he really is a committed pragmatist with an impressive record of results in Ohio But Kasichs ear for what this electorate wants is way off at one point he used his 18 years of service on the House Armed Services Committee as a proof point that he knew what he was talking about regarding national security matters No Republican voter wants to back someone who touts his two decades spent inside the Washington machine*  Cruz wasnt actively bad in this debate His skills as a presenter and performer ensure he will never be genuinely bad But he seemed to bite off more than he could chew on several occasions His face-off with Rubio early in the debate over the NSA didnt end well for him and his extended attempt to interrupt moderator Wolf Blitzer didnt either Cruz got almost 16 minutes of speaking time  the most of any of the nine candidates  but didnt do as much as I expected he would with it Not a terrible performance by any means But short of expectations*  He just couldnt keep it up for the whole debate Trump showed his thin skin when under attack from Jeb he dismissed the Florida governor with this polling slam Im at 42 and youre at 3 Later in the debate Trump clearly had no idea what the nuclear triad was and in a transparent attempt to cover his tracks resorted to his we need to be so strong crutch*  The South Carolina senator continues to dominate the undercard debates  and as our Philip Bump argued  Why is he a loser then Because its almost impossible to imagine him gaining enough in the polls to make the big stage before the next debate*  Eight dudes on the stage All dressed almost exactly the same Can  try something other than a blue suit white shirt and red tieRepublicans unveiled their  Thursday morning and there were some major winners and losersThe top GOP tax writerHouse Ways and Means Committee ChairmanKevin Brady (R-Tex) foreshadowed just how hard it would be to craft the biggest rewrite of the tax code since 1986 when he said in August Tax reform is hard Its the challenge of a generationHeres a rundown of who is happy and who isnt as the detailsemerge regardingthe  the centerpiece of President Trumps MAGAnomics agendaAmerican mega-businesseswould get a substantial tax reduction The bill cuts the top rate that large corporations pay from 35 percent to 20 percent the biggest one-time drop in the big-business tax rate ever On top of that companies would get some new tax breaks to help lower their bills such as the abilityto deduct all the costs of purchasing new equipment as well as a special low rate on any money they bring backto the United States from low-tax countriessuch as Ireland Many businesses have been holding cash overseas to avoid 35 percent US taxes Now they would get to bring the money home at a tax rate of 12percentThe entire business tax systemwould also change from a worldwide system in which money anywhere around the globe is taxed to a territorial systemin whichits mostly money made in the United States that is taxed Businesses have long lobbied for this changeThe estate taxoften called the death tax by its criticswould go away by 2024 meaning wealthy families would be able to pass on lavish estates and trust funds to their heirs tax-free At the moment only estates worth over $549 million face the estate tax (the GOP plan doubles that amount immediately until the tax goes totally away) The mega-wealthy also would get to keep charitable deductions a popular way to lower their tax bills and they no longer would have to pay the alternative minimum tax (AMT) a safeguard against excessive tax dodging thats been in place since 1969The bill eliminates the alternative minimum tax which forces people who earn more than about $130000 to calculate their taxes twice once with all the deductions they can find and once with the AMT method which prevents most tax breaks There is perhaps no better example of how much this will benefit the rich than that fact that Donald Trump would have paid in taxes in 2005 (the one year for which we have his tax returns) without the AMTSome wealthy Americans who run businesses structured as sole proprietorships partnerships or LLCs would get a sizable discount on their taxes Under the GOP bill these pass through companies would pay a tax rate of only 25 percent on 30 percent of their business income a big reduction from the 396 percent rate some pay now The bill tries to prevent service firms like law firms and accounting firms from being able to pay the lower 25 percent rate but a good tax lawyer can probably make the case for these firms to qualify Also on the campaign trail Trump said that hedge funds were getting away with murder on their taxes and that he would take away carried interest the popularopening in the tax code these Wall Street titans use But the bill does not change or eliminate carried interest which is also used by some real estate developersThe legislation would cut in half the mortgage interest deduction used by millions of American homeowners changing the deductions rules for new mortgagesmade on their first $1 million worth of home loans Under the bill for new mortgages they would be able to deduct interest payments made only on their first $500000 worth of home loansHome-builder stocks are plummeting as a result since many builders make a lot of their money from constructing high-end mansions In addition to capping the mortgage deduction the bill also caps the state-and-local-property-tax deduction to $10000 a year another hit to higher-end homeowners That said many economists and even some Democrats say these limits are a good idea because the housing incentives in the current tax code favor the wealthyThe National Low Income Housing Coalition says mortgages over  Only 5 percent of mortgages are more than that amountThe National Federation of Independent Business which represents 325000 small businesses said it would not support the GOP bill because it leaves too many small businesses behind The original idea was to lower small businesses taxes to 25 percent but the language in the bill allows small-business owners to pay only 30 percent of their business income at the 25 percent rate The rest would be paid at the business owners individual tax rate Any individuals earning over $200000 a year (or couples earningmore than $260000) would pay the rest of their taxes at a rate of 35 percentSay goodbye to most of the state-and-local-tax deduction (SALT) Over a third of filers in many Democratic states such as California New York New Jersey and Connecticut claim the SALT deduction on their returns Under the GOP planpeople would still be able to deduct up to $10000 on the property taxes they pay locallybut they would no longer be able to deduct the other taxes they pay to state or local governments from their federal tax paymentsWhile the bill includes lots of tax breaks for big businesses and the rich the bottom 35 percent of Americans do not get any extra benefits according to Lily Batchelder who served on President Barack Obamas National Economic Council They already have a $0 federal tax liability Some argue a more equitable tax system would increase the credits (money back) that lower-income families get especially those that work low-wage jobs The GOP preserves the earned-income tax credit a popular refundable credit for the working class but the bill does not expand itTheNational Council of Nonprofits warns that charitable deductions are likely to go down under this bill While the GOP enables the wealthy to continue deducting their charitable giving many middle- and upper-middle-class families would no longer get that tax break because they probably would stop itemizing their deductions At the moment about  of Americans itemize but under the GOP bill the standard deduction roughly doubles from $6350 to $12000 for individuals and $12700 to $24000 for married couples meaning fewer people would probably itemize The GOP argues that middle-class people should end up giving more to charity since they will pay less in taxesAway from the cameras and apart from the nonstop drama of the White House Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has come to play a role unlike any other Cabinet memberThe retired Marine general has become a force for calm order and in the eyes of the presidents critics quiet resistance to some of President Trumps most combative and divisive instincts In perhaps his greatest political feat Mattis has maintained this air of independence without directly provoking a president who demands absolute loyalty The latest example came Wednesday morning when Trump vented his frustrations with North Korea after its latest missile launch Talking is not the answer Trump tweeted only a few hours before Mattis met at the Pentagon with Song Young-moo South Koreas defense minister and delivered a very different message to reporters Were never out of diplomatic solutions Mattis said On Tuesday night Mattis seemed again to be in mitigation mode when he announced that he would be pulling together a panel of experts to provide advice on how to implement Trumps ordered ban on transgender troops   Trump announced the ban last month in a series of tweets that caught the militarys top brass largely by surprise By contrast Mattiss statement promised an exhaustive study and also seemed to leave the door open to allowing some transgender troops who are serving to stay in uniformPerhaps the most striking example of Mattiss inclination to tamp down deep political divisions came in the wake of the recent violence in Charlottesville Mattis was recorded in a video uploaded to Facebook speaking off the cuff to a small group of American troops in Jordan Our country right now its got problems that we dont have in the military Mattis told them You just hold the line until our country gets back to understanding and respecting each other and showing itThe comments were interpreted by some as a critique of Trumps leadershipMattis and his top advisers blanch at suggestions that he is resisting the wishes of his commander in chief As defense secretary Mattis has steered away from the public spotlight avoiding Pentagon news conferences and on-camera interviews And he has expressed frustration with those who scrutinize his remarks for signs of disagreement with TrumpIn his often terse public statements the defense secretary has repeatedly noted that he is not the ultimate decision-maker on matters of military or foreign policyThe American people elected the commander in chief Mattis said after Trumps tweets last month on the new transgender policy They didnt elect me  He has that authority and responsibility So that was fully within his responsibility Mattis is far from the only senior Trump administration official who has seemed to be at odds with the president of late Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn both distanced themselves from Trumps remarks following the Charlottesville violence for their failure to unequivocally condemn hate groupsThe president speaks for himself Tillerson said coolly of Trumps public statements Tillerson and Cohns comments both fueled new tensions with the White House and fed speculation that they could soon be gone from the administrationBut Mattiss deft political touch has surprised many who watched him fall out of favor with the Obama White House As a four-star general Mattis pushed for the Obama administration to take a harder line against Irans destabilizing behavior in places such as Yemen Iraq and Syria Ultimately his aggressive style alienated the White House and the president he was serving  In the Trump administration he has managed to press his differences without provoking a backlashIn many instances his opposing view seems shaped by his more than four decades of military service in the Marine Corps than any overt political disagreement with the president Some analysts speculated for example that Mattiss slow-rolling resistance to Trumps order on transgender troops may be motivated by a deeply held military bias for consistency and continuity over sudden shifts in policyHes clearly saying hes not going to be a political agent of change inside the military said retired Lt Gen David Barno who led US troops in Afghanistan and is now a professor at American University Others interpreted Mattiss response as an expression of respect for the oath that transgender troops took to serve During his confirmation hearings in January Mattis offered unflinching support for the service of gay and transgender troops Frankly Ive never cared much about two consenting adults and who they go to bed with he said in response to a question from Sen Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY)Even his unscripted remarks to troops in Jordan which were interpreted by many as a direct rebuke of Trumps response to the violence in Charlottesville echoed an alarm Mattis has previously soundedThis spring Mattis was asked in a rare interview with New Yorker magazine about his biggest worries in his new job The lack of political unity in America Mattis replied The lack of fundamental friendlinessHe sounded a similar theme in a commencement speech at the US Military Academy at West Point NY For those privileged to wear the cloth of our nation to serve in the United States Army you stand the ramparts unapologetic apolitical defending our experiment in self-governance  and you hold the line he told the graduatesMattiss public worries about the state of political debate in the United States and the climate of divisiveness reflect a long-standing concern of the military Political infighting has stymied efforts to produce a long-term budget plan for the Pentagon that Democrats and Republicans have described as essentialIts incredibly frustrating to the military that we cant put aside our political differences for the greater good of the country said Kathleen H Hicks a top Pentagon official in the Obama administration They dont understand itIn Mattiss recent call for the military to hold the line until the country comes to its senses Hicks heard a common refrain Its what they all say to each other to pep themselves up she said of the military brassOther analysts heard in the statement something darker  a fundamental disconnect between the tight-lipped Pentagon chief and his presidentI think Mattis is a profoundly decent guy working for a profoundly indecent guy said Eliot Cohen a top official in the George W Bush administration That sets up a conflict  The psychic tension has to be acuteThe United States and North Korea are engaging in high-tension brinkmanship with North Korea warning Tuesday that it will hit the US first with nuclear weapons but the prospects that this could escalate into an actual clash of arms are slimThe stakes remain too high for both countries analysts say today as they were yesterday as they were last year But the temperature in the region has become decidedly hotter in recent daysAnd theres always the chance that one side or the other could miscalculateExpectations are mounting that North Korea will unleash some kind of provocation this week and the US Navy rerouted an aircraft carrier strike group capable of both firing missiles and shooting missiles down to the Korean Peninsula over the weekendOn Tuesday President Trump issued his latest tweet taking aim at Pyongyang North Korea is looking for trouble If China decides to help that would be great If not we will solve the problem without them USA Pyongyang said Tuesday that pre-emptive strikes are not the exclusive right of the United StatesOur military is keeping an eye on the movement of enemy forces while putting them in our nuclear sights declared the Rodong Sinmun the mouthpiece of the ruling Workers Party With trademark bravado the newspaper warned that North Korea will use its mighty nuclear weapons to obliterate the United States if it made the slightest movement toward a preemptive strikeBut there are good reasons to think the tension wont escalate further into an actual clashI dont think were about to go to war against North Korea said Ralph Cossa president of the Center for Strategic and International Studiess Pacific Forum in Honolulu But the United States is certainly trying to send a message that they are fed up with the North Koreans and with sending strong letters of protestSaturday is the Day of the Sun in North Korea the 105th anniversary of the birthday of Kim Il Sung the states founding president and the current leaders grandfather It coincides with Easter weekend in the United States and theres a definite North Korean pattern of disrupting American holidaysAnalysts say they think North Korea may conduct  or   or something else  to mark the day  The American aircraft carrier at the head of the strike group the USS Carl Vinson was the very same one that a North Korea-linked website showed going up flames in  last month when it was participating in drills with the South Korean military  The mere suggestion of striking North Korea has been ruled out by successive American administrationsFor one its not clear where to strike North Koreas nuclear test site is underground and its fissile material is spread among multiple sites while its missiles are increasingly fired from mobile launches that can be wheeled out from any hangar or tunnelSecond any attack on North Korea could be expected to unleash a devastating attack on Seoul a metropolitan area of some 20 million people that lies within reach of North Koreas conventional artilleryI dont think there is a good option for the US to preemptively strike North Korea said Euan Graham a former British diplomat who served in Pyongyang and is now at the Lowy Institute in Sydney But I think coercive diplomacy like this can prevent a real escalationSending an aircraft carrier and its accompanying guided-missile destroyers and cruiser to the region was a classic coercive diplomatic measure Graham said Its straight out of the geopolitical playbookCossa agreed The first thing on the checklist is demonstrate resolve Cossa said Try to make the North Koreans and perhaps the Chinese too a bit nervousVan Jackson an associate professor at the Daniel K Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies said that he was 99percent certain that the aircraft carrier was not moving to strike North KoreaThe Carl Vinson is a big strategic asset Look at what we did in Syria  it was quick and quiet and with no posturing We just did it Jackson said Were doing the exact opposite with North Korea This is big and loud and slow  Trumps national security adviser HR McMaster said Sunday that it was prudent to have the aircraft carrier back in the region given North Koreas pattern of provocative behaviorBut analysts like Jackson say they are still worried about the chance that Trump might feel emboldened after his  and miscalculate if North Korea does do something provocative that is not a nuclear test or long-range missile launch  perhaps along the lines of a more conventional attack such as the sinking of a South Korean naval corvette in 2010that killed 46 sailorsMaybe Trump has some deep dark red line that he hasnt shown us he said Jackson noted the difference between a preemptive strike  acting to stop an imminent threat like the launch of an intercontinental missile that could hit the United States  and a preventive strike against a threat that was not imminent an option that has been historically unthinkableBut its becoming more and more thinkable with North Korea because people are frustrated with the lack of options Jackson saidAs for North Koreas actions former British diplomat Graham warned against reading too much into Pyongyangs latest histrionicsTheir diplomacy relies on being threat-based he said Thats their only leverageGreg Hardy his NFL career stalled is making a

can assure you of thatHardy was a stellar if volatile defensive end for the Carolina Panthers but his career nosedived after he missed most of the 2014 season because of an alleged assault incident involving an ex-girlfriend and a bed covered with guns Initially suspended 10 games his sentence was reduced as the NFL grappled with how to punish players during its domestic violence crisis of 2014 Hardy was found guilty by a North Carolina judge and following procedure in that state asked for a jury trial The case was dismissed when the alleged victim did not appearGlazer cites Hardys past as a reason to keep him out of MMAI would be incredibly disappointed in any of my fellow MMA coaches and any promoters if they took Greg Hardy in and taught him a shred of our incredible sportMany of us

signing with the Dallas Cowboys in 2015 He never returned to his previous form though and was a near-constant distraction When he was activated after his four-game suspension he immediately grabbed headlines with an odd interview in which he speculated about the attractiveness of the wives of quarterbacks such as Tom Brady and Blake Bortles He continued to talk about guns an uncomfortable topic

misdemeanor simple assault in DC Superior CourtShe was released on her own recognizance and is scheduled to appear again in court in late September Until then a judge ordered her to stay away from the X2 bus line and from the bus driver she is accused of assaultingThe judge also ordered Brown to undergo weekly drug tests and be assessed for possible mental health servicesBrown who appeared in court wearing a pink-and-black skirt and gray zip-up sweater was quiet as she appeared before the judge She declined to speak with reportersBut a description of Browns alleged assault and subsequent arrest provided by Metro Transit Police appeared to shed light on what may have prompted her actions while riding the X2 bus Saturday afternoon near the intersection of Minnesota Avenue and Benning RoadAccording to the police report Brown told police she was standing by the door of the bus waiting to get off The driver a newly hired Metro employee told Brown to have a nice day Brown shot back Are you talking to me Brown said she then threw the purple coffee tumbler at the driver She said she had used the tumbler to relieve herself at the back of the bus according to the report[The defendant] stated the cup was filled to the top with urine and she tossed the urine on the [bus driver] because she was mad at [the driver] and hates Metro the police report said  The incident was captured on the buss surveillance video The bus driver went to a hospital to be cleaned up and decontaminated and transit police searched for the assailant without success in the area where the bus had stoppedAccording to the report Browns actions began to hang heavy on her conscience after she saw news reports that police were looking for the assailantAt 3 am Wednesday the report says she flagged down a police officer  the hotline number provided in the news reports was apparently not being answered in the middle of the night she said  and confessed to the crime the police report saidShe told police that she spoke with her pastor about the incident and he encouraged her to turn herself in She also told police that she had an apology letter that she wanted to have read to the mediaMetro spokesman Dan Stessel said the agency has the letter but cannot release it because it is considered evidence Members of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 689 Metros largest union filled the courtroom Thursday and waited hours for Browns appearance  Union Vice President Carroll Thomas said he spoke to the victim Thursday morning She has not returned to work he said and she is fearful that she might have contracted a disease or infection from the attack particularly because the contents of the cup splashed onto her face and into her mouthShes so torn up its ridiculous he said Shes so scared that she might be infected with somethingThe driver who could not be reached for comment Thursday is a relatively new bus operator having just completed her initial 90-day probationary period But Thomas said similar incidents happen frequently to operatorsJuice a fire extinguisher  things get poured on us or thrown at us all the time said Thomas who has been driving buses for Metro for 18 years Operators have even reported being spat upon Assaults on drivers have long been a concern there were 75 last year The X2 route has among the highest number of reported incidents of crime among Metros nearly 300 routesThomas and other union officials say Metro Transit Police have not done enough to protect drivers and prevent assaults They have no real plan on how to combat this and theyve done nothing to protect the operators Thomas saidUnion officials say Metro has not sought input from the union on potential solutions or strategies and that transit officials dont take the problem seriously Thomas gestured at the courtroom and the union members filling the seats many wearing matching red union T-shirts Not a soul from management is here he said Theyre two blocks away and no one comes down here for thisStessel the Metro spokesman defended the agency and disputed the allegation that management is indifferent to violence against driversWe absolutely agree with the union that bus operator assaults are a serious concern No one should be assaulted for doing their job he saidStessel said three dozen police officers are assigned to a special Metrobus Enforcement Division They ride buses and check in with operators about problems theyre noticing along their routes  often while wearing plainclothes to avoid tipping off would-be offendersOf course that doesnt cover every bus every day  but it is a sizable devotion of resources exclusively to bus Stessel saidThe agency also installed clear plastic guards that are meant to separate the drivers seat from the rest of the bus But the union says they do not provide sufficient protection  The shields are intended to protect operators from being punched or otherwise seriously injured by a passenger but the one on the X2 bus Saturday did not prevent the attack There also is a gap in the shield to allow drivers a direct line of sight to the rearview mirrorsStessel said the shields are installed on a third of buses now and officials are working to retrofit older buses with the devices  the design of which was tested and vetted by union representativesWe are open to any and all recommendations that bus operators have to help solve this problem he saidMetro management and the union agree on one thing They both would like to see legislation that would increase the penalty for attacking a transit operator automatically making it a felony rather than a misdemeanor Faiz Siddiqui contributed to this reportA week ago Donald Trump told thethe North American Treaty Organization (NATO) was obsolete At the same time he claimed NATO is When the new president meets with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday May will no doubt push for some clarity on these comments which have left Americans and Europeans alike

a slow startMattis and the transition team are reportedly at odds over  leaving it unclear who will be tapped for the ASD job Will the new ASD be an old hand in transatlantic affairs or a NATO-skeptic The answer should give us a clearer view of the kind of policies the new administration will pursue NATO heads of state will convene in the summer for a major summit meeting in Belgium as announced by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the last major gathering of NATO leaders in NATO leaders have gathered for just  since the organizations founding in 1949 During the Cold War such high-level meetings were rare  Since the end of the Cold War however the gatherings have become more regular From 1990 to 2015 there were 18 summits 10 of these came after Sept 11 2001 as the Alliance turned its focus to countering terrorism in  and elsewhereThese summits are important  in NATOs evolution Summit agendas tend to focus on items of major political and strategic significance such as the accession

intended to enhance the Alliances deterrence and defense posture in Central and Eastern Europe directed against possible Russian aggressionThis summers NATO Summit will mark not only the first of the Trump era it will also be the first summit to take place at  As with the last two summits Russia is likely to occupy a major part of the agenda Will President Trump attend And if he does what kind of reception will he receive In response to Russias annexation of Crimea the Obama administration unveiled several programs to reassure our European allies and partners In June 2014 the White House asked

other NATO members follow suitFor now one thing is certain Europe will be watching Washington closely on each of these fronts in the coming monthsChinese President Xi Jinping opened the countrys 19thParty Congress last week with a three-hour before 2000 party leaders Held once every five years the  is Chinas most authoritative institution and the presidents Political Report is always a significant eventThe report discusses the work of the past five years determines priorities for the next five years and sets the Party line on major policy issues  including foreign policy Xis Political Report at this Congress was uniquely important because it  to the core tenets of Xi Jinping Thought a doctrine that the party enshrined in its constitution thereby elevating Xi to the status of paramount leaders Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping  The Political Report  dramatic breaks in the countrys foreign relations It can however help clarify signals and noise from past foreign policy behavior by giving clues about which underlying trends in Chinese foreign policy matter most and will endure into the futureCompared to the his predecessor Hu Jintao delivered in 2012 Xis speech offered a subtle but significant shift particularly in these three areasChinese leaders have long bemoaned their countrys  which spans from Chinas 1839 defeat in the Opium Wars to the birth of the Peoples Republic of China in 1949 Xi promised to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and restore China to its rightful great power status by 2049  the centennial of the PRCs foundingXis Political Report included the phrase great rejuvenation 27 times  compared with just seven mentions in Hus 2012 speech Xi also used more specific language offering a multistage plan to achieve rejuvenation across three time periods 2020 2035 and 2050 For example within the military realm he proposed that Chinas army would complete mechanization by 2020 modernization by 2035 and would evolve into a world-class army by 2050Xis rhetoric implies that China will not maintain the low global profile that its last great leader Deng Xiaoping had urged Indeed Xis speech announced Chinas renewed focus on global combat capabilities and declared a new era that will see China move closer to the center of the world stageAccordingly Xis speech was marked by triumphalism and a focus on China as a strong country or great power These phrases appeared 30 times in Xis speech far more frequently than in Hus speech (roughly 20)Chinas renewed confidence flows partly from its perception of American power Chinese writers focus inordinately on multipolarity  a phrase that generally refers to a world of multiple great powers but for Chinese writers is a  Although Hus report saw multipolarity deepening Xis report more optimistically announced that it was rapidly accelerating an assessment likely to encourage China to confidently pursue its interests  In recent years Beijing has demonstrated growing interest in global governance  the use of global institutions to solve transnational problems This interest has bumped up in the wake of the election of Donald Trump as reflected in Xis this year when he criticized protectionismXis Political Report suggests global governance will be a Chinese priority at the highest levels of central power He vowed that China would always be a defender of international order that it supports the multilateral trading system and that it will promote economic globalization  language that was unnecessary in Hus speechClimate change is clearly an emerging policy priority While Hu had suggested in 2012 that China would actively respond to climate change Xi boldly declared that China was in the driving seat for efforts to combat the effects of climate changeBehind Chinas turn to global governance lies emerging concern over Americas turn away from it which Xi noted has produced instability and uncertainty US threats to  and withdraw from the  have thrown the global order into a period of big developments big changes and big challengesIn an implicit swipe at Washington Xi used strong language declaring that no country can respond to the challenges of mankind alone and that no country can return to a self-enclosed islandBreaking from past policy Xi argued that Chinas system offers a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence Xis language suggests China might actively promote its political model worldwide which would be an intriguing (though still unlikely) developmentIn language far stronger than Hus Xi boldly declared that China is resolved to never give up its own legitimate rights and interests and would never swallow the bitter fruit of damage to its own interestsXi dutifully included the usual bromides promising that China would never pursue expansionism or hegemony Even so his speech will likely rattle neighboring countries whose interests sometimes clash with BeijingsFor example Xi doubled down on Chinas provocative behavior in the South China Sea Echoing  that preceded the conference Xi counted South China Sea reef and island construction among his top accomplishments and boasted of his successful prosecution of maritime rights In contrast Hus speech did not explicitly mention the South China Sea  Xis signature foreign initiative is the  program that unites Eurasia through Chinese infrastructure projects and land/sea trade routes He listed the program among his achievements and committed to promoting its expansion Interestingly Chinas  was mentioned in Hus report but not in Xis perhaps downgraded after Indias admittanceMuch of Xis Political Report talked about familiar goals and priorities The departures from Hus report coupled with the as Chinas unquestioned policymaker for the foreseeable future suggests we may see a China more focused on great power status more active in global governance more triumphant about its political model and more assertive throughout AsiaDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton dont agree on much but they seem to be in sync on trade Each wants to address Chinas alleged currency manipulation both want more litigation at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and Trump has borrowed a page from Clintons 2008 playbook in promising to move unilaterally against foreign trade partners that Washington deems to be violating US exporter rightsBut most of all Trump and Clinton both vehemently oppose the  a trade agreement involving 12 Pacific Rim nations that together account for 40 percent of global GDP Why  There is a saying in Washington that it takes a Republican to launch a trade deal and a Democrat to conclude one Presidential candidates have historically tended to favor protectionist policies only to reverse themselves once elected In 2008 for example Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama fought over who would move faster to renegotiate NAFTA the North American Free Trade Agreement But Obama later signed the TPP a deal that makes NAFTAs legal obligations look archaic by comparisonIn 2016 however something more fundamental than mere populism is happening Critics insist that TPP and deals like it are suspicious because they are too long and complicated Trump  that [i]ts 5600 pages long so complex that nobodys read it Clinton suggests that she has read it and yet without referring to any particular provision  [o]nce I saw what the outcome was I opposed it Could something so long and complicated be any good  In 1947 the General Agreements and Tariffs and Trade (GATT) began tackling tariffs as the main protectionist instrument of governments The GATT preamble makes clear that the goal was to reduce discrimination in trade not necessarily create what we like to call free trade After all governments were allowed to keep their tariffs often at levels never historically charged The deal instead was that most of these tariffs would have to be capped and lowered through subsequent GATT rounds of negotiationsGATT 1947 is a very parsimonious document in this regard Its logic plays out in a mere four articles convert all non-tariff barriers into tariffs (GATT XI) bind them (GATT II) and offer national treatment (GATT III) on all fiscal and nonfiscal measures beyond the tariffs applied on a most-favored nation basis (GATT I) This convert-cap-cut approach has worked wonders Tariffs are at historical lows and almost all tariffs have upper bounds that cannot be legally brokenThen in 1995 the World Trade Organization (WTO) the successor to the GATT went on to tackle services and intellectual property as well as more specialized non-tariff barriers notably health and food-safety standards and technical regulations These standards and regulations are especially tricky since rather than acting as a tax on trade they can trigger a complete import ban In trade this is where the action isCountries routinely set different regulations on things ranging from labeling food ingredients to the color of a farm tractors backup lights These types of technical regulations cover nearly all of global trade including Herein lies the beauty of technical regulations It is easy to find a compound or material that is perfectly correlated with country of origin for historical or geographical reasons and ban it Firms know this and lobby their governments to legislate accordingly Governments in turn explain these measures as centering on consumer safety not commerce opening up countless opportunities to impose what the WTO calls disguised restrictions on tradeIts not just the  of these technical regulations The testing that goes into proving conformity with them is yet another trove of protectionist policies For example the US and Brazil agree on many global standards on telecommunications equipment but Brazil does not accept foreign test data so equipment exported to Brazil is subjected to redundant testing In this sense conformity assessment acts as a bottleneck and can be prohibitively costly for the US exporter The effect is to deter tradeThe complexity of TPP traces to a desire to deal more fully with such measures Building on Korea-US (KORUS) TPP builds in WTO plus provisions on standards and technical regulations Across the board there is a deeper emphasis on basing these measures on agreed-upon science making the process of formulating regulations more transparent and giving foreign exporters opportunities to offer substantive input in the formulation of these measuresNot all of the provisions of these chapters are new In the case of technical regulations for example TPP incorporates key articles from the WTO For those disputes centering on purely incorporated text moreover TPP requires that they be filed at the WTO  to avoid creating a parallel (and potentially contradictory) body of case law on these issuesThe novelty of TPP though is that it goes much further than the WTO in calling on members to afford each other national treatment on both the substance and procedural aspects of technical regulations eliminating the need to retest and recertify exports for example These WTO plus provisions will surely be tested in litigation under TPPSome critics insist all of this goes too far They argue TPP is an unprecedented reach into members regulatory politics This is Sen  when he noted that TPP is much more than a free trade agreement  But trade discrimination in 2016 is different than it was in 1948 when the GATT made its debut or even 1994 when NAFTA came into effect The process of legislating national standards and regulations that can differ from global ones means that governments can block trade in ways the drafters of GATT could never have even imaginedThose who believe in a rules-based global economy should cheer rather than condemn the fact that TPP runs thousands of pages Its complexity reflects the fact that like KORUS before it the deal is going after high-hanging fruit After all the WTO has already picked the low-hanging fruit by disciplining most tariffsIn fact the real benefit of TPP will be that the new provisions on standards and technical regulations set the stage for even deeper provisions in the  between the US and the European Union Unlike the situation with TPP there simply arent 18000 tariffs to cut  so the TTIP aims to boost compatibility and transparency in US-EU bilateral tradeBoth candidates are really talking about the 21 century TPP agreement in 19 century language Its complexity is a sign of the times and an indication that future agreements will require even more page length starting with TTIPA former Illinois police officer accused ofrapinga girl over a decade abruptly ended his trial Tuesday by pleading guilty as the victim was testifying against him in courtKane County officials said the female victim still a minor had already spent a half-hour painfully recounting years of abuse by David L Wright when his attorney interrupted her testimonyThe victim had been on the witness stand for about 30 minutes emotionally describing the crimes committed against her when Wright without warning chose to plead guilty ending the trial the Kane County States Attorneys Office said in a statementAccording to the  Kane County Circuit Judge DJ Tegeler excoriated Wright as he accepted the plea agreementYou have not done anything but ruin her Tegeler told Wright the newspaper reported For you to make her take the witness stand at all I find reprehensibleThe Washington Post generally does not identify victims of sexual assaultWright 55 agreed to a sentence of 23 years in prison for pleading guilty to two counts of criminal sexual assault each a Class 1 felony the states attorneys office saidWhen he was arrested last April Wright was charged with 33 felonies including 16 counts of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child and six counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse according to court records In total those charges would have carried anywhere from 143 to 648 years in prison officials saidUnder his plea agreement Wright must register for life as a sexual offender The plea includes an order of protection that prohibits Wright from having any contact with the victim for five years after his releaseHe received credit for 478 days he had served in the Kane County Jail since he was arrestedQuite frankly I think 500 years sounds reasonableTegeler told Wright as he accepted the plea the Herald reported  During the trial prosecutors described how Wright repeatedlyassaulted the girl from 2005 to 2015 including how it began when she was in second grade and taken into Wrights bathroom prosecutor Lori Schmidt told The Washington PostHe told her it was going to hurt Schmidt said And she screamedIt is not unheard of but also not common for people to enter a plea in the middle of a trial said Schmidt who is assigned to the Kane County Child Advocacy CenterIn Illinois witnesses are presumed competent meaning even minors have to testify in court  though there are accommodations granted for some children such as letting them sit with an advocate or bring a comfort item with them to the witness stand she said  However if Wright had pleaded guilty before the trial began he would have spared the girl from having to testify Schmidt saidFacing their abusers or reliving their abuse through testimony can be difficult and potentially re-traumatizing for some victimsaccording to many advocacy groupsThe idea of testifying may feel overwhelming or intimidating for some survivors of sexual violence readsa statement on the website for theRape Abuse Incest National Network or RAINN a nonprofit that advocates for survivors of sex crimes Everyone responds differently to sharing their experience publicly and testifying in court is no exceptionAt the time of his arrest Wright was a police officer in Elburn a suburban village about 55 miles west of Chicago  Wright joinedthe Elburn Police Department as a sworn officer on Oct 6 1991 according to the department His record showeda few oral reprimands for policy violations and one suspension for a failure to supervise while he was in a supervisory positionChief Nicholas Sikora told The Post in an emailThe department became aware of the case against Wrighton April 24 2015 and put him on paid administrative leave the next day Sikora saidWright was moved to unpaid administrative leave about a week later before retiring from the department on May 5 2015 SikorasaidThe police chiefdeclined to comment further on Wrights arrest and trialAfter a decade of abuse the victimcame forward last year when she was receiving treatment for depression the  reportedI cannot overstate the tremendous courage shown by this victim since this case was reported Kane County States Attorney Joe McMahon said in a statement Her life has been unimaginably altered and we are proud of her willingness to speak out and confront her abuserYoungsexual abuse victims often avoid or delay telling someone about the abuse because they are afraid of backlash or of being hurt by the abuser according to the  citing various studiesIn addition contrary to a belief encapsulated by phrases like stranger danger found the majority of child sexual abuse victims know their perpetrators However this and many other studies noted that it can be difficult to get accurate statistics because many cases of child sexual abuse go unreportedAs far as waiting [10 years] to disclose this isnt uncommon

directlyYou dont know me but youve been inside me and thats why were here todayOn January 17th 2015 it was a quiet Saturday night at home My dad made some dinner and Isat at the table with my younger sister who was visiting for the weekend I was working full timeand it was approaching my bed time I planned to stay at home by myself watch some TV andread while she went to a party with her friends Then I decided it was my only night with her Ihad nothing better to do so why not theres a dumb party ten minutes from my house I wouldgo dance weird like a fool and embarrass my younger sister On the way there I joked thatundergrad guys would have braces My sister teased me for wearing a beige cardigan to a fratparty like a librarian I called myself big mama because I knew Id be the oldest one there Imade silly faces let my guard down and drank liquor too fast not factoring in that my tolerancehad significantly lowered since collegeThe next thing I remember I was in a gurney in a hallway I had dried blood and bandages on thebacks of my hands and elbow I thought maybe I had fallen and was in an admin office oncampus I was very calm and wondering where my sister was A deputy explained I had beenassaulted I still remained calm assured he was speaking to the wrong person I knew no one atthis party When I was finally allowed to use the restroom I pulled down the hospital pants theyhad given me went to pull down my underwear and felt nothing I still remember the feeling ofmy hands touching my skin and grabbing nothing I looked down and there was nothing Thethin piece of fabric the only thing between my vagina and anything else was missing andeverything inside me was silenced I still dont have words for that feeling In order to keepbreathing I thought maybe the policemen used scissors to cut them off for evidenceThen I felt pine needles scratching the back of my neck and started pulling them out my hair Ithought maybe the pine needles had fallen from a tree onto my head My brain was talking mygut into not collapsing Because my gut was saying help me help meI shuffled from room to room with a blanket wrapped around me pine needles trailing behindme I left a little pile in every room I sat in I was asked to sign papers that said Rape Victimand I thought something has really happened My clothes were confiscated and I stood nakedwhile the nurses held a ruler to various abrasions on my body and photographed them The threeof us worked to comb the pine needles out of my hair six hands to fill one paper bag To calmme down they said its just the flora and fauna flora and fauna I had multiple swabs insertedinto my vagina and anus needles for shots pills had a nikon pointed right into my spread legs Ihad long pointed beaks inside me and had my vagina smeared with cold blue paint to check forabrasionsAfter a few hours of this they let me shower I stood there examining my body beneath thestream of water and decided I dont want my body anymore I was terrified of it I didnt knowwhat had been in it if it had been contaminated who had touched it I wanted to take off mybody like a jacket and leave it at the hospital with everything elseOn that morning all that I was told was that I had been found behind a dumpster potentiallypenetrated by a stranger and that I should get retested for HIV because results dont always showup immediately But for now I should go home and get back to my normal life Imagine steppingback into the world with only that information They gave me huge hugs and then I walked outof the hospital into the parking lot wearing the new sweatshirt and sweatpants they provided meas they had only allowed me to keep my necklace and shoesMy sister picked me up face wet from tears and contorted in anguish Instinctively andimmediately I wanted to take away her pain I smiled at her I told her to look at me Im righthere Im okay everythings okay Im right here My hair is washed and clean they gave me thestrangest shampoo calm down and look at me Look at these funny new sweatpants andsweatshirt I look like a PE teacher lets go home lets eat something She did not know thatbeneath my sweats I had scratches and bandages on my skin my vagina was sore and hadbecome a strange dark color from all the prodding my underwear was missing and I felt tooempty to continue to speak That I was also afraid that I was also devastated That day we drovehome and for hours my sister held meMy boyfriend did not know what happened but called that day and said I was really worriedabout you last night you scared me did you make it home okay I was horrified Thats when Ilearned I had called him that night in my blackout left an incomprehensible voicemail that wehad also spoken on the phone but I was slurring so heavily he was scared for me that herepeatedly told me to go find my sister Again he asked me What happened last night Did youmake it home okay I said yes and hung up to cryI was not ready to tell my boyfriend or parents that actually I may have been raped behind adumpster but I dont know by who or when or how If I told them I would see the fear on theirfaces and mine would multiply by tenfold so instead I pretended the whole thing wasnt realI tried to push it out of my mind but it was so heavy I didnt talk I didnt eat I didnt sleep Ididnt interact with anyone After work I would drive to a secluded place to scream I didnt talkI didnt eat I didnt sleep I didnt interact with anyone and I became isolated from the ones Iloved most For one week after the incident I didnt get any calls or updates about that night orwhat happened to me The only symbol that proved that it hadnt just been a bad dream was thesweatshirt from the hospital in my drawerOne day I was at work scrolling through the news on my phone and came across an article Init I read and learned for the first time about how I was found unconscious with my hairdisheveled long necklace wrapped around my neck bra pulled out of my dress dress pulled offover my shoulders and pulled up above my waist that I was butt naked all the way down to myboots legs spread apart and had been penetrated by a foreign object by someone I did notrecognize This was how I learned what happened to me sitting at my desk reading the news atwork I learned what happened to me the same time everyone else in the world learned whathappened to me Thats when the pine needles in my hair made sense they didnt fall from a treeHe had taken off my underwear his fingers had been inside of me I dont even know thisperson I still dont know this person When I read about me like this I said this cant be meThis cant be me I could not digest or accept any of this information I could not imagine myfamily having to read about this online I kept reading In the next paragraph I read somethingthat I will never forgive I read that according to him I liked it I liked it Again I do not havewords for these feelingsAt the bottom of the article after I learned about the graphic details of my own sexual assaultthe article listed his swimming times  Throw in my mile time if thats what were doing Im good at cooking put that inthere I think the end is where you list your extra-curriculars to cancel out all the sickening thingsthatve happenedThe night the news came out I sat my parents down and told them that I had been assaulted tonot look at the news because its upsetting just know that Im okay Im right here and Im okayBut halfway through telling them my mom had to hold me because I could no longer stand up Iwas not okayThe night after it happened he said he didnt know my name said he wouldnt be able toidentify my face in a lineup didnt mention any dialogue between us no words only dancingand kissing Dancing is a cute term was it snapping fingers and twirling dancing or just bodiesgrinding up against each other in a crowded room I wonder if kissing was just faces sloppilypressed up against each other When the detective asked if he had planned on taking me back tohis dorm he said no When the detective asked how we ended up behind the dumpster he said hedidnt know He admitted to kissing other girls at that party one of whom was my own sisterwho pushed him away He admitted to wanting to hook up with someone I was the woundedantelope of the herd completely alone and vulnerable physically unable to fend for myself andhe chose me Sometimes I think if I hadnt gone then this never wouldve happened But then Irealized it would have happened just to somebody else You were about to enter four years ofaccess to drunk girls and parties and if this is the foot you started off on then it is right you didnot continueThe night after it happened he said he thought I liked it because I rubbed his back A back rubNever mentioned me voicing consent never mentioned us speaking a back rubOne more time in public news I learned that my [buttocks] and vagina were completely exposedoutside my breasts had been groped fingers had been jabbed inside me along with pine needlesand debris my bare skin and head had been rubbing against the ground behind a dumpsterwhile an erect freshman was humping my half naked unconscious body But I dont rememberso how do I prove I didnt like itI thought theres no way this is going to trial there were witnesses there was dirt in my body heran but was caught Hes going to settle formally apologize and we will both move on Instead Iwas told he hired a powerful attorney expert witnesses private investigators who were going totry and find details about my personal life to use against me find loopholes in my story toinvalidate me and my sister in order to show that this sexual assault was in fact amisunderstanding That he was going to go to any length to convince the world he had simplybeen confusedI was not only told that I was assaulted I was told that because I couldnt remember Itechnically could not prove it was unwanted And that distorted me damaged me almost brokeme It is the saddest type of confusion to be told I was assaulted and nearly raped blatantly out inthe open but we dont know if it counts as assault yet I had to fight for an entire year to make itclear that there was something wrong with this situationWhen I was told to be prepared in case we didnt win I said I cant prepare for that He wasguilty the minute I woke up No one can talk me out of the hurt he caused me Worst of all Iwas warned because he now knows you dont remember he is going to get to write the scriptHe can say whatever he wants and no one can contest it I had no power I had no voice I wasdefenseless My memory loss would be used against me My testimony was weak wasincomplete and I was made to believe that perhaps I am not enough to win this Thats sodamaging His attorney constantly reminded the jury the only one we can believe is Brockbecause she doesnt remember That helplessness was traumatizingInstead of taking time to heal I was taking time to recall the night in excruciating detail in orderto prepare for the attorneys questions that would be invasive aggressive and designed to steerme off course to contradict myself my sister phrased in ways to manipulate my answersInstead of his attorney saying Did you notice any abrasions He said You didnt notice anyabrasions right This was a game of strategy as if I could be tricked out of my own worth Thesexual assault had been so clear but instead here I was at the trial answering question likeHow old are you How much do you weigh What did you eat that day Well what did you havefor dinner Who made dinner Did you drink with dinner No not even water When did youdrink How much did you drink What container did you drink out of Who gave you the drinkHow much do you usually drink Who dropped you off at this party At what time But whereexactly What were you wearing Why were you going to this party Whatd you do when yougot there Are you sure you did that But what time did you do that What does this text meanWho were you texting When did you urinate Where did you urinate With whom did youurinate outside Was your phone on silent when your sister called Do you remember silencingit Really because on page 53 Id like to point out that you said it was set to ring Did you drinkin college You said you were a party animal How many times did you black out Did you partyat frats Are you serious with your boyfriend Are you sexually active with him When did youstart dating Would you ever cheat Do you have a history of cheating What do you mean whenyou said you wanted to reward him Do you remember what time you woke up Were youwearing your cardigan What color was your cardigan Do you remember any more from thatnight No Okay well let Brock fill it inI was pummeled with narrowed pointed questions that dissected my personal life love lifepast life family life inane questions accumulating trivial details to try and find an excuse forthis guy who didnt even take the time to ask me for my name who had me naked a handful ofminutes after seeing me After a physical assault I was assaulted with questions designed toattack me to say see her facts dont line up shes out of her mind shes practically an alcoholicshe probably wanted to hook up hes like an athlete right they were both drunk whatever thehospital stuff she remembers is after the fact why take it into account Brock has a lot at stake sohes having a really hard time right nowAnd then it came time for him to testify This is where I became revictimized I want to remindyou the night after it happened he said he never planned to take me back to his dorm He said hedidnt know why we were behind a dumpster He got up to leave because he wasnt feeling wellwhen he was suddenly chased and attacked Then he learned I could not rememberSo one year later as predicted a new dialogue emerged Brock had a strange new story almostsounded like a poorly written young adult novel with kissing and dancing and hand holding andlovingly tumbling onto the ground and most importantly in this new story there was suddenlyconsent One year after the incident he remembered oh yeah by the way she actually said yesto everything soHe said he had asked if I wanted to dance Apparently I said yes Hed asked if I wanted to go tohis dorm I said yes Then he asked if he could finger me and I said yes Most guys dont askCan I finger you Usually theres a natural progression of things unfolding consensually not a Qand A But apparently I granted full permission Hes in the clearEven in this story theres barely any dialogue I only said a total of three words before he had mehalf naked on the ground I have never been penetrated after three words He didnt claim to hearme speak one full sentence that night so in the news when it says we met Im not sure I wouldgo so far as to say that Future reference if you are confused about whether a girl can consentsee if she can speak an entire sentence You couldnt even do that Just one coherent string ofwords If she cant do that then no Dont touch her just no Not maybe just no Where was theconfusion This is common sense human decencyAccording to him the only reason we were on the ground was because I fell down Noteif agirl falls help her get back up If she is too drunk to even walk and falls do not mount her humpher take off her underwear and insert your hand inside her vagina If a girl falls help her up Ifshe is wearing a cardigan over her dress dont take it off so that you can touch her breasts Maybeshe is cold maybe thats why she wore the cardigan If her bare [buttocks] and legs are rubbing thepinecones and needles while the weight of you pushes into her get off herNext in the story two people approached you You ran because you said you felt scared I arguethat you were scared because youd be caught not because you were scared of two terrifyingSwedish grad students The idea that you thought you were being attacked out of the blue wasludicrous That it had nothing to do with you being on top my unconscious body You werecaught red handed with no explanation When they tackled you why didnt say StopEverythings okay go ask her shes right over there shell tell you I mean you had just askedfor my consent right I was awake right When the policeman arrived and interviewed the evilSwede who tackled you he was crying so hard he couldnt speak because of what hed seenAlso if you really did think they were dangerous you just abandoned a half-naked girl to runand save yourself No matter which way you frame it it doesnt make senseYour attorney has repeatedly pointed out well we dont know exactly when she becameunconscious And youre right maybe I was still fluttering my eyes and wasnt completely limpyet fine His guilt did not depend on him knowing the exact second that I became unconsciousthat is never what this was about I was slurring too drunk to consent way before I was on theground I should have never been touched in the first place Brock stated At no time did I seethat she was not responding If at any time I thought she was not responding I would havestopped immediately Heres the thing if your plan was to stop only when I was literallyunresponsive then you still do not understand You didnt even stop when I was unconsciousanyway Someone else stopped you Two guys on bikes noticed I wasnt moving in the dark andhad to tackle you How did you not notice while on top of meYou said you would have stopped and gotten help You say that but I want you to explain howyou wouldve helped me step by step walk me through this I want to know if those evilSwedes had not found me how the night would have played out I am asking you Would youhave pulled my underwear back on over my boots Untangled the necklace wrapped around myneck Closed my legs covered me Tucked my bra back into my dress Would you have helpedme pick the needles from my hair Asked if the abrasions on my neck and bottom hurt Wouldyou then go find a friend and say Will you help me get her somewhere warm and soft I dontsleep when I think about the way it could have gone if the Swedes had never come What wouldhave happened to me Thats what youll never have a good answer for thats what you cantexplain even after a yearTo sit under oath and inform all of us that yes I wanted it yes I permitted it and that you are thetrue victim attacked by guys for reasons unknown to you is sick is demented is selfish is stupidIt shows that you were willing to go to any length to discredit me invalidate me and explainwhy it was okay to hurt me You tried unyieldingly to save yourself your reputation at myexpenseMy family had to see pictures of my head strapped to a gurney full of pine needles of my bodyin the dirt with my eyes closed dress hiked up limbs limp in the dark And then even after thatmy family had to listen to your attorney say the pictures were after the fact we can dismissthem To say yes her nurse confirmed there was redness and abrasions inside her but thats whathappens when you finger someone and hes already admitted to that To listen to him use myown sister against me To listen him attempt to paint of a picture of me the seductive partyanimal as if somehow that would make it so that I had this coming for me To listen to him say Isounded drunk on the phone because Im silly and thats my goofy way of speaking To point outthat in the voicemail I said I would reward my boyfriend and we all know what I was thinking Iassure you my rewards program is non-transferable especially to any nameless man thatapproaches meThe point is this is everything my family and I endured during the trial This is everything I hadto sit through silently taking it while he shaped the evening It is enough to be suffering It isanother thing to have someone ruthlessly working to diminish the gravity and validity of thissuffering But in the end his unsupported statements and his attorneys twisted logic fooled noone The truth won the truth spoke for itselfYou are guilty Twelve jurors convicted you guilty of three felony counts beyond reasonabledoubt thats twelve votes per count thirty-six yeses confirming guilt thats one hundred percentunanimous guilt And I thought finally it is over finally he will own up to what he did trulyapologize we will both move on and get better Then I read your statementIf you are hoping that one of my organs will implode from anger and I will die Im almost thereYou are very close Assault is not an accident This is not a story of another drunk college hookupwith poor decision making Somehow you still dont get it Somehow you still soundconfusedI will now take this opportunity to read portions of the defendants statement and respond tothemAlcohol is not an excuse Is it a factor Yes But alcohol was not the one who stripped mefingered me had my head dragging against the ground with me almost fully naked Having toomuch to drink was an amateur mistake that I admit to but it is not criminal Everyone in thisroom has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much or knows someone close tothem who has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much Regretting drinking isnot the same as regretting sexual assault We were both drunk the difference is I did not take offyour pants and underwear touch you inappropriately and run away Thats the differenceIm not mad because you didnt ask for my number Even if you did know me I would not want [to] be in this situation My own boyfriend knows me but if he asked to finger me behind adumpster I would slap him No girl wants to be in this situation Nobody I dont care if youknow their phone number or notAgain you were not wrong for drinking Everyone around you was not sexually assaulting meYou were wrong for doing what nobody else was doing which was pushing your erect [penis] inyour pants against my naked defenseless body concealed in a dark area where partygoers couldno longer see or protect me and own my sister could not find me Sipping fireball is not yourcrime Peeling off and discarding my underwear like a candy wrapper to insert your finger intomy body is where you went wrong Why am I still explaining thisYour attorney is not your scapegoat he represents you Did your attorney say some incredulouslyinfuriating degrading things Absolutely He said you had an erection because it was cold Ihave no wordsSpeak out against campus drinking culture Thats what were speaking out against You thinkthats what Ive spent the past year fighting for Not awareness about campus sexual assault orrape or learning to recognize consent Campus drinking culture Down with Jack Daniels Downwith Skyy Vodka If you want talk to high school kids about drinking go to an AA meeting Yourealize having a drinking problem is different than drinking and then forcefully trying to havesex with someone Show men how to respect women not how to drink lessDrinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that Goes along with that likea side effect like fries on the side of your order Where does promiscuity even come into play Idont see headlines that read  Theres your first powerpointslideI have done enough explaining You do not get to shrug your shoulders and be confusedanymore You do not get to pretend that there were no red flags You do not get to not know whyyou ran You have been convicted of violating me with malicious intent and all you can admit tois consuming alcohol Do not talk about the sad way your life was upturned because alcoholmade you do bad things Figure out how to take responsibility for your own conductRuin a life one life yours you forgot about mine Let me rephrase for you I want to showpeople that one night of drinking can ruin two lives You and me You are the cause I am theeffect You have dragged me through this hell with you dipped me back into that night again andagain You knocked down both our towers I collapsed at the same time you did Your damagewas concrete stripped of titles degrees enrollment My damage was internal unseen I carry itwith me You took away my worth my privacy my energy my time my safety my intimacy myconfidence my own voice until todaySee one thing we have in common is that we were both unable to get up in the morning I am nostranger to suffering You made me a victim In newspapers my name was unconsciousintoxicated woman ten syllables and nothing more than that For a while I believed that thatwas all I was I had to force myself to relearn my real name my identity To relearn that this isnot all that I am That I am not just a drunk victim at a frat party found behind a dumpster whileyou are the All-American swimmer at a top university innocent until proven guilty with somuch at stake I am a human being who has been irreversibly hurt who waited a year to figureout if I was worth somethingMy independence natural joy gentleness and steady lifestyle I had been enjoying becamedistorted beyond recognition I became closed off angry self-deprecating tired irritable emptyThe isolation at times was unbearable You cannot give me back the life I had before that nighteither While you worry about your shattered reputation I refrigerated spoons every night sowhen I woke up and my eyes were puffy from crying I would hold the spoons to my eyes tolessen the swelling so that I could see I showed up an hour late to work every morning excusedmyself to cry in the stairwells I can tell you all the best places in that building to cry where noone can hear you the pain became so bad that I had to tell my boss I was leaving I needed timebecause continuing day to day was not possible I used my savings to go as far away as I couldpossibly beI cant sleep alone at night without having a light on like a five year old because I havenightmares of being touched where I cannot wake up I did this thing where I waited until the suncame up and I felt safe enough to sleep For three months I went to bed at six oclock in themorningI used to pride myself on my independence now I am afraid to go on walks in the evening toattend social events with drinking among friends where I should be comfortable being I havebecome a little barnacle always needing to be at someones side to have my boyfriend standingnext to me sleeping beside me protecting me It is embarrassing how feeble I feel how timidly Imove through life always guarded ready to defend myself ready to be angryYou have no idea how hard I have worked to rebuild parts of me that are still weak It took meeight months to even talk about what happened I could no longer connect with friends witheveryone around me I would scream at my boyfriend my own family whenever they broughtthis up You never let me forget what happened to me At the of end of the hearing the trial Iwas too tired to speak I would leave drained silent I would go home turn off my phone and fordays I would not speak You bought me a ticket to a planet where I lived by myself Every time anew article [would] come out I lived with the paranoia that my entire hometown would find out andknow me as the girl who got assaulted I didnt want anyones pity and am still learning to acceptvictim as part of my identity You made my own hometown an uncomfortable place to beSomeday you can pay me back for my ambulance ride and therapy But you cannot give me backmy sleepless nights The way I have broken down sobbing uncontrollably if Im watching amovie and a woman is harmed to say it lightly this experience has expanded my empathy forother victims I have lost weight from stress when people would comment I told them Ive beenrunning a lot lately There are times I did not want to be touched I have to relearn that I am notfragile I am capable I am wholesome not just livid and weakI want to say this All the crying the hurting you have imposed on me I can take it But when Isee my younger sister hurting when she is unable to keep up in school when she is deprived ofjoy when she is not sleeping when she is crying so hard on the phone she is barely breathingtelling me over and over she is sorry for leaving me alone that night sorry sorry sorry when shefeels more guilt than you then I do not forgive you That night I had called her to try and findher but you found me first Your attorneys closing statement began My sister said she was fineand who knows her better than her sister You tried to use my own sister against me Your pointsof attack were so weak so low it was almost embarrassing You do not touch herIf you think I was spared came out unscathed that today I ride off into sunset while you sufferthe greatest blow you are mistaken Nobody wins We have all been devastated we have all beentrying to find some meaning in all of this sufferingYou should have never done this to me Secondly you should have never made me fight so longto tell you you should have never done this to me But here we are The damage is done no onecan undo it And now we both have a choice We can let this destroy us I can remain angry andhurt and you can be in denial or we can face it head on I accept the pain you accept thepunishment and we move onYour life is not over you have decades of years ahead to rewrite your story The world is huge itis so much bigger than Palo Alto and Stanford and you will make a space for yourself in itwhere you can be useful and happy Right now your name is tainted so I challenge you to makea new name for yourself to do something so good for the world it blows everyone away Youhave a brain and a voice and a heart Use them wisely You possess immense love from yourfamily That alone can pull you out of anything Mine has held me up through all of this Yourswill hold you and you will go onI believe that one day you will understand all of this better I hope you will become a bettermore honest person who can properly use this story to prevent another story like this from ever happening again I fully support your journey to healing to rebuilding your life because that isthe only way youll begin to help othersNow to address the sentencing When I read the probation officers report I was in disbeliefconsumed by anger which eventually quieted down to profound sadness My statements havebeen slimmed down to distortion and taken out of context I fought hard during this trial and willnot have the outcome minimized by a probation officer who attempted to evaluate my currentstate and my wishes in a fifteen minute conversation the majority of which was spent answeringquestions I had about the legal system The context is also important Brock had yet to issue astatement and I had not read his remarksMy life has been on hold for over a year a year of anger anguish and uncertainty until a jury ofmy peers rendered a judgment that validated the injustices I had endured Had Brock admittedguilt and remorse and offered to settle early on I would have considered a lighter sentencerespecting his honesty grateful to be able to move our lives forward Instead he took the risk ofgoing to trial added insult to injury and forced me to relive the hurt as details about my personallife and sexual assault were brutally dissected before the public He pushed me and my familythrough a year of inexplicable unnecessary suffering and should face the consequences ofchallenging his crime of putting my pain into question of making us wait so long for justiceI told the probation officer I do not want Brock to rot away in prison I did not say he does notdeserve to be behind bars The probation officers recommendation of a year or less in county jailis a soft time-out a mockery of the seriousness of his assaults and of the consequences of thepain I have been forced to endure I also told the probation officer that what I truly wanted wasfor Brock to get it to understand and admit to his wrongdoingUnfortunately after reading the defendants statement I am severely disappointed and feel thathe has failed to exhibit sincere remorse or responsibility for his conduct I fully respected hisright to a trial but even after twelve jurors unanimously convicted him guilty of three feloniesall he has admitted to doing is ingesting alcohol Someone who cannot take full accountabilityfor his actions does not deserve a mitigating sentence It is deeply offensive that he would try anddilute rape with a suggestion of promiscuity By definition rape is the absence of promiscuityrape is the absence of consent and it perturbs me deeply that he cant even see that distinctionThe probation officer factored in that the defendant is youthful and has no prior convictions Inmy opinion he is old enough to know what he did was wrong When you are eighteen in thiscountry you can go to war When you are nineteen you are old enough to pay the consequencesfor attempting to rape someone He is young but he is old enough to know betterAs this is a first offense I can see where leniency would beckon On the other hand as a societywe cannot forgive everyones first sexual assault or digital rape It doesnt make sense Theseriousness of rape has to be communicated clearly we should not create a culture that suggestswe learn that rape is wrong through trial and error The consequences of sexual assault needs tobe severe enough that people feel enough fear to exercise good judgment even if they are drunksevere enough to be preventative The fact that Brock was a star athlete at a prestigiousuniversity should not be seen as an entitlement to leniency but as an opportunity to send a strongcultural message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social classThe probation officer weighed the fact that he has surrendered a hard earned swimmingscholarship If I had been sexually assaulted by an un-athletic guy from a community college what would his sentence be If a first time offender from an underprivileged background wasaccused of three felonies and displayed no accountability for his actions other than drinkingwhat would his sentence be How fast he swims does not lessen the impact of what happened tomeThe Probation Officer has stated that this case when compared to other crimes of similar naturemay be considered less serious due to the defendants level of intoxication It felt serious Thatsall Im going to sayHe is a lifetime sex registrant That doesnt expire Just like what he did to me doesnt expire forever changed the way I carry myself the way I live the rest of my lifeA year has gone by and he has had lots of time on his hands Has he been seeing a psychologistWhat has he done in this past year to show hes been progressing If he says he wants toimplement programs what has he done to show for itThroughout incarceration I hope he is provided with appropriate therapy and resources to rebuildhis life I request that he educates himself about the issue of campus sexual assault I hope heaccepts proper punishment and pushes himself to reenter society as a better personTo conclude I want to say thank you To everyone from the intern who made me oatmeal when Iwoke up at the hospital that morning to the deputy who waited beside me to the nurses whocalmed me to the detective who listened to me and never judged me to my advocates who stoodunwaveringly beside me to my therapist who taught me to find courage in vulnerability to myboss for being kind and understanding to my incredible parents who teach me how to turn paininto strength to my friends who remind me how to be happy to my boyfriend who is patient andloving to my unconquerable sister who is the other half of my heart to Alaleh my idol whofought tirelessly and never doubted me Thank you to everyone involved in the trial for their timeand attention Thank you to girls across the nation that wrote cards to my DA to give to me somany strangers who cared for meMost importantly thank you to the two men who saved me who I have yet to meet I sleep withtwo bicycles that I drew taped above my bed to remind myself there are heroes in this story Thatwe are looking out for one another To have known all of these people to have felt theirprotection and love is something I will never forgetAnd finally to girls everywhere I am with you On nights when you feel alone I am with youWhen people doubt you or dismiss you I am with you I fought everyday for you So never stopfighting I believe you Lighthouses dont go running all over an island looking for

valued respected undeniably every minute of every day you are powerful and nobodycan take that away from you To girls everywhere I am with you Thank youDonald Trumps presidential campaign fired its Virginia state co-chairman Corey Stewart on Monday after he took part in a protest in front of Republican National Committee headquarters a move with repercussions in both the national campaign and the 2017 governors race The messy parting of ways came just weeks before the election and was the latest sign of turmoil in a campaign that has recently been in a free-fall Stewart and senior Trump campaign officials blamed each other for problems in Virginia where polls show Democrat Hillary Clinton leads comfortably Former Virginia State Chairman Corey Stewart is no longer affiliated with the Donald J Trump for President campaign said Trumps deputy campaign manager David Bossie in a statement He is being replaced effective immediately Corey made this decision when he staged a stunt in front of the RNC without the knowledge or the approval of the Trump campaignStewart acknowledged that he was let go for supporting the rally in front of RNC headquarters in the District which was aimed at warning the national party against abandoning Trump He said he did not organize the rally but wholeheartedly backed it and helped spread the word about it Shortly before the rally began Bossie texted warning him to stop the rally Stewart said He threatened me Stewart said I let everybody know he was threatening me They said there are going to be dire consequences unless I shut down the rally Stewart said he did not respond to the message but knew that it meant that he would be fired if he went forward with his plans He went ahead to make his point that establishment Republicans  he referred to them at the event and on Facebook as establishment pukes  were trying to undermine TrumpStewart said he never heard back from the campaign afterward and only learned from a media report that he had been firedI wanted to call them out and look theres not a lot of time left Stewart said The truth needs to be told Paul Ryan the Mitt Romneys the Reince Priebuses they dont want Trump to win Theyre sabotaging the campaignStewart was the only prominent Virginia Republican to defend Trump after the release last week of a video in which the presidential candidate made lewd remarks about women Trump acted like a frat boy as a lot of guys do he said at the time Stewart complained that money raised by Republicans in Virginia was spent by the RNC on down-ticket races in other statesWeve been raising money in Virginia for Trump and the RNC has broken all its promises to help its campaign in Virginia because Virginia doesnt have any critical down-ticket races he saidThe RNC chairman Reince Priebus pledged complete loyalty to Trump in a Monday conference call with RNC members and swatted down rumors the national party was redirecting its resources to down-ballot races according to a person on the callWere putting together a very strong effort in Virginia Clearly Mr Stewart was more concerned about his own personal agenda than the campaign of Mr Trump said Trump spokesman Jason Miller Stewart said he will continue to support Trump blaming Bossie for his firing and for what Stewart described as Trumps waning fortunes in VirginiaDavid Bossies been a real problem Stewart said Bossie basically refused to support the efforts in Virginia I can say this now because Im not a member of the campaign anymoreStewart claimed the campaign invested nothing in Virginia We couldnt even get signs We couldnt get literature to go door knocking with until recently  Stewart originally served as Trumps campaign chairman while John Fredericks a conservative Virginia radio host was vice chairman A few weeks ago the titles changed so that Stewart and Fredericks were both identified as co-chairs I will continue in the role as co-chairman and spokesperson of the Trump campaign in Virginia as of right now Fredericks said No decision has been made at this timeFredericks said Stewart had participated in the rally to boost his own profile ahead of his gubernatorial bid in Virginia next year  despite warning that he risked further alienating establishment Republicans from TrumpBehavior like we saw today with this protest is simply counter to winning Virginias 13 electoral votes Fredericks said It didnt gain us one vote Its alienating people It makes no sense The Trump campaign has struggled to implement an effective ground game in key swing states such as Virginia The responsibility had largely fallen on the RNC Compared with the Democrats the Republicans have been slower to open up field offices across the countryWith his actions Monday Stewart could endear himself to conservative Republicans as he seeks his partys nomination for governor in 2017 But the strategy is not without risks particularly since the GOP has decided to pick its nominee in a statewide primary which tends to favor more moderate candidates instead of a closed convention As the elected chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors Stewart drew national attention a decade ago promoting a crackdown on undocumented immigrants a policy that presaged the tempest caused by Trumps own anti- immigrant barbs At his urging Prince William authorized police officers to check the immigration status of anyone they detained After a public uproar the county watered down the policy so that an immigration check would be done only after an arrestI was Trump before Trump was Trump Stewart has frequently boasted  In June Stewart wholeheartedly backed Trumps  of a federal judge presiding over a fraud case against the now-defunct Trump University even as some leading Republicans condemned Trumps comments    Stewart was the rare Virginia Republican willing to back Trump well before the real estate mogul locked up the nomination with other elected officials staying neutral in the primary or backing other contenders They seemed well suited to each other both of them blunt-talking foes of illegal immigration But at times Stewarts rhetoric pushed the limits even for Team TrumpIn July Trumps campaign disavowed comments Stewart made on Facebook which placed responsibility for a police massacre in Dallas on Clinton and another Democrat Virginia Lt Gov Ralph Northam Like Stewart Northam is running for governor in 2017     Philip Rucker and Robert Costa contributed to this report
