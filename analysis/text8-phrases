 For the first time we have a figure from the 2016 Trump campaign who we know is cooperating with special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III in his Russia investigation George_Papadopoulos is talkingExactly what that means we dont really knowBut thats just one of several big juicy questions emanating from The document is filled with anonymous campaign officials on the other end of Papadopouloss emails We now know who a few of them are thanks to but a few big ones are still unknown In many cases aides seem to have known about contacts with Russia that the campaign and its principals including President Trump would later denyBelow are four big questions we have in light of and three that have been answeredAt the very end the indictment says Papadopoulos was arrested at Dulles International Airport in suburban Washington on July 27 of this year It says he has talked with the governmenton numerous occasions to provide information and answer questionsItis suspected that the special_counsel is trying to flip Paul_Manafort and get him to cooperate via his own indictment Papadopoulos was far_less central to the campaign but here we actually have someone who is cooperatingWhat did he agree to share in his plea deal And what does he even to share This may be the biggest question of allThe indictment says Papadopoulos attended a national_security meeting about March 31 with Trump and other foreign_policy advisers for the campaignIt saysPapadopoulos told the group that he had connections and could arrange a Trump-Putin meetingThe text doesnt technically saywhether Trump was present when this claim was made But if he was it would render Trumps own denials of his campaigns contactwith Russia pretty dishonestThe campaign and the White_House have The denials even came from Trump himself and Vice_President Pence But this particular set of emails (and more to come below) suggests that several members of the campaign were aware of contacts discussing a desire on behalf of the Russian_government to broker a meetingWhite House_press secretary_Sarah Huckabee_Sanders said Monday she was not sure that the president recalls specific details of the meetingThis is yet_another high-level aide who would have known there was contact with Russia Papadopoulos told this adviser on April 25 that these governments tend to speak a bit more openly in neutral cities playing up his own stationing in LondonIt may be neither here nor there in this whole sequence but Papadopoulos seems to have believed at one point that the unnamed London professor introduced him to Putins_niece identifying her as such in an email to the campaignHe later says it wasnt actually Putins nieceBut who was it And did Papadopoulos not seek to verify this information Or was he trying to inflate his connections in the email Its all very strangeAnd below are the questions The_Post has been able to answerAfter a March 24 2016 meeting with the unnamed London professor and an unnamed Russian national whom Papadopoulos at one point believed to be Vladimir Putins_niece Papadopoulos_emailed a campaign supervisor and several members of the campaigns foreign_policy team according to the document He told them the meeting was to set_up another meeting between the campaign and Russian leadership to discuss US-Russia ties under President TrumpThe campaign supervisor at this point replied Great workLater about June 1 Papadopoulos_emailed the same supervisor to say that a Russian MFA wanted to set_up a meeting between Trump and Putin The supervisor urged Papadopoulos to make the trip with another foreign_policy adviser insteadIn a tantalizing footnote someone described as a high-ranking official on the Trump campaign forwarded a Papadopoulos email to another official in late May and said We_need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips It should be someone low_level in the campaign so as not to send any signalSo yet again we have a top official in the campaign who was aware of Papadopoulosscontacts with Russia Papadopoulos titled the email Request from Russia and thought it through enough to offer a different course of action Along with the supervisor and members of the foreign_policy team above thats another apparently high-ranking Trump campaign official who knew about this How could the campaign and White_House go on to deny such contactsAlso juicy here What does so as not to send any signal mean Some see that as a potential tell when it comes to a larger effort to coordinate with the Russians which is the big unanswered question in this whole investigation But it could also simply be that they didnt want to telegraph a close alliance with Russia which could have been politically problematicThis is a different high-ranking official from the one mentioned above But its another person who apparently knew based on multiple emails about what the campaign and White_House would later denyThe 18th and 19th of each month were busy days at the Woori bank branch in the Kaesong industrial complexSalaries for the 54000 North_Koreans who worked in the interKorean economic_zone on the northern side of the demilitarized zone that separates the estranged countries were due by the 20thSo the managers of the 123 South_Korean companies operating there would head to the Woori branch a couple of days before to withdraw cash Always in US dollars and usually in $100 or $50 notesEvery month the accountant would tally the hours of each worker and each worker would check their hours and sign a list said Ok Sung-seok head of Nine Mode a clothing company that hired 300 North_Koreans until The manager of the factory would go to the Woori branch in Kaesong and take out the money in US dollars Ok said The cost for hiring each worker was between $180 and $200 a monthThen with the cash in an Woori bank paper bag the company representative would drive five_minutes down the road to a management office and hand over the cash to the North_Korean officials thereFor more_than a decade South_Korean companies have been handing over bags of greenbacks to the North_Korean regime in this wayWhen it was opened in 2004 the idea was that the Kaesong industrial complex would help lessen the economic gap_between North and South and at the same_time expose a few isolated North_Koreans to the outside_world The government theory went that these benefits outweighed concerns about what the north might do with the moneyBut now that has all changedPark Geun-hye the South_Korean president has acted with unusual decisiveness and acted alone following her gut instinct advisers say to in the wake of North_Koreas nuclear and missile_tests and with it the sunshine_policy era of engagementShes the president The buck stops with her said a senior government official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberationsIn an address last_week that the money South_Korea was sending through Kaesong was helping the runaway Kim_Jong Un regime This echoes what critics of the project had been saying for a decadeSouth Koreas government estimates that it has sent more_than half a billion dollars to North_Korea through Kaesong over the past 12 years including $120 million last_year alone By the time it closed this month 54000 North_Koreans were working in 124 Southern-owned factories in the zone making an average of about $160 a monthThey did_not receive any of the money instead being paid in vouchers that they could use in local stores No ones knows what proportion of the monthly payment each worker received but the Daily NK a South_Korean website with sources inside the North or about $30The $560 million sent through Kaesong was in addition to the $487 million it sent through the Kumgangsan tourist resort in the years it was open according to unification ministry statistics and the $22 billion in fertilizer rice and disaster assistance from South to North since the mid-1990sParks decision to end the last major engagement project with North_Korea was the result not just of North_Koreas actions but also of ChinasIn the three years since she took_office Park has made concerted efforts to woo China including risking annoying Washington by attending a military extravaganza in Beijing last_year Yet after North_Korea conducted its nuclear_test at the beginning of January Chinese President_Xi Jinping refused to take a phone_call from Park for a month according to multiple people with knowledge of the situation When they finally talked the Chinese leader didnt say anything that hadnt already been said in the official media anything that couldnt have been said the day of the test said one person who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversationsParks decision to close Kaesong and also to open discussions with the United_States about hosting an that China staunchly opposes is meant as a signal that South_Korea will do everything it can to punish North_Korea and it expects other countries to do what they can analysts sayChina which shares a long border with North_Korea is by far its largest trading partner and therefore has the most leverage_over its errant neighborThe Kaesong complex was shut_down once before by North_Korea which withdrew its workers during a period of heightened tensions in 2013 But experts think that this time the closure is permanentRealistically its closed for good said Lee Jong-seok who was South_Koreas minister of unification during the sunshine_policy years and remains a strong proponent of engagement Now that the South_Korean government has alleged that the money is going into North_Koreas nuclear_program theres no way they can reopen thisPark had tried to find a middle ground between the sunshine_policy and the hard-line tendencies of her predecessor pursuing what she called a trustpolitik approach to North_Korea a combination of carrots and sticks But the nuclear_test and missile_launch forced her to call an end to this approachShes come to realize that trustpolitik doesnt work said Chun Yung-woo national_security adviser to Parks predecessor and an advocate of a much tougher approach to the North Shes now decided to speak the language that North_Korea understands the language of sanctions and regime change Yoonjung_Seo contributed to this reportAfter the historic ouster of on Friday scandal-weary South Koreans began turning their attention to a new election due within 60days and to the prospect that her successor could try to reset relations with neighboring North_Korea and its powerful patron China In the three months since Park was suspended over corruption allegations plunging the country into limbo amid protracted impeachment proceedings the regime in North_Korea has launched five and is accused of of the leaders half brotherAdd to that Chinas anger over the deployment of a US to South_Korea and uncertainty about President Trumps administration in Washington and the lack of leadership in South_Korea could hardly have come at a more sensitive time A political vacuum like this in a key ally that borders a major nuclear threat is not good for the US said John Delury an American political_scientist in Seoul I_think its been underestimated as a danger and as a destabilizing factorSecretary of State_Rex Tillerson will encounter this problem firsthand when he arrives in Seoul next week for discussions about North_Korea with a South_Korean counterpart who is on his way out Tillerson will also hear about the rise of a progressive candidate whose approach toward China and North_Korea could differ sharply from that of the impeached president and from the stance of the United StatesThe Trump administration is conducting a policy review to decide how to deal with North_Koreas threats and there is plenty of talk in Washington about kinetic options a euphemism for some kind of military action Meanwhile in Tokyo some ruling-party lawmakers are openly pushing for Japan to develop the capacity to preemptively strike North KoreaThat is the kind of talk that South_Korea should be shutting down Delury said In_addition to its nuclear and missile_programs North_Korea has conventional artillery lined up along the demilitarized zone and aimed_at Seoul a metropolis of 25million peopleThe role of a South_Korean president whether liberal or conservative is to be the person who gently takes that option off the table Delury said referring to a preemptive strike The South_Korean president has to be saying If you take out their missile pad they take out our capital But that hasnt been happeningPark was immediately dismissed from office Friday after South_Koreas Constitutional_Court upheld a legislative impeachment motion ruling unanimously that she had continuously broken the law Elections will be held in early May and the latest opinion polls show Moon Jae-in a progressive who unsuccessfully challenged Park for the presidency in 2012 holding a strong leadMoon favors the sunshine_policy of engagement with North_Korea the liberal idea from the late 1990s that engagement can help open up the closed state and narrow the gap_between the two KoreasThis sunshine_policy ended in 2008 with the election of a conservative president who took a tough approach toward North_Korea a stance maintained by ParkFollowing North_Koreas nuclear_test at the beginning of last_year Parks government that was the linchpin of the sunshine_policy accusing the North of using South_Korean cash from economic engagement projects to bankroll its weapons programsMoon however has said he would like to resume engagement with North_Korea and would go to Pyongyang for talks with its leaderIf Moon wins the general election he will emphasize South_Koreas alliance with the US and a strong defense posture said Lee Chung-min a professor of international relations at Yonsei University But his heart will lie in fostering deeper engagement with the North and negotiating an early summit with Kim_Jong UnMoon has also signaled an openness to reviewing the Park governments agreement to host the United_States Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defense_(THAAD) antimissile_battery The agreement was reached last_year to protect against North_Korean missiles and the system was due to arrive in South_Korea this summer But in a surprise announcement the Pentagon said the first shipment arrived in South_Korea on MondayThis has sparked widespread speculation in South_Korea that the United_States expected Park to be impeached and wanted to make the deployment more difficult to reverse The US military command in South_Korea said the deployment was being carried_out according to scheduleChina has vehemently objected to the arrival of THAAD in the region viewing the deployment as a US attempt to keep China not just North_Korea in check To prod Seoul to change its mind Beijing has imposed painful restrictions on South_Korean imports ranging from toilet seats to pop musicWe are all very clear that the crux of the problem between China and South_Korea is that South_Korea is ignoring Chinas concerns and is deploying the THAAD antimissile_system with the United_States Chinese Foreign_Ministry spokesman_Geng Shuang said FridayWe once_again urge South_Korea to focus on the interests of the Chinese and Korean people he saidBut analysts say that even if the progressive Moon becomes South_Koreas next president he will face difficulties in backtracking on THAAD or returning to the sunshine policyWhile China might expect a U-turn over THAAD if Moon becomes president it will be extremely difficult for Moon to do that since THAAD is being placed primarily for the defense of the United_States forces in Korea said Lee the Yonsei professor Despite Moons inclination to oppose THAAD_deployment he will not undo it at the expense of worsening ties with Trump just as Moon begins his term in office Lee saidLikewise it would be difficult to go back to the kind of sunshine_policy of previous liberal presidents said Robert Kelly of Pusan National University I dont_think there is much support for major engagement any more he saidThis is partly because public opinion has changed dramatically thanks to two North_Korean attacks in 2010 that left more_than 50 South Koreans dead as well as the Park governments assertion that engagement money was funding weapons developmentI think Moon would have to fight hard to get that kind of engagement off the ground hed be pushing against the Americans and against his own people Kelly saidBut for South Koreans who wanted Park out there is a sense of opportunityToday is just the beginning said Kim Kyoung a housewife who attended every rally against the impeached president and returned to central Seoul on Friday night to celebrate Parks departure South_Korea developed very quickly but now we have an opportunity to move slowly and help our democracy mature Congcong_Zhang in Beijing contributed to this reportOnthe brand-new political news website the headlines could have been ripped from a speech by President Trump Immigrants commit more crime Syrian refugees are raping girls and Muslim education is taking over the school system But the two-month-old Gatestone Europe website is based in the Netherlands the contributors are Dutch And their aim their editor says is to swing the debate ahead of European elections this year to deliver a tide of anti-immigrant leaders to office in the Netherlands France Germany and elsewhereWebsites that focus on the perils of open borders immigration and international alliancesare expanding in scope and ambition in Europe seeing a once-in-a-generation opportunity to harness the energy from Trumps win to drive deep into a continent where traditional political parties are struggling Some of the websites are registered in Russia Others like Gatestone Europe are being supported by Americans with ties to TrumpIn the Netherlands someonline activists are backing a handful of anti-Muslim candidates including the fiery Geert Wilders who is running in a dead heat against the ruling party ahead of March15 elections In France news blogs are spreading innuendo about the rivals of the anti-immigrant Marine Le_Pen who is the most popular presidential_candidate in the lead-up to the election in April and May And in Germany some ofthe outlets have spread false stories about refugees raping people that were repeated by the Russian foreign_minister Fed by public anger about refugees the Muslim-bashing Alternative for Germany party is poised to seize seats in Germanys Parliament in SeptemberTheres quite a lot of news quite shocking often with rape or violence and immigrants said Timon Dias 29 who started Gatestone Europe last_month after several years of writing for a different anti-establishmentwebsite in the Netherlands We want people to learn whats_happening in Europe and vote accordingly especially ahead of elections this yearAlthough many of the sites are small the Amsterdam-based Gatestone Europe has only four writers and no office they do not need to be well established to score big on Facebook or Twitter A spicy individual post can go viral with little regard for the history of the outletIts a crowbar in the system Dias said The main line is highly vigilant highly critical about what the effects are of having a significant Muslim minority in the inner cities The project is funded by the New York-based Gatestone Institute which is chaired by former UN ambassador John Bolton who was a finalist in Trumps search for a new national_security adviserContacted for comment the Gatestone Institute made available one of its board members retired Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz who said that the organization is nonpartisan and that its aim is tomove the debate to the center Bolton did_not reply to a request for commentAs with other similar sites many of Gatestones posts are based on true events spun aggressively to feed the narrative that mainstream pro-European Union politicians are selling out their countries to immigrants The site does_not support any one candidate in the Dutch elections but the anti-EU leader of the small Forum for Democracy party Thierry Baudet is a contributorWe report the news to our readers in a directed way Dias saidAlthough Wilders is likely to face trouble forming a coalition and Le_Pen is forecast to lose the second round of Frances presidential_election both candidates have had success in shifting debate in their nations onto more anti-immigrant Euroskeptic ground Far-right websites are often their megaphoneIn the Netherlands similar news_outlets have already made successful forays into Dutch political lifeA referendum last_year on whether the Dutch government should ratify a trade deal with Ukraine was triggered by a far-right news site GeenStijlThe eventual rejection of the trade deal turned into an embarrassing defeat for the Dutch government which was forced to backpedal on its commitment to Ukraine Opponents of the trade deal including GeenStijl cited an opposition to EU expansion and a desire not to antagonize the Kremlin as reasons to vote it downPro-Ukraine-deal campaigners say they suspect that the Kremlin put a finger on the scale by supporting activists and pro-Russian trolls online although no link has been proved The activists including GeenStijl deny any connectionBut even absent ties to Russia the news sites demonstrated a powerful ability to disrupt the pro-EU agenda of the Dutch mainstream creating a political headache for Dutch leaders and feeding Western disunity that coincides with Kremlin effortsThe Ukraine referendum has shown what kind of mayhem they can cause said Cas Mudde a Dutch scholar of far-right movements at the University of Georgia What impressed a lot of people was their ability to mobilize people who were commenting on websites to go out and actually vote for a cause People werent expecting thatNow GeenStijls political arm GeenPeil Dutch for no poll has spun off into a political party and is contesting the parliamentary election on the promise to hold Dutch leaders accountableUntil my generation everybody had a better life than their parents That has stopped said Jan Dijkgraaf 54 a former journalist who is now the leader of GeenPeilHe said he did_not consider himself a far-right politician but he seized on immigration as a major focus for Dutch votersDijkgraaf said he could understand if a mother of three needed temporary refuge from war But when there are boys of 25 with these kind of muscles you have to think are they really victims of a war or do they have plans to get rich or to do something like in Brussels or in ParisThe Ukraine referendum sparked a number of political parties most of which have struggled to break through Wilderss lock on anti-immigrant discourse in the NetherlandsWilders was using Twitter to spark outrage and publicity long before Trump turned to electoral politics A tweet last_month of a leading political opponent Alexander Pechtold Photoshopped into a pro-sharia demonstration in London dominated political coverage for days Wilders later acknowledged that the photo was fake but said Pechtold had recently been to a similar demonstrationThey dont care about what is really true what is a little true or what is fake Pechtold said And thats of course what we have seen in the United StatesIn the far-right Web universe the faked picture caused no uproarIts a way of speaking to people said Bert Brussen editor of ThePostOnline another far-right website where headlines on recent articles have included Iraqis on Trial for Gang Rape in Vienna and Massacre by Islamic terror was again prevented in GermanyA lot of what Wilders says its Internet language Brussen said The Internet makes them stronger and they make the Internet strongerIn other countries with elections this year far-right sites are also thriving attracting the attention of some of the American outlets that helped propel Trump to victory Last year Breitbart_News whose former head Stephen_K Bannon is now Trumps chief_strategist said that it would take the plunge into the French and German markets although there is so_far little sign that it is readying to openBut anti-establishment activists in those countries may need little helpIn France where far-right candidate Le_Pen wants to take a hard line against Muslim immigration hold a referendum on EU membership and embrace relations with the Kremlin far-right news sites have taken aim at whichever candidate appears most_likely to challenge her in the final round of the presidential_election due to be held May 7 (Le Pen is expected to win the first round)For months that was center-right candidate Franois Fillon More recently a surge from the centrist Emmanuel Macronhas drawn a volley of darts from rumor-mongering websites some of them branches of Russian state media Macron recently took on the rumors joking that his apparent ability tohave gay affairs puzzled his wife who is usually by his sideAnd in Germany and Austria experts say roughly 30 German-language alternative websites are currently operating Many have existed for years butthey have transformed into machines to undermine traditional politicians especially since the start of Europes refugee crisisThe majority of them experts say tend to have opaque ownership structures making it difficult to ascertain who is behind them They are almost universally pro-Russian in tone and some of the German-language sites areoperated from Russian servers though direct links to the Russian_government are hard to findThey publish stories with a true core building their own atmosphere around this core what we call hybrid fake said Andre Wolf a spokesman for Mimikama an Austria-based fact-checking websiteMany stories seem aimed_at undermining German Chancellor_Angela Merkels bid for reelection on Sept24 But as a center-left challenger Martin Schulz rose in the polls in recent_weeks along surged a flurry of fake reports

to colleagues Monday that he is stepping down amid a series of indictments that cast a shadow on work his firm had done with Paul_Manafort that may have benefited a Ukrainian regime friendly to the Kremlin The Podesta_Group is not named in the newly released indictments but the company is one of two indirectly referenced in the charges Podesta and another lobbying firm Mercury Public_Affairs were working with Manafort and his partner_Rick Gates from 2012-2014 in lobbying to improve the image of the Ukrainian government In the indictment the firms are referred to as Company_A and Company_B according to people_familiar with the companies involvementManafort and Gates turned themselves in to federal authorities Monday while facing a 12-count_indictment on various charges including misleading the government about their secret work for a foreign government Later in the day Podesta announced his resignation at a staff meeting at the Podesta Groups Washington headquartersIt is impossible to run a public affairs firm while you are under attack by Fox_News and the right wing media he told his former employees according to a person_familiar with his remarks Podesta is the brother of John_Podesta a longtime Democratic adviser who led the presidential campaign of Hillary_Clinton The resignation of one of Washingtons most prominent Democratic lobbyists shows how the investigation of special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III is reverberating throughout both partiesIts unclear how_much the Podesta_Group or its principal founder knew about the funding for the client they represented The Podesta_Group and Mercury claimed in lobbying disclosure reports that they represented a Brussels-based nonprofit the European Center for a Modern Ukraine that sought to help Ukraine improve its image in the West from 2012 to 2014 However behind the scenes the lobbying work was being directed by Manafort and Gates prosecutors allege Their real client was the government of Ukraine the indictment says Gates and Manafort for many years represented the Party of Regions a Russia-friendly political organization in Ukraine that was led by Viktor_Yanukovych former president of the Ukraine In 2012 Manafort and Gates solicited two Washington DC firms (Company A and Company B) to lobby in the US on behalf of Yanukovych and the Party of Regions and the Government of Ukraine The Podesta_Group fully disclosed its representation of the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine and complied with federal disclosure laws by filing under the lobbying disclosure act over five_years ago said Molly Levinson a spokeswoman for the firm in a statement The Podesta_Group has fully cooperated with the Special_Counsels office and taken every possible step to provide documentation that confirms compliance with the law Based on our due diligence and on the recommendation of definitive legal experts the firm filed the appropriate public disclosures of its representation of the ECFMU over five_years ago and in eight subsequent public filings The Podesta Groups work for ECFMU a nonprofit was in support of Ukraines admission to the EU a position supported by foreign_policy experts at the time The ECFMU provided formal certification that it was neither funded by nor directed by a government or political party A Mercury partner Michael McKeon issued a statement Monday afternoon acknowledging the firms representation of the Center Mercury worked for the ECFMU with the intention of aligning Ukraine with western democracies generally McKeon wrote Mercury retained a lawyer to determine the proper method of disclosure of such representation and followed the advice he said noting that the company has previously filed under lobbying and foreign-agents disclosure laws Mercury takes its obligations to follow all laws rules and regulations very seriously Mercury has and will_continue to fully cooperate with the Office of the Special Counsel he wrote While claiming that the European Center for a Modern Ukraine was the client that organization was actually under the ultimate direction of the Government of Ukraine Yanukovych and the Party of Regions the indictment said Company_A and Company_B were paid for their services not by their nominal client the Centre but solely through off-shore accounts associated with the Manafort-Gates entitiesThe Podesta_Group and Mercury came into focus for prosecutors as they delved deeply into Manaforts finances earlier_this yearThe way the South_Korean government tells it North_Korea is on the brink of collapse A collapse in no small part being brought about by the tough actions of the South_Korean governmentBarely a week goes by without a report of cracks in Kim_Jong Uns_regime This weeks report concerns the alleged execution of a vice premier and the banishment of two other senior officialsA spokesman for South_Koreas Unification Ministry said Wednesday that Kim Yong Jin who served as North_Koreas education minister and then as a deputy prime_minister Why and when Inappropriate to say on both counts he saidBut Seoul confirmed his execution through various channels said the spokesman Jeong Joon-hee South_Korean reports suggested that the vice premier was branded an anti-party and anti-revolutionary element and killed by firing squad in July after not standing upright at a meeting of the Supreme Peoples AssemblyAt the same_time Jeong said that Kim Yong Chul a hard-liner in charge of inter-Korean relations and Choi Hui vice chief of the propaganda and agitation department were sent to the countryside for reeducationThis was the latest installment in Seouls narrative that Kim_Jong Uns grip is weakeningPrevious chapters include the recent defection of the deputy North_Korean ambassador in London because he was sick and tired of the system and reports that a North_Korean official based in Southeast Asia and tasked with making money for the leadership had defected with bags of cash Add to that the mass defection of 13 workers from a North_Korean restaurant in China This all conveniently comes after President Park Geun-hyes administration in Seoul took surprisingly harsh steps to punish Pyongyang for its January nuclear_test in particular then supporting tough international sanctionsThe South_Korean president has been quick to draw a line linking all these events saying last_week that serious cracks were appearing in North_Korea and that elite defections could be a sign that the system is shakingBut South_Korean intelligence has a record of being right as often as it is wrong a early this year showed up at a party congress in May and of being used for political purposesSome analysts wonder whether thats what is happening nowI think its clear that when it suits the South_Korean governments purposes information is shared with the media said Scott A Snyder a Korea expert at the Council on Foreign_Relations So how reflective are these reports of whats_happening in North_Korea We dont always knowAlmost since the establishment of North_Korea as a Soviet client state 70 years_ago government officials and analysts have been predicting its imminent demiseWhile most analysts agree that sudden changes such as the latest ones probably reflect stresses within North_Koreas senior ranks there is wide variation in interpretation Some say executions and purges are a sign of instability but others say they are a sign of strength because Kim_Jong Un is consolidating his leadershipThe regime probably does face some pressures but the overall internal trajectory over the past three or four years has been one of consolidation and efforts to impose even higher tests of loyalty Snyder said Id say it was a sign of instability if disloyalty went unpunished Totalitarian states like the one that Kim_Jong Un inherited retain control through a reign of terror using executions and purges to keep the elite in line and more general repression and limits on information to keep the wider society under controlThe current leaders father Kim_Jong Il executed more_than 2000 officials between 1994 and 2000 said Cheong Seong-chang a respected North Korea-watcher at the Sejong Institute outside SeoulKim Jong_Un has had about 130 officials put to death since he took over the helm of the country from his father almost five_years ago according to a tally by South_Koreas Yonhap_News AgencyNotable among those executed are Kims own uncle Jang Sung Thaek put to death in 2013 for apparently amassing too_much power and wealth and the Kim Yong-hyun professor in North_Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul said that some shake-up was to be expected after Kim_Jong Un held a Workers_Party Congress in May the first since 1980A wide reshuffling of the North_Korean elite has taken place as part of the process of building Kim_Jong Uns system he said adding that the execution could have served as a warning to others in North_Koreas top tierWhile high-level defections are embarrassing for Pyongyang and officials running off with money meant for the leadership will inflict some pain neither presents an existential threat for North_Korea said Christopher Green a North_Korea researcher at Leiden University in the NetherlandsAs with so many things about North_Korea the present picture will be clear only with hindsight There could be cracks in the regime and it could be about to collapse but the thing is no one actually knows Green said Yoonjung_Seo in Seoul contributed to this reportXandra Lammers lives on an island in Amsterdam the back door of her modern and spacious four-bedroom house opening onto a graceful canal where ducks swans and canoes glide byThe translation business she and her_husband run from their home is thriving The neighborhood is booming with luxury homes going up as fast as workers can build them a quietly efficient tramway to speed residents to work in the world-renowned city center and parks bike paths art galleries beaches and cafes all within a short ambleBy outward appearances Lammers is living the Dutch dream But in the 60-year-olds telling she has been dropped into the middle of a nightmare one in which Western civilization is under assault from the Muslim immigrants who have become her neighborsThe influx has been too_much The borders should close said Lammers soft-spoken with pale blue eyes and brown hair that frames a deceptively serene-looking face If this continues our culture will cease to existTo Europes powers that be the threat looks dramatically different but no less grave If enough voters agree with Lammers and support the far right in elections here on Wednesday and then its modern Europe itself defined by cooperation openness and multicultural pluralism that could come crashing down The stakes have risen sharply as Europeans anti-establishment anger has swelled In interviews across the Netherlands in recent_days far-right voters expressed stridently nationalist anti-immigrant views that were long considered fringe but that have now entered the Dutch mainstreamVoters young and old rich and poor urban and rural said they would back the Geert Wilders-led Freedom_Party no_longer the preserve of the left-behinds which promises to solve the countrys problems by shutting borders closing mosques and helping to dismantle the European UnionTheyve found a very powerful narrative said Koen Damhuis a researcher at the European University Institute who studies the far right By creating a master conflict of the national versus the foreign theyre able to attract support from all elements of societyAlong the way Europes old assurances have been swept aside The far right may exist the continents political establishment has long told itself but a virtuous brew of growing economic prosperity increased cross-border integration and rising education levels would blunt its appeal Most important all the pungent memory of the nationalist rights last turn in power would keep it from ever gaining control in Europe againBut in 2017 every one of those assumptions is being challenged perhaps even explodedAfter the transatlantic jolts of and Donald Trump last_year continental Europe is bracing for a possible string of paradigm-rattling firsts in its postwar history In France has a credible shot at a triumph in spring presidential elections In Germany appears poised to win seats in the national parliament this fall And here in the Netherlands a man convicted only months_ago of hate speech could wind up on top when votes are counted in next weeks national electionsAt first glance the Netherlands a small nation of 17million that has long punched above its weight on the global stage through seafaring exploration and trade seems an unlikely setting for a populist revoltUnlike in France where the economy continues to stagger nearly a decade on from the global financial_crisis the indicators in the Netherlands are broadly positive falling unemployment healthy growth and relatively low inequality By most measures the Dutch are some of the happiest people on EarthAnd unlike Germany where Chancellor_Angela Merkel opened the countrys borders to a historic influx of refugees in 2015 the Netherlands has been relatively insulated from mass immigration Compared with its neighbors the Dutch took significantly fewer asylum seekers during the refugee crisis and much of the countrys nonnative population settled in the Netherlands decades agoThose differences make it all the more surprising that the far rights message resonates here and hint at just how difficult it could be to halt the global populist waveFor much of the past two years Wilderss Freedom_Party has led the polls though it has recently dropped into a virtual tie with the ruling center rightBecause of the deeply fragmented nature of Dutch politics there will be 28 parties on the ballot Wednesday the Freedom_Party could come out on top with just 20percent of the vote Even if it does it is considered extremely unlikely that Wilders would end up governing because other parties have spurned himBut he has already had an outsize influence forcing rival politicians including the prime_minister Mark Rutte to shift their policies and rhetoric in his directionTo many Wilders supporters the overall picture of a growing economy with a comparatively small number of recent immigrants is beside the point Their reasons for backing the platinum-haired politician who refers to Moroccans as scum and advocates a total ban on Muslim immigration run much deeperThe main issue is identity said Joost Niemller a journalist and author who has written extensively on Wilders and is sympathetic to his cause People feel theyre losing their Dutch identity and Dutch society The neighborhoods are changing Immigrants are coming in And they cant say anything about it because theyll be called racist So they feel helpless Because they feel helpless they get angryAnd today that anger can be found far beyond the poorer less-educated working-class areas where Wilders and his party first gained substantial supportI hear it on the tennis court and at the golf club People dont_want immigrants said Geert Tomlow a former Freedom_Party candidate who fell out with Wilders but still sympathizes with many of his positions One-third of Holland is angry Were angry We dont_want all these changesThat is true even in places where little seems to have changedTeunis Den Hertog a 34-year-old small-business owner lives in a pastoral town that he said is virtually untouched by immigration Ive heard theres a Turkish man who lives here but just outside the town thankfully he saidNonetheless Den Hertog said he wants the government to close the country to new arrivals and reestablish compulsory border checks for the first time in decadesYou can see a vehicle coming with a lot of men with dark skin and pick them out said Den Hertog who grew up poor and one of nine children but now earns enough to afford a comfortable suburban-style house for his family of four Otherwise its just too dangerousDen Hertog said he typically avoids the countrys diverse cosmopolitan cities But Wilders supporters exist there too as Lammers the Amsterdam island resident can attest University-educated financially successful and raised in the culturally progressive firmament of the Netherlands biggest city Lammers had long staked her ground on the left Her father was a regional mayor from the Labour Party and she identified as a supporter well into adulthoodI was very politically correct she said I believed in the social experimentIt was a move up the social ladder that precipitated her shift across the political spectrumIn 2005 she and her_husband bought their home in the Amsterdam neighborhood of IJburg an innovative development built on a cluster of artificial islandsLike many who moved to the neighborhood Lammers and her_husband did so because the area offered bigger houses at lower prices than could be found in the crammed city center And at first it was everything they had hopedIt had a village feeling Everyone knew each_other They put a temporary supermarket in a tent she recalled It was cozyBut then came a surprise Families of Moroccan and Turkish origin started moving in part of a social program to dedicate 30percent of the developments housing to people on low incomes the disabled or the elderlySuddenly she said white Dutch residents had to share their streets gardens and elevators with Muslim women wearing headscarves and men sporting beards Crime noise and litter soon intruded on her urban idyll she saidThe newcomers generally spoke Dutch and many seemed to work But she faulted them for not integrating the evidence of which she said could be found in their traditional dress and attendance at a modest storefront mosqueShe suggested they try church instead though Lammers said she does_not attend (Sometimes on Sunday I watch American church on the television Lammers said Theyre very opposed to Islam I like that)If the newcomers have hurt her neighborhoods desirability its not apparent in the home prices which have sharply risen Nor is it visible on the streets which are clean tidy and on a mild late winters day filled with children of various ethnic backgrounds happily riding scooters and bikes But Lammers remains bitterYou think youre going to live in a well-to-do neighborhood she said But you end up living in a so-called black neighborhood because of the socialist ideologyAmong the beneficiaries of that ideology is one of Lammerss friends Ronald Meulendijks a 44-year-old who has been living on full-time medical disability since he was 29The government pays him the equivalent of $1000 a month and provides him with a steep discount on a light-filled three-bedroom apartment in the heart of IJburg benefits he said he deserves as a native-born Dutchman with a long pedigreeMy whole family of seven generations paid taxes he saidMuslim immigrants and their children by contrast are undeserving he saidWhen I see all the refugees getting everything for free I get very angry I want to throw something at the television said Meulendijks who dotes on his pair of chow-chow rescue dogs and serves visitors to his art-filled apartment copious tea and strawberry pie A government has to treat its own people correctly before accepting new ones First you must take care of your ownAnd if the government fails Meulendijks has dark visions of whats to comeI think Holland will need a civil_war he said between the people who dont belong here and the real peopleTo drive home the point Meulendijks has decorated his panoramic windows with five large posters bearing the face of Wilders and his partys campaign slogan The Netherlands is ours againA pronounced nick in the glass the result of a carefully aimed rock suggests not everyone in the neighborhood agrees with Meulendijkss clash-of-civilizations worldviewNeighbors said they did_not recognize the grim vision of IJburg that Lammers and Meulendijks describedWhich country you come from or which religion you have it doesnt matter here said Iris Scheppingen 41 a resident for the past decade who is raising three children in IJburg The children all play togetherAt a nearby halal pizza restaurant one of the neighborhoods few businesses that explicitly cater to Muslim customers the owner said the area was safe and quiet He said he had never noticed a cultural clashNice people here said 49-year-old Farhad Salimi as his staff of young kitchen workers slung pies and sprinkled toppings Everyone comes here for pizza Immigrants Dutch people Everybody We dont have problemsThe world however was a different storyA refugee from Iran who moved to the Netherlands nearly 30_years ago Salimi said he had seen what religious zealotry and the politics of exclusion did to his native landNow the gray-haired Salimi fears it is happening across the West even in the peaceful and prosperous country that had so enthusiastically welcomed himThe politicians are exploiting divisions turning people against one another for their own gain he said Extremism is rising Where will it endEverywhere he said solemnly is messed up Karla_Adam in London contributed to this reportAs Donald Trump surged in the Republican primary polls in the early months of 2016 his outsider campaign faced growing pressure to show that the former reality-TV star and noted provocateur was forming a coherent and credible world view So when Carter_Page an international businessman with an office near Trump_Tower volunteered his services former officials recall Trump aides were quick to make him feel welcomeHe had come with a referral from the son-in-law of Richard Nixon New_York state Republican_Party Chairman Ed Cox who had conveyed Pages interest to the campaign Cox saidA top Trump adviser Sam_Clovis then employed what campaign aides now acknowledge was their go-to vetting process a quick Google search to check out the newcomer He seemed to have the right qualifications according to former campaign officials head of an energy investment firm business degree from New_York University doctorate from the University of LondonPage was in He joined a new Trump campaign national_security advisory group and in late March_2016 the candidate pointed to Page among others as evidence of a foreign_policy team with gravitasBut what the Google search had not shown was that Page had been on the FBIs radar since at_least 2013 when Russian officials allegedly tried to use him to get information about the energy businessBy the summer of 2016 Page who had been recently named as a Trump adviser was under surveillance by FBI_agents who suspected that he may have been acting as an agent of the KremlinAs part of its broader investigation_into potential collusion_between the Trump campaign and the Russian_government the FBI continues to examine how Page joined the campaign and what conversations he may have had with Russian officials about the effort to interfere with the election with or without the knowledge of Trump and his team according to people_familiar with the matterThe Senate_Intelligence Committee has also zeroed in on Page asking him for records of all his contacts with Russians during the campaign all financial interactions he had with Russia and all communications he had with Trump campaign staffThe circumstances that led to Pages easy access to the Trump campaign represent one of the main questions facing investigators Were Trumps connections to multiple Russia-friendly advisers mere coincidence or evidence of a coordinated attempt to collude with a foreign government Or were they the result of incompetent vetting that left a neophyte candidate vulnerable to influence from people with nefarious agendasRegardless of the answer the campaigns previously unreported procedures for vetting Page and other advisers are greatly complicating matters for Trumps presidency Along with Page a number of other Trump associates are under growing scrutiny by congressional_investigators and the FBI as they examine potential ties_between the campaign and Moscow including former national_security adviser_Michael Flynn onetime campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort and informal Trump adviser Roger StoneThis week former CIA_director John Brennan told the House_Intelligence Committee that in 2016 he had seen intelligence revealing contacts and interactions between Russian officials and US persons involved in the Trump campaign that I was concerned about because of known Russian efforts to suborn such individuals He did_not name the individuals but said that when he stepped_down as CIA_director on Jan 20 he had unresolved questions about whether the Russians had been successful in getting campaign associates to work on their behalf in a witting or unwitting fashionMultiple people_familiar with campaign operations most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations said that Page and others were brought into the fold at a time of desperation for the Trump team As Trump was starting to win primaries he was under increasing pressure to show that he had a legitimate presidential-caliber national_security team The problem he faced was that most mainstream national_security experts wanted nothing to do with himEveryone did their best but there was not as much vetting as there could have been former campaign_manager Corey_Lewandowski saidAnother longtime campaign official put it this way Anyone who came to us with a pulse a rsum and seemed legit would be welcomedWe were not exactly making due diligence the highest priority another campaign veteran addedA White_House spokeswoman referred questions to Trumps campaign Michael Glassner who currently serves as manager of Trumps campaign committee declined to commentPage and Trump aides have said that Page never_met Trump and Page left the campaign in August 2016 Page has denied working on behalf of the Russians and said questions about his Moscow ties are part of a political witch_hunt designed by Democrats to discredit TrumpPage has for months declined to answer_questions about how he joined the Trump team and who invited him aboard calling the matter irrelevant in an email_exchange with The Washington PostIn a letter to Deputy_Attorney General_Rod J_Rosenstein last_week Page wrote that he had been an informal unpaid member of one of [Trumps] campaign committeesIn his defense Page in recent_weeks has sent a series of meandering letters to investigators He has quoted Maroon5 lyrics cited the writings of George Orwell and said he is being persecuted because of his Catholic faithIn a letter sent Wednesday to the House_Intelligence Committee Page referred to himself as an unpaid informal member of the Make America Great Again movement a reference to Trumps campaign slogan and said he had been illegitimately swept up into this investigation based on false evidence and propagandaPages entry to the campaign came as Trump was starting to win Republican primaries and take commanding leads in GOP polls but was also facing criticism for his lack of foreign_policy advisersIn early March_2016 more_than 70 conservative national_security experts signed an open letter opposing Trumps candidacy calling him fundamentally dishonest Trump announced that then-Sen Jeff_Sessions (R-Ala) the only senator supporting him would chair a foreign_policy panel for the campaign but no other members of the panel were named publiclyWhen the hosts of MSNBCs Morning Joe pressed Trump on air in mid-March to name people with whom he spoke about foreign affairs the candidates response only seemed to underscore his lack of serious adviceIm speaking with myself number one because I have a very good brain he saidAs the campaign maneuvered behind the scenes to expand its ranks Page had at_least one built-in advantage when he joined the Trump campaign geographic proximityHe ran a company Global Energy Capital LLC with offices located a block from Trump_Tower and connected by an atrium to the famed propertySome campaign veterans speculated that Page may have stepped forward on his own essentially walking into campaign headquarters and introducing himself without a referral a frequent occurrence at Trump_Tower in those early daysLast week Page rejected this version of events Wrong again he told The_Post via text message At least one other primary person(s) involvedOn Thursday after Cox described his role Page confirmed that the New_York GOP chairman had connected him to the Trump campaignCox said in an_interview that Page an acquaintance from business and political circles had reached out to him in early 2016 expressing interest in joining the Trump campaign Cox said he routinely connected potential volunteers with GOP campaigns He described Page as very informed and up to date on thingsSeveral former officials recall that when Page first showed up at Trump_Tower Lewandowski introduced him to other campaign aides Lewandowski said he could not remember the encounter which was first reported by the Daily Caller but also did_not rule it outClovis who assembled and vetted the list of national_security advisers that included Page declined to comment Now a top official at the Agriculture Department Clovis had worked on Russia-related issues at the Pentagon in the 1980s and as a candidate for US Senate in Iowa in 2014 had questioned the effectiveness of sanctions_imposed after Russias incursion into UkraineRepresentatives for Flynn Sessions and Jared_Kushner Trumps senior adviser declined to comment A White_House official said senior policy_adviser Stephen Miller also a key campaign staffer at the time had no role in the formation of the foreign_policy groupA thorough vetting of Page might have revealed several red flags Page had spent three years working in Moscow for instance and he held stock in the Russian company Gazprom meaning that he could have a personal financial stake in the future of US-imposed sanctions against RussiaPage wrote in a September letter to then-FBI Director_James B_Comey that he had sold his de minimis equity investment in the Russian company at a loss a month earlierPage had previously drawn the attention of the FBI after he had conversations in 2013 with a man posing as an executive with the New_York branch of the Russian development bank Vnesheconombank The man was later convicted of being a Russian spy and FBI recordings included discussions among Russian operatives about their attempts to recruit Page Page has said that he cooperated with the FBI and that the only crime related to the incident is that US government officials appear to have recently revealed his role to the mediaBy late March_2016 when Trump appeared before The Posts editorial board he was prepared to brag about his new foreign_policy teamI can give you some of the names Trump said after Post Publisher Frederick J Ryan Jr asked about his advisersSecond on the list of five read aloud by Trump Carter_Page PhDAnother unusual name on Trumps list of foreign_policy experts was a little-known figure named George_Papadopoulos whose inclusion may also have demonstrated the vulnerabilities that came with limited vettingHes an energy consultant Trump said Excellent guyThe news media soon reported that Papadopoulos seemed to have exaggerated elements of his rsum And touting his position as a Trump adviser Papadopoulos began offering positive comments about Russian President_Vladimir Putin to foreign audiencesPapadopoulos did_not respond to requests for comment His name had surfaced four months earlier on a similar list of foreign_policy advisers circulated by the presidential campaign of Ben CarsonBarry Bennett who served as Carsons campaign_manager and later as an adviser to Trump recalled that he was surprised when Trump named Papadopoulos to his teamHe was someone who worked for me at the Carson campaign for like 15 minutes And somehow he was on the list Bennett said of his reaction to the Trump roster I was like how in the hell did that happenTrump soon added a few names to the group and held a formal briefing with its members in a conference room at his not-yet-opened hotel in Washington A photo of that session distributed by Trump on social_media meeting with my national_security team Trump wrote showed the candidate at the head of the table and Sessions at the opposite endPapadopoulos could be seen at the table Page was not there and Trump officials have said that Trump never_met Page during his five-month stint as an adviser People involved with the campaign recall that Page attended other meetings that the group held in Washington including one attended by Sessions He also submitted policy memos for the campaigns review a former campaign adviser saidIn June Page stunned a group of foreign_policy luminaries during a private meeting at Blair House with the visiting prime_minister of India by going off-topic to declare that Putin was a stronger and more reliable leader than President_Barack Obama according to people who were in the room Page also promised that US-Russian relations would improve if Trump were elected Page has denied this account blaming it on his political enemiesThe next month Page delivered a speech at a Russian university in which he was highly critical of US policy Page has said he met with no Russian_government officials during the trip except for briefly greeting a deputy prime_minister who attended the eventOver the summer the FBI convinced a Foreign_Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable_cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of Russia law_enforcement and other US officials Pages name also appeared in a now-famous dossier which quietly circulated among reporters and alleged that there were links_between Trump associates and the Kremlin The document asserted that Page met with top Russian officials to plot how to elect TrumpThe document which was compiled by a former_British spy employed by Trumps political adversaries became public after the election and was dismissed by Trump and his allies as fake_news Page vigorously rejects the allegation about him and said the FBI should spend its time investigating how the document came together instead of his activitiesPage used his Wednesday letter to the House_Intelligence Committee to defend his contacts with the Russians Presenting the letter as a follow-up to Brennans testimony Page wrote that throughout my interactions with the Russians in 2016 I consistently made it crystal clear that all of my benign statements and harmless actions in Moscow as well as elsewhere overseas were solely made as a scholar and a business person speaking only on behalf of myself In other_words in no way connected to then-candidate TrumpEarlier this month Page insisted in writing to the Senate_Intelligence Committee that for all the attention he has received he did_not once meet TrumpIn retrospect and with the 1984-inspired governance standards employed in 2016 Page wrote I consider it fortunate that I never briefed Mr Trump Devlin_Barrett and Alice_Crites contributed to this

residents of this fish-and-chips enclave in the land of flamenco pamper their simian neighbors with meticulous care and feedingYet even as the colony of apes tailless monkeys really thrives in its home at the top of the Rock the 30000 Britons who live at the foot of the soaring limestone monolith are feeling nervousThey may not be going anywhere But thanks to Brexit Gibraltar is about to leave the European_Union giving Spain new impetus in its centuries-long quest to retake control of this strategically vital and economically prosperous territory Britains sole continental outpostTo the residents who take their Britishness seriously Spains suggestions that Gibraltar could be cut_off from the rest of Europe unless it accepts at_least partial Spanish sovereignty represent a serious threatGibraltar they say embodies the European ideal of shared prosperity through cross-border trade and movement But as European bonds fray those living here worry that the coupling of Brexit with Spanish threats could return Gibraltar to a painful pastInstead of feeding the goose that lays the golden egg Spain is trying to kill it said Ernest Tito Vallejo Smith a retired military man local historian and tour guide We dont_know whats_going to happen Were stuck in limboIn that respect Gibraltar has company Since to exit the EU the country has been locked in suspended animation awaiting the outcome of negotiations that will reshape virtually every aspect of its relationship with its European neighborsAs Gibraltars predicament shows untangling Britain from the EU will not be easy With the negotiations expected to begin this spring British Prime_Minister Theresa May has vowed that she will deliver results to a population demanding liberation from the Brussels bureaucracy and in particular greater freedom to limit migration into BritainBut she also will have to defend British financial interests which are heavily intertwined with the EU And she will need to look out for each of the United Kingdoms component parts some of which Scotland Northern Ireland and Gibraltar voted against BrexitMeanwhile European negotiators will seek to use every bit of leverage to drive a hard bargain with their soon-to-be-former EU ally and to dissuade other wavering members from a rush to the exitsThe negotiations due to last two years could leave tiny Gibraltar especially vulnerable Its residents know this well and it helps to explain_why 96percent of Gibraltarians who voted in the June referendum opted for remainUnlike its rainy island motherland some 1000 miles to the north sun-splashed Gibraltar relies on daily movement and trade across a European border to supply nearly half of its workforce and the vast majority of its resources And the country that controls that border is Spain which gave Gibraltar away to Britain in a peace treaty more_than 300 years_ago and has wanted it back ever sinceWith the Brexit vote Spanish officials seemed to think their moment had finally come Within hours of the result then-Foreign Minister Jos Garca-Margallo declared that the time to plant the Spanish flag on the Rock was close at handLast fall Spain took its case to the United_Nations arguing that Britains hold on Gibraltar represented an outdated relic of colonialismSpains position has slightly softened in recent_weeks with the countrys new foreign_minister acknowledging that Spain has little hope of regaining control as long as the British government and Gibraltar authorities refuse to budge But he also suggested that there will be consequences to Gibraltarians for a spurned Spanish offer of co-sovereigntyThey have a right to get left out of the EU if thats what they want Alfonso Dasits told the Spanish newspaper El Pas But if Gibraltar wants a relationship with the EU it will have to go through usTo longtime residents the implication is so clear it doesnt even need to be stated With Britain and Gibraltar out of the EU Spain could decide to sharply limit movement at the border choking off the territorys thriving economy which is built on financial services online gambling and e-commerceMost people here do not think Spanish authorities actually would go that far But as residents know from bitter experience it has been done beforeNever underestimate the lengths that the Spanish government will go to to damage Gibraltar said Edward Macquisten chief_executive of the Gibraltar Chamber of Commerce Thats the lesson of our historyIndeed steady as the Rock of Gibraltar may be a familiar phrase worldwide but through millennia of war siege and disputed control this place has rarely been placidIts location on a peninsula jutting into the Mediterranean with clear views of the African and European coasts plus the nine-mile-wide strait that bears Gibraltars name has made it an incomparable military prize The Rock itself is a natural fortress its sheer walls deterring all but the most dogged invadersBut the same factors that made Gibraltar so coveted have also made it the object of damaging battles as the tunnels cannon batteries and pockmarked stone walls that litter the verdant Rock attestWith only one road in and out Gibraltar is also highly vulnerable to siege In 1969 the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco took advantage of that weakness abruptly closing the border The territory was cut_off from supplies and deprived of workers Families divided by the separation were forced to shout news of births and deaths across a fence their words dying in the sea wind on particularly blustery daysThe border was not fully reopened for 16 years creating a bitter and lasting memoryWe dont_want to go back to a situation of history revisiting itself said Jennifer Ballantine director of the Gibraltar Garrison Library It was painful enough the first timeChief Minister of Gibraltar Fabian Picardo insists that that is not going to happen and that neither is any form of Spanish sovereignty an idea Gibraltarians emphatically rejected in a 2002 referendumThe people of France are French the people of Germany are German and the people of Gibraltar are British Picardo said in an_interview in his handsome offices off Gibraltars Main Street which is lined with fruit-laden orange trees and red postal boxes bearing the seal of Queen Elizabeth IIBritains vote for Brexit Picardo said was a moment of deep sorrow in Gibraltar because residents are committed Europeans and because they knew the vote to leave would give Spain leverageBut now that Britain has made its choice he said it is vital for the territory to retain access to the single European market and to preserve fluid movement for the 12000 workers who cross the border daily He said Britains government will fight for bothI have absolutely no_doubt that London understands how important those issues are for Gibraltar and for the United Kingdom he saidBritish officials have for their part insisted that they will not submit to Spanish demands Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson made that clear in typically colorful fashion declaring that Britain would maintain an implacable marmoreal and rock-like resistance to any effort to weaken its control over GibraltarBut even so Gibraltars plucky residents are girding themselves for possible hard times The monkeys Europes only free-range colony are here to stay and so are the British But that doesnt_mean life wont become roughThe Gibraltarian is a born survivor Weve been through sieges through wars through all kinds of bad times said Vallejo Smith the tour guide historian and lifelong resident who at 68 speaks from personal experience But somehow we always manage to come out afloat Karla_Adam in London contributed to this reportWith the transatlantic relationship on the line European leaders are trying to put a brave face on Donald Trumps new world orderThey may hold the American president-elect in profound disdain a feeling many But through gritted teeth they insist that the ties anchoring the globe since World_War II will endure if not with much warmth then at_least through the sort of transactional relations Trump can understandThat theory however will be put to the test as tweets and interviews turn into policy and actionAfter decades of transatlantic relations based on a shared set of interests and values Europe is reckoning with what could happen if only one of those remainsIts where interests and values intersect where were going to find problems said Robin Niblett director of the London-based think_tank Chatham House If our values stand for anything its open democratic societies and open markets If America moves away from those thats pretty fundamentalTrump supporters would undoubtedly say he is fully committed to democracy and capitalism But many Europeans view in his tweets and raucous rallies a fundamental shake-up of the values underpinning the liberal international orderAnalysts and former European officials say the list of potential flash points includes Russia Iran Israel and Palestine climate_change democracy promotion and global tradeTo European leaders the gap goes beyond mere policy differencesThe president-elects determination to embrace adversarial autocrats such as Russian President_Vladimir Putin even as he pointedly criticizes allied democrats such as German Chancellor_Angela Merkel his threats to discard internationally agreed deals such as the Paris climate accord or the Iranian nuclear agreement his indifference to the fate of the European_Union and dismissive approach toward NATO his apparent lack of concern about evidence of Russian_interference in the US election and his oft-repeated jabs at free_trade and the media all point to an Atlantic-size gulf between the new US commander in chief and the European establishment Serious tensions have erupted between Europe and Washington before think the freedom fries era when France and Germany rejected the Bush administrations march to war in Iraq But rarely have Europeans felt that fundamental values may be so deeply in oppositionWere getting into uncharted territory here where Europeans will have to strike a balance between a transatlantic relationship that remains intense and a deep fundamental disagreement on values and an interpretation of what democracy is about said Stefano Stefanini a former senior Italian diplomat who was his nations ambassador to NATO from 2007 to 2010It is difficult to know to what extent Trump will carry through on his foreign_policy promises In confirmation hearings his cabinet nominees have at times with the man who selected them Analysts also note that Trumps promises are often contradictoryBut European nerves were this week when Trump told interviewers from a British and a German newspaper that he thought more countries would follow Britain out of the EU that NATO was obsolete and that Merkel had made a catastrophic mistake by welcoming hundreds of thousands of refugeesThe sudden unpredictability of Europes most_important global partner comes as the continent is deep in the throes of its own identity crisis reeling from the same populist shocks that brought Trump to power the fall of Italys center-left prime_minister and the emergence of in Eastern Europe are all considered symptoms of the anti-establishment tide washing over the Western worldYet unlike in Washington as of Friday the establishment remains in charge in most European capitalsBut no one knows for how longWith elections looming this year in the Netherlands France and Germany far-right parties are making a concerted push to end the centrist consensus that has prevailed in Western Europe for generations That dynamic coupled with Trumps unpredictability makes it almost impossible to say what contours the US-European relationship will take Theres absolutely huge uncertainty over what kind of US administration Europe will find itself dealing with said Adam Thomson director of the European Leadership Network and a former_British ambassador to NATO Theres also uncertainty for the Trump administration over what kind of Europe America will be dealing with For the most part European leaders have tried to project confidence that the Trump era will be business as usual with shared interests in combating terrorism tamping crises and promoting economic_growth overriding any differencesBritain with one foot out the door of the EU has been particularly keen to cultivate close ties and ensure its special relationship with Washington remains intactEuropes accommodating response reflects how internally divided it has become and how little power it has relative to Washington The United_States spends vastly more on defense than Europe nearly three_times as much as all European members of NATO combinedTrump has demanded that NATO_allies pay their own way while raising questions about whether he would come to members defense in the event of an attack His closest European ally is neither British prime_minister Theresa May nor Merkel but the bomb-throwing Brexit champion who wants Britains departure to be the trigger event in the EUs ultimate collapseThere has never been an American president who did_not support European integration Its a first A tragedy for Europe Stefanini saidDespite European division and weakness leaders could be left with little choice but to distance themselves from Trump if he follows through on pledges considered antithetical to European valuesA ban on Muslim immigration a resumption of the use of torture or an end to American participation in the Paris climate accord all Trump campaign promises would undoubtedly elicit strongly negative reactions in EuropeBut perhaps most critical will be his handling of two of the Wests adversaries Russia and IranTrump appears determined to improve ties with Putin just three years after Russian military intervention in Ukraine prompted the United_States and Europe to impose sanctionsIn theory much of Europe would welcome a lowering of tensions between Russia and the West said Thomson the former_British ambassador But the details will be criticalIts important for Europeans that this is not seen as some kind of sellout to Russia and that theres not a US-Russia deal done over European heads Thomson said On Iran too the maneuvering will be extremely delicate Trump has repeatedly attacked as a really really bad deal the negotiated in 2015 between Iran and six of the worlds leading powers the United_States the United Kingdom France Germany Russia and China Any Trump move to unilaterally pull the United_States out risks antagonizing every other party to the agreement Critics say it could also undermine global faith in Washingtons commitment to live up to its promises If Europe is going to effectively counter Trump however it will have to stay united And it is far from clear that it can The declaration was a signal not only to Trump but to her own voters ahead of an election in which she faces the likelihood of a far-right anti-immigrant party capturing seats in the Parliament for the first timeA lot of thinking in Berlin is already going into how we will have to reckon with Trump in actions he takes strategically or actions he takes that impact the Western liberal order said Daniela Schwarzer head of the German Council on Foreign RelationsBut there are limits to how far Germany can goEven if Germany is willing to take the lead it needs to work with others And this is a messy picture Schwarzer saidWith Britain focused on its EU exit London is unlikely to take a stand against Trump unless it is forced to do so Europes other major power France has its own struggles as it prepares for spring presidential elections in which a far-right party stands a chance of victoryWhoever wins French policy analysts said they feared their country was entering a new era of ties with WashingtonIn many ways its not so much what America will do but in a way what America has become said Dominique Moisi a co-founder of the French Institute for International Relations Its essence as much as its performance We dont_know what the performance is going to be but we have an inkling that the essence of America has changed Birnbaum reported from Brussels and McAuley from ParisRobert S_Mueller III was greeted with near universal praise when he was appointed to lead the investigation_into possible_coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election but as he builds his special_counsel team his every hire is under scrutinyAt least seven of the 15 lawyers Mueller has brought on to the special_counsel team have donated to Democratic political candidates five of them to Hillary_Clinton a fact that President Trump and his allies have eagerly highlighted These critics also point to some of the lawyers history working with clients connected to the Clintons and Muellers long history with former FBI_director as they question whether those assigned to the investigation can be impartialMany lawyers and ethics_experts say they can see no significant legal or ethical concerns with the teams political giving or past work and they note that Trump often misstates the facts as he casts aspersions But others say the optical problem is a real one that threatens to undermine public confidence in the probe In my view prosecutors who make political_contributions are identifying fairly strongly with a political party said William P Barr who served as attorney_general under George_HW Bush I would have liked to see him have more balance on this groupCriticizing those conducting an investigation is not a new tactic Democrats famously in the crosshairs during his examination of President Bill_Clinton And by raising questions about the investigators early legal_analysts said Trump is laying the groundwork to question any results that are not to his likingBy staking out the position of partisanship through campaign contributions the president simply is setting a stage for a public relations assault down the road said Jacob Frenkel a defense lawyer at Dickinson Wright who previously worked in the now-defunct Office of the Independent CounselTrump hascalled the special_counsels investigation the single greatest in American political history adding that it was led by some very bad and conflicted people In a more recent the president said that Mueller was very very good friends with Comey which is very bothersome and that the people that have been hired are all Hillary_Clinton supporters some of them worked for Hillary ClintonI mean the whole thing is ridiculous if you want to know the truth from that standpoint Trump said But Robert Muellers an honorable man and hopefully hell come up with an honorable solutionAsked if Mueller would have to recuse_himself he said Were_going to have to seeTrump supporters have raised similar concerns Former Republican House speaker Newt_Gingrich that Republicans were delusional if they think the special_counsel is going to be fair The pro-Trump group Great America Alliance in which conservative commentator Tomi Lahren opined Only in Washington could a rigged game like this be called independentBut Attorney_General a strong Trump backer who has recused himself from the Russia probe was more circumspect on FridayMr Mueller is entitled lawfully I_guess at this point to hire who he desires but I_think he should look for people who have strength and credibility by all people Sessions saidPressed on whether he had confidence in Mueller Sessions said I feel confident in what hell do Thats all I can say to you about thatMueller has brought in 15 attorneys to work with him among them former colleagues at the firm WilmerHale and veteran Justice_Department lawyers said Peter Carr a spokesman for the Special_Counsels Office Only 13 have been publicly identifiedPut together the team is a formidable collection of legal talent and expertise with experience prosecuting national_security fraud and public corruption cases arguing matters before the Supreme_Court and assessing complicated legal questionsThe team members include a Justice_Department deputy solicitor general who has argued more_than 100 cases before the Supreme_Court the chief of the Justice_Departments fraud section who worked as an assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force and a former deputy assistant attorney_general in the Office of Legal Counsel who also came from WilmerHaleRhee was on the team representing the Clinton_Foundation and another lawyer working with the special_counsel once represented Clinton aide Justin Cooper Zebley was Muellers chief of staff when Mueller served as FBI directorCarr confirmed to The Washington_Post that a Justice_Department national_security division prosecutor a trial attorney in the fraud section and who had headed the public corruption unit in the US Attorneys Office in the Southern_District of New_York and an assistant US attorney in the Eastern District of New_York specializing in terrorism cases also had been assigned to work with the group Goldstein had worked in the office under US Attorney Preet Bharara who was fired by Trump after he refused to resign upon request and Ahmad was recently profiled by the New_Yorker for having prosecuted 13 terrorism cases without a single lossSeven special_counsel team members have donated to Democratic campaigns five of those to Clintons and their giving totals nearly $53000 The other six that are publicly known to be on the team did_not give any political_contributions records showEthics experts said the giving should not preclude anyones participation Justice_Department policies and federal law actually when it comes to hiring for nonpolitical positions meaning Mueller might feel he cannot consider donation history when he makes hiresBottom line is I dont see how donations are relevant said Richard Painter who was the ethics lawyer for President George_W Bush Ive never heard of a single case where a prosecutor has been removed because of a political donation Quarless donations were the most substantial Over two_decades he gave more_than $30000 to various Democratic campaigns including $2700 to Clintons in 2016 But Quarles has also given to Republicans contributing $2500 in 2015 to Rep Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) chairman of the House Oversight Committee and $250 to then-Sen George Allen (R-Va) in 2005Rhee donated nearly $12000 to various Democratic campaigns including President_Barack Obamas and Clintons and Weissmann donated at_least $6600 Goldstein donated $3300 to Obamas campaigns Three others Van Grack Atkinson and in the Solicitor Generals office donated less_than $1000 between themSome experts said Trumps assertions provide no real basis to question the teams workTheres a bipartisan consensus that the various wild conflicts allegations that have been made by Trump and his allies are groundless said Norm Eisen a fellow at the Brookings Institution who served as Obamas ethics czar It just is not the case that lawyers or investigators are disqualified by political activity of this kindTrump and his allies have also fixated on the longtime professional relationship between Mueller and Comey but the president might be overstating their relationshipThe two_men played central roles in a 2004 incident during the George_W Bush administration that has entered Washington lore when both prepared to resign instead of go along with the reauthorization of a controversial surveillance program The episode became particularly famous for Comeys intervention at the hospital bed of then-Attorney General John AshcroftComey could be a key figure in Muellers investigation The special_counsels probe includes a look at whether Trump attempted to in possibly trying to shut_down the investigation of former national_security adviser_Michael Flynn Comeys_firing might be considered a piece of evidence in that caseEthics experts said they see no reason Mueller who is registered as a Republican would have a conflict And David N Kelley Comeys attorney disputed Trumps characterization of his client and Muellers connectionBob and Jim have a congenial relationship as former colleagues Both served long legal careers that involved overlapping time spent within the Department of Justice and thats pretty well documented But beyond that theyre not close personal friends Kelley said Theyre friends in the sense that co-workers are friends They dont really have a personal relationshipKelley said Comey had never been to Muellers home and Mueller had never been to Comeys home He said they had lunch together once and dinner together twice once with their spouses and once after Comey became FBI_director so Mueller could brief him on the job Once in 2004 with two others from the Justice_Department they played golf together Kelley saidKelley said Deputy_Attorney General knew of Mueller and Comeys relationship before naming Mueller as the special_counsel Rosenstein himself was appointed by TrumpI dont_think Jim has given it a lot of thought but why would Bob be conflicted Kelley said Bobs not conducting an investigation where Jim is pitted against a target of the investigation If anything hes a witnessMueller also has professional connections and some of those are allied with TrumpAlthough he resigned to take the special_counsel job Mueller had worked for the law_firm WilmerHale whose lawyers represent Trumps former campaign_chairman Trumps daughter_Ivanka and the presidents son-in-law Justice_Department ethics_experts ultimately despite that and Carr said they gave the same consideration and approval to others from his firmOn the day of North_Koreas first atomic test in 2006 aides to President George_W Bush began phoning foreign capitals to reassure allies startled by Pyongyangs surprising feat The test aides said had been mostly a failure a botched 1-kiloton cry for attention from a regime that had no warheads or reliable delivery systems and would never be allowed to obtain themThe current course that they are on is unacceptable State_Department spokesman Sean McCormack said publicly at the time and the international_community is going to actA decade later that confidence has all but evaporated After a week in which Pyongyang successfully lobbed into the Sea of Japan US officials are no_longer seeing North_Koreas weapons tests as amateurish attention-grabbing provocations Instead they are viewed as evidence of a rapidly growing threat and one that increasingly defies solutionOver the past_year technological advances in North_Koreas nuclear and missile_programs have dramatically raised the stakes in the years-long standoff between the United_States and the reclusive communist regime according to current and former US officials and Korea experts Pyongyangs growing arsenal has rattled key US allies and spurred efforts by all sides to develop new first-strike capabilities increasing the risk that a simple mistake could trigger a devastating regional war the analysts saidThe military developments are coming at a time of unusual political ferment with a new and largely untested administration in Washington and with South_Koreas government coping with an Longtime observers say the risk of conflict is higher than it has been in years and it is likely to rise further as North_Korean leader_Kim Jong_Un seeks to fulfill his pledge to field long-range missiles capable of striking US citiesThis is no_longer about a lonely dictator crying for attention or demanding negotiations said Victor Cha a former adviser on North_Korea to the Bush administration and the Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International_Studies a Washington think_tank This is now a military testing program to acquire a proven capability Pyongyangs ambition to become an advanced nuclear-armed state is not new North_Korea began building its first reactor for making plutonium more_than three decades ago Over the years it has shown ingenuity in increasing the range and power of a stockpile of homemade short- and medium-range missiles all based on Soviet-era designsOften in the past the new innovations have been accompanied by demands a clamoring for security guarantees and international respect by a paranoid and nearly friendless government that perceives its democratic neighbors as plotting its destruction After the first atomic test in 2006 then-leader Kim_Jong Il threatened to launch nuclear missiles unless Washington agreed to face-to-face talksNorth Korea has been slammed instead with ever-tighter meant to cut_off access to technology and foreign cash flows Yet despite the trade restrictions diplomatic isolation threats and occasional sabotage the countrys weapons_programs have continued their upward march goaded forward by dictators willing to sacrifice their citizens well-being to grow the countrys military mightAnd now in the progress is coming in leapsPyongyangs occurred on Sept9 on the 68th anniversary of North_Koreas founding Seismic monitoring stations picked_up vibrations from the underground blast and quickly determined that this one was exceptionalScientific analyses of the test determined that the new bombs explosive yield approached 30kilotons two times the force of the Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima Japan in 1945 The device was twice as powerful as the bomb North_Korea tested just nine months earlier and it was 30times stronger than one detonated in 2006 in a remote mountain tunnel More ominously North_Korea last March displayed a new compact bomb one that appears small enough to fit inside the nose cone of one of its indigenously produced missilesRegardless of whether the miniature bomb is real or a clever prop North_Korea does finally appear to be on the verge of a nuclear breakout said Robert Litwak an expert on nuclear proliferation and director of International Security Studies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars He said Pyongyangs arsenal is believed to now contain as many as 20 nuclear bombs along with enough plutonium and highly enriched uranium to make dozens moreWhen I got into this field Litwak said at a symposium on North_Korea this month I couldnt have conceived of North_Korea acquiring a nuclear arsenal approaching half the size of Great BritainsThe countrys missiles also have grown more sophisticated Last year North_Koreas military conducted the first test of a a significant advance over the countrys existing liquid-fueled rockets because they can be moved easily and launched quickly Also in 2016 North_Korea broadcast images of engineers testing engines for a new class of advanced missiles with true intercontinental range potentially putting cities on the US mainland within reachThe provocations have continued in the weeks since the inauguration of President Trump who just before taking office appeared to taunt Pyongyang in a Twitter post saying that North_Koreas plan for building intercontinental_ballistic missiles A month later Kim launched one of the countrys new solid-fuel missiles interrupting with visiting Japanese_Prime Minister_Shinzo Abe Last weeks coordinated launch of four intermediate-range missiles appeared intended to showcase the countrys ability to fire multiple rockets simultaneously at US military bases in Japan increasing the likelihood that some will penetrate antimissile shieldsNorth Koreas state-run media has occasionally shown propaganda footage of Kim huddling with his generals over what some analysts have jokingly called the map of death a chart that portrays Japanese and US mainland cities as potential targetsThe laughter has now stopped said Jeffrey_Lewis an expert on North_Korean weapons systems This idea that these things were just bargaining chips something that was true years_ago is superseded by the fact that there is now a rocket force with a commander and a headquarters and subordinate bases all with missiles said Lewis director of the East_Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation_Studies This is now a living breathing thingThere have been notable failures as well Numerous test rockets have drifted far off course and others never made it off the launchpad Many analysts say it could still be several years before Kim can construct a true ICBM that could reliably reach the US mainland and perhaps longer before he can demonstrate an ability to incorporate a nuclear payload into his rocket design Yet already the basic components for a future arsenal of long-range nuclear-tipped missiles are in place Lewis saidThe ICBM program is real Lewis said Theyve showed us their static engine test They showed us the mock-up of the nuclear_warhead They have done everything short of actually testing the ICBM When they do test it the first time it will probably fail But eventually it will work And when it works people are going to freak outFor decades the United_States and its East Asian allies have tried an array of strategies to blunt North_Koreas progress ranging from diplomacy to covert operations to defensive antimissile shields Lately the search for solutions has taken on an intensity not seen in yearsAs diplomatic initiatives have stalled US Japanese and South_Korean officials have broadened the search for measures to ensure that Pyongyangs missiles remain grounded or in the event of a launch can be brought down before they reach their target The efforts have proved to be partly successful at bestThree years_ago alarmed by North_Koreas advances on missile systems the Obama_administration ordered the Pentagon and intelligence_agencies to deploy highly classified cyber and electronic measures against North_Korea largely aimed_at undermining the countrys nuclear and missile_programs two former senior administration officials said Aspects of the initiatives were described in The effort was further intensified last_year the officials said in response to new intelligence assessments showing North_Korea inching closer to its goal of fielding long-range ballistic_missiles The clandestine effort begun under President_Barack Obama appears to have borne fruit judging from a rash of missile failures in the past_year said one former official familiar_with the program The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the secret operationsWere stopping shipments Were making sure things dont work the way theyre supposed to one former official said Weve been able to delay things in some cases probably by a lot Its a cat-and-mouse gameBut the second official familiar_with the Pentagons cyberwarfare efforts acknowledged that North_Korea remains an exceptionally difficult target because of its isolation and limited digital infrastructure The official suggested that at_least some of the recent missile failures were probably caused by North_Korean errors I would be wary of claiming too_much he saidWe were trying to use all the tools that were available to us in order to degrade as much of their capabilities as possible a second former official said But we just did_not have nearly as much game as we should haveIn handoff meetings with Trump Obama described the gathering threat in stark terms calling it the most serious proliferation challenge facing the new administration according to aides familiar_with the discussions The Trump White_House has since convened three deputies committee meetings on North_Korea and ordered a new top-to-bottom threat assessment White_House officials say that Trump is weighing all options from a new diplomatic initiative to enhanced military capabilities possibly including a highly controversial return of tactical nuclear_weapons to South_Korea for the first time since the early 1990sThe administration is dispatching Secretary of State_Rex Tillerson to East_Asia this week to confer with counterparts in Beijing Tokyo and Seoul And the White_House is defending its decision last_week to send antimissile batteries to South_Korea despite vehement opposition from ChinaThe initiatives have failed to calm tensions in the region As more missiles streak across North_Koreas eastern coast Japanese and South_Korean officials are pledging increased investments in defensive shields and highly accurate conventionally armed missiles designed to preemptively destroy North_Korean launch sites and command centers if an attack seems imminent North_Korea has responded with similar threats describing its recent missile_launches as a dry run for a preemptive the presumed staging ground for forces preparing to come to South_Koreas aid if war breaks outIn the past such a strike would be seen as suicidal as it would certainly result in a devastating counterattack against North_Korea that would probably destroy the regime itself But Kim is betting that an arsenal of long-range nuclear-tipped missiles would serve as an effective deterrent said Cha the former Bush administration adviserThats why they want to be able to reach the continental United_States so they can effectively hold us hostage Cha said Do we really want to trade Los Angeles for whatever city in North KoreaSuch an attack on the US mainland is not yet within North_Koreas grasp and US officials hope they can eventually neutralize the threat with improvements in antimissile systems But in the meantime each new advance increases the chance that a small mishap could rapidly escalate into all-out war Cha said In a crisis everyone is put in a use-it-or-lose-it situation in which everyone feels he has to go first he saidThe growing danger now he said is miscalculation Ellen_Nakashima contributed to this reportTensions between Republicans and Democrats over the investigation of Russian involvement in the 2016_presidential election intensified Sunday with President Trump demanding to know why his campaign is under federal scrutiny while his former opponent_Hillary Clinton is not The presidents latest outburst over the inquiry led by special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III surfaced on Twitter as his administration braced for the possibility that the first batch of charges in the case could be publicly announced as soon as Monday that a federal grand_jury had approved an indictment although details of the possible charges and the name of a defendant remained unclearTrump issued four tweets over 24 minutes attacking the Mueller probe as unfair and citing various Clinton controversies that he said warranted investigation Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia collusion which doesnt exist the president said The Dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) Witch Hunt for evil politics but the Rs are now fighting back like never before There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton and now the facts are pouring out DO SOMETHINGLater in the morning Trump added All of this Russia talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts & Reform Is this coincidental NOTOn Sunday talk shows Republicans rallied around Trump and questioned how CNN could have received information about secret grand_jury proceedingsThere are very very strict laws on grand_jury secrecy so depending on who leaked this to CNN thats a criminal violation potentially New_Jersey Gov Chris Christie (R) a longtime friend of Trumps said on CNNs State of the Union on Sunday For us to have confidence in this process weve got to make_sure that the grand_jury process remains confidential remains secret so that the special_counsel can work effectively to be able to get to the bottom of all that hes looking intoHouse Majority_Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif) cast doubt on the objectivity of Muellers_team noting that the prosecutors staff includes a lot of individuals attorneys who played in politics whove given money on the Democratic side Of the eight attorneys on the team who have been publicly identified including President_Barack Obama and Clinton This president won the election solely on the idea that he connected with the American people No other influence involved McCarthy said on Foxs Sunday Morning Futures But the idea of what Ive watched of what the Democrats have been doing it sure raises a lot of questionsRep Trey Gowdy (R-SC) chairman of the House Oversight Committee came to Muellers defense and said that he doesnt agree with Republicans who are calling for Mueller to resign or stop his investigation I would encourage my Republican friends give the guy a chance to do his job Gowdy said on Fox_News Sunday The result will be known by the facts by what he uncovers I would say give the guy a chance to do his jobDemocratic lawmakers mostly stayed out of the Sunday fray after a week in which Clintons 2016 campaign came under fresh scrutiny The campaign funded political opposition_research into Trump that helped create a highly publicized dossier on the Republican candidate and fueled some allegations now under_scrutiny by MuellerThe 35-page dossier is composed of 17 memos containing raw intelligence some of it highly salacious and not independently confirmed It relies on Kremlin-linked sources and alleges that the Russian_government had been trying to support Trumps candidacy while gathering compromising_information that could be used as blackmail The dossier was published by BuzzFeed in January Its unclear how_much the Clinton campaign and Democratic_National Committee paid for the opposition_research by Fusion_GPS a Washington firm that conducts investigations for private clients The Clinton campaign paid $56million in legal fees to a law_firm from June 2015 to December 2016 according to campaign finance records and the DNC paid the firm $36 million in legal and compliance consulting since November 2015 Its impossible to tell from the filings how_much of that work was for other legal matters and how_much of it related to Fusion GPSTrump tweeted Sunday morning that the dossier which he called Clinton made Fake Dossier could have cost as much as $12 million although he did_not explain how he reached that number Trump was at it again early Monday In a tweet Trump again cited funding reports without elaborating on a source Report out that Obama Campaign paid $972000 to Fusion_GPS Trump wrote The firm also got $12400000 (really) from DNC Nobody knows who OKdCompiled by former_British intelligence agent Christopher_Steele the dossier mirrors a separate conclusion reached by US intelligence_agencies that the Russian_government intervened in the US election in an effort to bolster Trump and harm Clinton such as through hacking the DNC and distributing materials to WikiLeaks to publish at key momentsFusion GPS which hired Steele to gather information was first employed to investigate Trump during the Republican primaries by the a conservative publication that receives financial support from billionaire GOP_donor Paul Singer according to two people_familiar with Singer The Beacon said in a statement that its research ended before Fusion_GPS hired Steele and that none of the research that it commissioned is included in the dossier In April_2016 an and the DNC hired Fusion_GPS which then hired Steele Brian_Fallon a former spokesman for the Clinton campaign said he learned about Steele and the dossier after the election People familiar_with the matter told The Washington_Post that the Clinton campaign and the DNC did_not direct Steeles activitiesRep Adam_B Schiff_(Calif) the ranking_Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence said Sunday that a lot of the information in the dossier has been corroborated I certainly would have liked to know who paid for it earlier but nonetheless thats just one factor to be considered Schiff said on ABCs This Week on Sunday It doesnt answer the ultimate question which is How much of the work is accurate How much of it is true And my colleagues dont seem particularly interested in that question but that is really the most_important question for the American peopleSchiff said he has not been told anything about any impending indictments in Muellers investigation noting that such notification would not have been appropriate Trump also tweeted Sunday about Clintons involvement in what he called the Uranium to Russia deal demanding that the matter receive greater scrutinyThe while Clinton was secretary of state allowed a Russian nuclear energy agency to acquire a controlling stake in a Canadian-based company that had mining licenses for about 20percent of US uranium_extraction capacity The company cannot export the uranium Earlier this month House and Senate Republican leaders announced they would and the House Oversight Committee launched a probe into during the campaign In the latter investigation Republicans say they want to know why then-FBI Director_James B_Comey publicly announced that the bureau was investigating Clinton but waited months before making a similar announcement about its inquiries into the Trump campaign Ed OKeefe Karoun Demirjian and Brian Murphy contributed to this reportBEIJING President-elect Donald Trump and North_Korean leader_Kim Jong_Un have been trading threats this week while China poses as the mature reasonable kid on the blockKim kicked things off in a New Years address Sunday by saying his country was close to test-launching an_intercontinental ballistic_missile (ICBM) which if successful could ultimately put a nuclear_warhead within range of parts of the United StatesTrump who had once suggested inviting Kim over for a hamburger to persuade him to give up his nuclear_weapons program took to his usual medium to respondNorth Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear_weapon capable of reaching parts of the US It wont_happen Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) But how experts asked did the US president-elect aim to stop it happeningThe head of the Brookings Institution offered one interpretationHas our next commander-in-chief issued 18 days before his Inaugration a pledge that the US will wage preemptive war against the DPRK Strobe Talbott (@strobetalbott) South_Korea not wanting perhaps to contemplate that possibility of rockets raining down on the Korean_Peninsula took a different view Its Foreign_Ministry said Trump in his tweet had issued a clear warning to North_Korea that showed his awareness of the urgency of the threat and that he will not waver from a policy of imposing sanctionsBecause of our active outreach President-elect Trump and US officials are clearly aware of the gravity and urgency of the North_Korean nuclear threat ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck told a briefing They are maintaining an unwavering stance on the need for sanctions on North_Korea and for close cooperation between South_Korea and the USThis also raises the issue of how_much interpretation should be required for the tweets of what will soon be the most_powerful man in the world Euan Graham director of the international security program atthe Lowy Institute in Sydney said the world was on the slippery slope of trying to interpret one mans not particularly coherent tweets But he added that the exchange has increased the chances that North_Korea could be the first crisis out of the box in the Trump presidency at_least in AsiaCertainly Trump does appear to be concerned about the issueCiting a senior US intelligence official that Trumps first and at that time only request for a special classified intelligence briefing was for one on North_Korea and its nuclear_weapons program Obama also reportedly made clear his concerns over the issue at his handover conversation with TrumpBut what is Trump going to do His next tweet offered a clue Get China to do moreChina has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the US in totally one-sided trade but wont help with North_Korea Nice Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Those comments did_not go down particularly well in Beijing which argued it had been long pushing for the denuclearization of the Korean_Peninsula and cast itself as the voice of reason and moderationChinas efforts in this regard are perfectly obvious Foreign_Ministry spokesman_Geng Shuang told a regular news_conference As a permanent member of the UN_Security Council we have proactively participated in relevant discussions on the North_Korean nuclear issue and have jointly passed several resolutions with other partiesThis shows Chinas responsible attitudeChinas nationalist Global_Times newspaper took the argument a stage further saying that Trump was pandering to irresponsible attitudes and stoking the anxieties of some Americans in his accusations against ChinaChinese foreign_policy experts say the United_States was wrong to blame their country arguing that the fundamental motivation for North_Korea formally known as the Democratic_Peoples Republic of Korea or DPRK to develop nuclear_weapons is American hostilityThe DPRK feels unsafe because the United_States wants to overthrow it said Cai Jian a professor of Korea studies at Fudan University in Shanghai Now the United_States blames China and believes China is irresponsible This is very ridiculousThe United_States has long insisted that North_Korea must disarm before talks can be held and has responded to the countrys nuclear and missile_tests by tightening sanctions The latest round was imposed by the UN_Security Council in November and supported by ChinaBut despite the sanctions data shows trade between China and North_Korea is still growing said GrahamKim has put North_Koreas nuclear_weapons policy at the center of his countrys national and security strategy China would like Pyongyang to abandon the program but is unwilling to do anything that might destabilize the regime Western experts sayFrustration with China over the issue is something Trump shares with all of his immediate predecessors Graham said but the president-elects generally hard line toward Beijing would only make it dig in its heels more firmly he saidMeanwhile Trumps brash style has been something of a propaganda gift for BeijingTheres a funny sort of inversion game going on there Graham said China is trying to posture as the global stakeholder and the reliable party for regional peace and global governance whereas the United_States is in Chinas eyes reeling around like a punch-drunk heavyweightThe threat of an American missile_defense system being stationed in South_Korea appears to have concentrated minds in Beijing on how to punish PyongyangChina now seems ready to support limited United_Nations sanctions against North_Korea over a recent nuclear_test and rocket launches partly in response to US pressure experts said MondayBeijing has reacted angrily to the prospect of the Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defense_(THAAD) system being deployed in South_Korea but a tougher line from Washington and Seoul seems to be having some effect on Beijings calculations experts said on Monday China Daily argued that the missile_defense system was not the answer to the North_Korean crisisThere will be no ground for its introduction should the parties agree to a sanctions package that is sufficient for Pyongyang to reevaluate its nuclear_program the editorial said For that to happen the new UN resolution must truly bite The editorial echoes comments by Foreign_Minister Wang Yi who in Munich on Friday that the United_Nations should adopt a resolution to ensure North_Korea will pay the necessary price and to show there is a consequence for its behaviorChina of course would never admit it was reacting to American pressure It still favors much weaker sanctions than those proposed by the United_States and is likely locked in negotiations to soften the blow according to Yanmei Xie a senior China analyst at the International Crisis Group in BeijingIt could even be argued that Beijing is merely hyping the likely effect of a limited sanctions package to convince Seoul that the anti-missile system deployment is unnecessary and to cast Washington as the real troublemakerStill even nationalist tabloid Monday that China should shift policy toward North_Korea in the face of mounting pressure and growing challengesIt argued that elite and public opinion was changing with greater numbers of people now seeing North_Korea as a burden and an annoying neighbor rather_than an old friend This in turn led to a shift in favor of actions that make Pyongyang feel pain for its obduracyThe more Chinas policy in this regard departs from public opinion the more political cost China has to pay the Global_Times wroteAfter North_Korea launched a rocket this month apparently to test its ballistic_missile technology Seoul agreed to begin talks with Washington on deploying a THAAD unit with the US military in South KoreaTHAAD is a land-based system designed to shoot down incoming short- medium- and intermediate-range missiles and could offer South_Korea and some of the 25000 US troops deployed there greater protection against missiles launched from the NorthThe threat of deployment comes amid growing frustration in both Seoul and Washington not only with Pyongyangs actions but also with Chinas muted response But some Chinese experts argue the THAAD_system is mainly used for intercepting long-range missiles rather_than short-range ones and that its real target is China They argue that the proposal has undermined Beijings friendship with Seoul and widened distrust with the United StatesForeign Ministry_spokesman Hong Lei said Monday that the missile_defense system would directly violate Chinas strategic security interests and he condemned relevant countries for using the Korea peninsula issue to undermine those interestsThere is still a huge gulf separating China and the United_States in terms of their strategic goals over the North_Korea issue said Shi Yinhong director of the Center for American Studies at Renmin University of China in BeijingHe said China was willing to speed up US Security_Council negotiations but would not agree to any sanctions that covered its own trade with North_Korea or affected its neighbors access to food or oilAny sanctions he said would be less tough than measures China itself adopted in 2013 shortly_after President_Xi Jinping took power and at a time when relations with Washington were on an upswingNow it is impossible for China to do the same thing given the state of Sino-US_relations he said Also if China sanctions North_Korea like it did in 2013 North_Korea will become more of an enemyThe Crisis Groups Xie said China probably aims to do just enough in terms of sanctions to placate the South_Korean government and convince Seoul to again drag its feet over the THAAD_deployment as it has done for yearsChina may agree to narrow sanctions targeting certain individuals and entities but not those that could remotely threaten to destabilize the country or regime or turn North_Korea into an openly hostile neighbor she saidSanctions of that nature might dial up the pressure on the North_Korean regime a notch but are very unlikely to persuade it to abandon a nuclear_program that has become a cornerstone of the regimes national_security calculations experts saidDays after being sworn in President Trump insisted to congressional leaders invited to a reception at the White_House that he would have won the popular_vote had it not been for millions of illegal votes according to people_familiar with the meetingTrump has repeatedly claimed without evidence that widespread voter_fraud caused him to lose the popular_vote to Hillary_Clinton even while he clinched the presidency with an electoral college victoryTwo peoplefamiliar with the meeting said Trump spent about 10 minutes at the start of the bipartisan gathering rehashing the campaign He also told them that between 3 million and 5 million illegal votes caused him to lose the popular voteThe discussion about Trumps election victory andhis claim that he would have won the popular_vote was confirmed by a thirdperson familiar_with the meetingThe claim is and found virtually no confirmed cases of voter_fraud let alone millionsClinton won the popular_vote by more_than 28 million votes Trump won 304 electoral college votes to Clintons 227 House Majority_Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif) alluded to Trumps comments as he returned to the Capitol from the meeting Monday nightWe talked about different electoral college popular votes going through the different ones McCarthy said Well we talked about going back through past elections Everyone in there goes through elections and stuff so everybodys giving their different histories of different partsAsked by reporters after the meeting if Trump made any surprising statements at the gathering House Minority Leader Nancy_Pelosi (D-Calif) replied Well I wont even go into thatJia Yongtang doesnt have much luck with the ladies He thinks its because of all the weight hes put on More likely its because his online dating picture shows him as the spitting image of Kim_Jong UnThe North_Korean leader might be one of the most reviled people in the world but Jia has reason to be happy about the notoriety that comes with Pyongyangs endless missile_launches and occasional nuclear_tests For the past four years Jia has been making a living of sorts trading on his uncanny resemblance to the young dictatorSome people are excited some people are scared said Jia wearing sunglasses and a navy-blue Mao suit with a plastic version of the red Kim badge that all North_Koreans must wear over their hearts on the street in Taiyuan the capital of coal-producing Shanxi province I get a lot of requests for selfies Two young women stopped and gasped when they saw Kim getting into a black Mercedes-Benz SUV with a reporter They stopped and whispered to each_other trying to figure out if it really was Kim But no requests for selfiesAs the worlds attention turns to Beijing to see if it will punish Kim for his the case of Jia is something of a metaphor for the complicated relations between China and North KoreaChinas view of North_Korea is very different from that of the United_States Sure Beijing doesnt appreciate Kims efforts to develop deliverable nuclear_weapons and there are signs of a slight chill on the border between the two countries but China is not trying to bring about regime change or much change at allFurthermore theres a kind of nostalgia here among older people in particular for the simpler communist life the good old days before cutthroat capitalism arrived in China Jia whos about 5 foot 3 was working as a security guard in 2012 outside the Birds Nest one of the stadiums built for the Beijing Olympics when someone commented on his resemblance to Kim who had become the third-generation leader of North_Korea a few months beforeHe decided to take_advantage of the likeness but becoming a more obvious Kim_Jong Un took some work For starters Jia weighed only 130 pounds when he decided to morph into the North_Korean leader but with some concerted fried-rice consumption hes managed to get to 190 pounds (about 10 pounds lighter than the Internet estimates the real Kim weighs)He grew out his bangs and now has a Kim coif so perfect that some people think its a wigHe appears in character at random events and even has a brief scene at the end of a new film called Drunk Youth with the Chinese Barack_Obama Ending a meeting the pair waves and makes peace signs at the cameraYes Jia has seen about the assassination of Kim that led to the entertainment company being hacked by North_Korea He was not impressed with Randall Park the Korean American who played the dictatorIt would be safe to say that Jia is not on the brink of breaking into the big time His regular gigs involve appearing often alongside his self-appointed mentor a Mao Zedong impersonator named Xiong Ding Jian at minor events and standing around just looking like KimSometimes Jia breaks into a half-intelligible speech in Korean that hes memorized wishing people a happy new year and saying I love China When a reporter gently pointed out that he was saying hello in the South_Korean way not the version most commonly used in North_Korea Jia got defensive All Koreans speak the same language he said Unspoken Dont mess with my artLike the real Kim this doppelganger is afraid the Americans are after him Im afraid the Americans will come here to kill me That theyll think Im really Kim_Jong Un and will come here to kill me he said a little nervouslyBut that doesnt stop him from getting out and about in ChinaOn a recent day he appeared as a judge at a talent show in a dance school on the 19th floor of a high-rise building here in Taiyuan a second-tier city in Chinas industrial heartland As Taiyuans answer to Simon Cowell put the kids through their paces Jia sat there in his dark suit and darker glasses watching and occasionally clappingThe kids had no idea who he was supposed to be When one young girls mother said the leader of North_Korea the girls face remained blankJia and Xiong came to Taiyuan at the invitation of the local cultural heritage department and appeared at events with Mao praising the citys development while Kim stood alongside himOver lunch with Jia and Xiong afterward some locals praised the two strongmenWe are very honored to have them here We have a lot of respect for North_Korea and Kim_Jong Un because he is the leader of a socialist country said one of the pairs lunchmates a retired military educator who uttered words that wouldnt have been out of place in his classroomA businessman chimed in Kim_Jong Uns father had a really good friendship with China so we like the son We have a lot of respect for himAsked further about Chinas relationship with North_Korea the men demurred saying they were just common people who didnt know much about politics and suggesting that the subject was too sensitive to be discussedAsked what Mao would have made of Kim Xiong took the diplomatic route I dont_know thats for the older generation to answer he said If his father hadnt died we would be closer than we are now At that time North_Korea respected China As Mao said North_Korea should listen to its big brotherI care about the heart not the politics of being an actor Jia addedBut in matters of the heart hes not doing so well Xiong and the others tease Jia for being unmarried at 34 calling him an old man in an empty nestBut he rejects the suggestion that his Kim routine is damaging his chances I_think it probably helps he said adding that his profile picture entices women to start conversations with him Some girls think I look like a

the pro-President Trump CNN contributorTheir Friday conversation on Real Time with Bill Maher intensified then boiled over as they talked about whether alleged Russian vote manipulation helped make Trump presidentUnless you can manipulate the votes in the machine you havent done it Lord told MaherI like you and I heard youre a very nice guy but dont bull- me Maher replied There are other ways you can affect an election and one of them is to hack the emails of one side and release those as a slow drip drip drip drip dripThe pair continued to parry as the conversation pivoted to Trumps unreleased tax returnsRespectfully I say to you this becomes a political gotcha game Lord said defending the presidents decision to not release them We_need to get the country moving again rightNot if the country is being led by someone who was put there by a foreign power Maher repliedTrump and the people whove defended him on national television have faced a barrage of criticism over what role the Russian_government played in the 2016 electionAs The Washington_Posts The past few_days have brought a growing list of confirmed communications between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials with each new revelation adding to a cloud of suspicion that hangs over the White_House as critics demand an independent investigation The Trump administration at first denied any contact with the RussiansRecently the Trump team has acknowledged meetings happened but described them as polite introductions Helderman reportedMichael Flynn was forced to resign as national_security adviser because of his pre-inauguration contacts with Russian_Ambassador Sergey_Kislyak including a meeting alongside Trumps_son-in-law and senior adviser Jared KushnerThrough it all Lord has been helping to

thatBritish Prime_Minister Theresa May told congressional Republicans on Thursday that the election of President Trump had ushered in the dawn of a new era of American renewal and said the United_States and Britain could lead together again in a modern world fraught with uncertainty and dangerAddressing the GOP members of Congress at their annual retreat May walked a tightrope between praise for and criticism of the new administrations emerging foreign_policy alternating between support for some of the positions Trump has staked out and a clear rejection of othersShe urged engagement with Russia but to beware of its president Vladimir_Putin She defended the value of NATO and the United_Nations while acknowledging they need changes to meet current-day needs She criticized Irans support of the government in the Syrian civil_war and its malign influence in the region but defended the nuclear deal as deterring Tehran from building a bombMay said the United_States and Britain were working together to defeat the ideology of Islamist extremism but in an aside suggested she does_not back the idea of banning visitors and refugees from majority-Muslim countriesWe should always be careful to distinguish between this extreme and hateful ideology and the peaceful religion of Islam and the hundreds of millions of its adherents she said Nor is it enough merely to focus on violent extremism We_need to address the whole spectrum of extremism starting with the bigotry and hatred that can so often turn to violence Many of Mays remarks were met with enthusiastic applause and standing ovations even more_than when Trump spoke before the group earlier in the day On Friday May will be the first foreign leader to visit the White_House since Trump was sworn in and she spoke repeatedly of the special relationship between the United_States and Britain epitomized by the friendship between Republican president Ronald_Reagan and the Conservative prime_minister Margaret ThatcherAnother common theme was the alienation many Americans and Britons feel in an era of globalization helping sweep Trump and May before him to power Part of Mays mission is to promote trade between the two countries as Britain prepares to leave the European UnionPeople often those on modest incomes living in relatively rich countries like our own feel that the global system of free markets and free_trade is simply not working for them in its current form she saidThe speech gave May the opportunity to present Republicans with a sweeping vision of what she depicted as their shared conservative worldview one built on liberty open markets and universal rights To make her case she repeatedly invoked the three great heroes of conservative transatlantic history Churchill Reagan and ThatcherShe also used language notably more partisan than that of her predecessors hailing the November election as an opportunity for American renewalBecause of that great victory you have won she told the Republicans to loud applause America can be stronger greater and more confident in the years aheadBut amid her lavish praise were constant reminders of just how far Trump has deviated from the conservative worldview she describedOn trade security multinational institutions and most conspicuously on Russia May laid out stances that are in keeping with a long tradition of Western consensus but that Trump has unceremoniously discardedBy raising the differences without explicitly naming them May almost seemed to be willing Trump to return to the fold of traditional transatlantic foreign policyLess than a week after Trump proclaimed America first and suggested a shrinking global mandate for the United_States May informed the crowd that Global Britain intended to take on an even more internationalist role where we meet our responsibilities to our friends and allies champion the international cooperation and partnerships that project our values around the world and continue to act as one of the strongest and most forceful advocates for business free markets and free_trade anywhere around the globeAs if to underline just how far that vision is from Trumps as she spoke the White_House threatened to slap a 20_percent tariff on Mexican imports amid a dispute over who will pay for the presidents planned border wallUnlike Trump a vociferous critic of alliances and multilateral institutions May defended organizations such as the United_Nations NATO and even the EUIn contrast with Trumps protectionism she gave an enthusiastic endorsement of free_trade and aggressively plugged the US-British trade deal she hopes that she and Trump can ultimately reachThe most jarring difference_between May and Trump however was on Russia Although Trump has appeared eager to win over Putin May urged caution She offered support for nations in the Baltics that have been menaced by Russia and cited the illegal annexation of Crimea as legitimate reasons for them to feel afraid Although Trump has questioned whether the United_States should come to the defense of NATO_allies in the event of an attack May was unequivocalWe should not jeopardize the freedoms that President Reagan and Mrs Thatcher brought to Eastern Europe by accepting President Putins claim that it is now in his sphere of influence she said in a line that received thundering applauseWhen it comes to Russia as so often it is wise to turn to the example of President Reagan who during negotiations with his opposite number Mikhail Gorbachev used to abide by the adage Trust but verify she said in a speech that drew repeated rounds of applause and ovationsWith President Putin my advice is to engage but bewareMay also said she thought that Britain and America should never again invade foreign countries The days of Britain and America intervening in sovereign countries in an attempt to remake the world in our own image are over she saidBritish voters have defied the will of their leaders foreign allies and much of the political establishment by opting to rupture this countrys primary connection to Europe in a stunning result that will radiate economic and political uncertainty across the globeThe voters decision to jettison Britains membership in the European_Union was expected to jolt markets worldwide on Friday and unsettle Western capitals By the time the BBC had called the result at dawn in London Friday the pound had already plummeted to its lowest level against the dollar in decadesThe vote is perhaps the most dramatic to date in a wave of populist and nationalist uprisings occurring on both_sides of the Atlantic that are overturning traditional notions of what is politically possibleFor months the political and economic elite had looked on with growing apprehension as Britain flirted with a choice popularly known as Brexit that experts had warned could lead to global recession and a rip in the Western alliance The vote could also lead to Scottish secession a broader EU unraveling and the fall of Prime_Minister David Camerons governmentBut most analysts had predicted this pragmatically minded country would ultimately back away from the move and opt to keep Britain in an organization regarded as a pillar of the global economic and political order Instead a majority of British voters heeded the call of pro-Brexit campaigners to liberate the nation from what many here regard as an oppressive Brussels bureaucracy that enables mass migration into the countryLet June the 23rd go down in our history as our independence day cried a jubilant Nigel Farage a firebrand anti-EU leader in a 4 am celebration All around him leave campaigners clinked pints of beer and cheered their improbable victoryWhen polls closed six hours earlier Farage had all but conceded defeat saying he believed remain had won But as results poured in through Thursday night and into the early hours of Friday the remain camp was increasingly despairingAbout a third of results had yet to be counted as of 4 am local time But the BBC reported that leave had taken an insurmountable leadThe results came after 15 hours of voting from the remote Scottish isles to the tip of Gibraltar The outcome revealed vast divides with massive victory margins for remain in thriving metropolitan centers such as London and equally resounding victories for leave in small towns rural areas and struggling post-industrial cities As local authorities announced results markets swung wildly between optimism that the country would stay in the preferred choice of investors and pessimism that Britain had just voted to get outAfter initially rising to a 2016 high the pound plunged in international trading as jittery investors prepared for a scenario that had not been priced into market calculationsAs the hours ticked by there was a dawning realization that Britain could become the first country to leave the 28-member EU In television interviews remain supporters looked stricken and predicted catastropheGod help our_country tweeted Paddy Ashdown the former Liberal Democrat leader and an outspoken EU advocateThe outcome will rattle officials in Washington President Obama had made a high-profile plea for Britain to stay Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump who was in Scotland on Friday to open a golf course backed Brexit Although Britain may not actually leave the EU for years Thursdays vote fires the starting gun on what is widely expected to be a messy proceeding as Britain and EU officials begin untangling the vast web of connections between this island nation and the other 27 members of the blocThursdays outcome will be a crippling blow to Cameron who had campaigned vigorously for Britain to stay in the EU and had cast the referendum as a choice between an insular intolerant little England and an outward-looking pluralistic Great BritainHaving failed to convince a majority of voters he is expected to come under intense pressure to resignCameron initially promised the referendum in 2013 in a bid to unite the country and especially his Conservative Party behind a common stance on an issue that has divided public opinion here for decadesAt the time he may have expected a relatively easy victory But the campaign soon went off script as Justice Secretary Michael Gove and then-London Mayor Boris Johnson friends and sparring partners of Camerons since his days at Oxford both declared in February their intention to campaign for outThe populist-minded Johnson will now be seen as the most_likely successor to Cameron if the prime_minister is pushed from his perch at 10 Downing StreetI think the Boris Johnson momentum will be unstoppable said Steven Fielding a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham Cameron will try to find a dignified exit But its not clear how long the backbenchers will give him to do thatThe leave campaign found a compelling rallying cry with its call for voters to Take Back Control a slogan that resonated among an electorate ill at ease with record levels of immigration much of it from Europe under the EUs free-movement policyPolls suggested that leave alienated some voters with its reliance on what critics saw as increasingly nativist rhetoric That was particularly true after the killing last_week of pro-EU lawmaker Jo Cox a murder that appeared to awaken a passion in remain supporters that had been previously lackingA leave lead last_week in the polls diminished and the race turned into a dead heat Surveys released Thursday as Britons votesdhad shown remain with a clear edge results that cheered investors and boosted markets across Europe and AsiaBut as with last years British general election the polls were badly wrong apparently unable to capture the mood of an increasingly defiant electorateThe prevailing tone of the campaign on either side was fear and loathing with neither venturing for long into hope or aspirationThat spirit mirrored the angry mood of voters across the Atlantic in the United_States and surprised even close observers of a nation that sees itself as deeply pragmatic and rationalNotions of Britain as a deferential consensual society at ease with itself have been thrown out the window Fielding said This campaign has revealed a very profound mistrust among a substantial segment of society toward conventional political authority The EU became a lightning rod for mistrust of politics more broadlyThe vote split the country along essential lines Old versus young Provincial versus metropolitan Scotland versus England Native-born Britons versus immigrants As the first votes were cast nationwide with the often-variable British weather running the gamut from a torrential downpour in London to sunny clear skies in Scotland anxiety was the prevailing moodHilary Clarke a 45-year-old stay-at-home mom was the first to vote at a southwest London polling station She said she would use her stubby pencil to check remain on her ballotIf I had been confident I wouldnt be standing in the rain at 7 in the morning she said as she sheltered beneath a colorful umbrella The reason Im first in the queue is Im_going straight to the airport to go to Barcelona and I may not return if vote goes the wrong wayClarke said she could not understand the logic of those pushing for leaveI can see that sometimes it seems we are hemorrhaging money to the EU she said But at the same_time we seem to get so much more back than we give Even if youre disagreeing with whats said at the table its better to have a place at itBut for leave voters Britains four decades of membership in the European_Union and its precursors have only dragged the country downAndreas Hajialexandrou a 48-year-old businessman of Greek Cypriot heritage said the country could simply not withstand the impact of record numbers of immigrants from elsewhere in EuropeThere are pressures on local services I speak to our local [doctors] and they are just swamped he said The question is how long can you support that level of immigrationInside a dark chemistry lab in a derelict old building Pvt Shane Diaz gingerly drew 13 milliliters of an unknown brown liquid from a glass flask up into a syringeBreathing through a gas mask that made him sound like Darth Vader he was careful not to spill a drop as he put it into a sample jar Who knew what chemical_weapons the North_Koreans had been making hereRemove the tubing from the syringe and be mindful of the needle it might come out Sgt Tyler Lawrence said from behind him And when you get the tubing out kill itEverything had to be done exactly by the book These samples could be used to prosecute Kim_Jong Un and his cronies with war crimes before the International Criminal Court Or at_least thats what the American soldiers were training forThe US and South_Korean militaries are staging their an eight-week exercise involving everything from amphibious landing exercises on southern beaches to computer-simulated decapitation strikes aimed_at taking out the leaders of a certain regime just to the northAbout 17000 American troops and 300000 South_Korean personnel are taking part in computer-simulated exercises which end this weekend and field drills that continue through the end of April The allies scenario is clear to prepare to go into North_Korea after the regime in Pyongyang collapses or after it orders a suicidal invasion of the SouthThe exercises come at a particularly tense time on the Korean_Peninsula with punishment for the Norths recent nuclear_test and missile_launch biting at the same timePyongyang has been making its unhappiness with both developments loud and clear threatening preemptive strikes or claiming some major technological advance on a daily basisThe DPRKs army will reduce all bases and strongholds of the US and south Korean warmongers for provocation and aggression into ashes in a moment without giving them any breathing spell the state-run_Korean Central_News Agency said in a recent commentary about the exercises using the official abbreviation for North_Korea While North_Korea has been threatening to use its nuclear_weapons a key component of the drills involves dealing with chemical or biological agents About 700 soldiers 100 of them South_Korean are taking part in a series of 28 drills over 18 daysIn addition to its nuclear_weapons program the Kim regime is thought to possess chemical_weapons including nerve agents such as sarin gas that it can make domesticallyEvidence suggests that North_Korea has significant quantities and varieties of chemical_weapons Joseph S Bermudez an expert on North_Koreas defense It also has to a lesser extent the ability to employ these weapons worldwide using unconventional methods of deliveryThe use of chemical_weapons in Syrias civil_war has shown how devastating this form of warfare can be and has refocused some attention on the Norths presumed programsAt a largely unused army base north of Seoul close to the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas soldiers were practicing what to do if they came across a clandestine chemical_weapons lab in North KoreaAt a drill Monday soldiers in full combat gear from an Army unit based at Fort Hood Tex stormed the dilapidated building chosen because it was similar to what American soldiers might actually encounter in North_Korea and swept through the dark rooms guns drawn In the building they found 55-gallon drums with liquid on top empty munitions shells and a filling station a chemical lab with a sign reading quality inspection in Korean on the outside A sharp odor pervaded the space (it was Bengay that the soldiers had smeared on the walls for verisimilitude)Its more real here for sure Its a real-life scenario said 1st Lt Jonathan OConnell who had come in from Fort Hood for the exercises There are multiple known sites that are literally hours away from here by footSeeing it was clearly a chemical_weapons site the soldiers called in specialists from the US Armys 2nd Infantry Division the only division with a full chemical battalion and the only chemical_weapons team stationed outside the United StatesEnter Pvt Orin Johnson the team leader with his notebooks and camera Pvt Charles Kimiaga with a bucket filled with plastic sheeting and glass jars and Diaz with a scanner that started beeping immediately They were decked out in Mopp 4 gear the highest level of protective suits with gloves and boot covers taped onto their suitsUnder the close inspection of Lawrence their evaluator the three slowly moved through the rooms with their vapor detector radioing in their findings along the way It looked like a cross between CSI and Breaking BadOur guys need to be able to identify whats_going on and understand whats on the site and understand whats there said Lt Col Adam Hilburgh the battalion commander We use the current intelligence picture to tailor our training to thatIf they were to actually find chemical or biological agents in North_Korea the soldiers would have to take samples and keep them secure so they could be introduced at the International Criminal Court Hilburgh saidIn the chemical lab Lawrence told the men to get out their kill bucket They promptly set_up a yellow bucket bag and poured in powder to kill whatever liquid was inside the flasksLawrence was not impressed with the time it was taking The [chemical] process is still ongoing he barked Youre assisting the enemyThe trio set about putting samples into glass jars 10 milliliters or about two teaspoons was all the court would need Lawrence said and analyzing them in the scannerIt turned_out it was lewisite a blister agent (Anti-lewisite pills were found in another room along with the supposed North_Korean gas masks)The soldiers prepared to package it up and ship out the liquids before moving steadily up the difficulty ladderNext on their training list going underground to practice working in tunnels containing radioactive material and very little oxygenSecretary of State John_F Kerry and Chinas foreign_minister agreed Wednesday to move ahead with a UN resolution condemning North_Korea for its but they appeared as far apart as ever on how far to push PyongyangThe United_States says any additional UN action against the North is likely to include expanded sanctions Beijing a key ally of North_Koreas at the nuclear_test this month but has not indicated whether it will endorse further pressureAs a permanent UN_Security Council member China could use its veto power to block any measuresAfter a five-hour meeting between Kerry and Foreign_Minister Wang Yi the two diplomats appeared before reporters with tension written across their faces Wang drummed his fingers on the side of his lectern as a grim-faced Kerry excoriated the actions of North_Korea and its erratic leader_Kim Jong UnKerry used unusually forceful language about the dangers posed by Pyongyang Wang repeatedly mentioned the need for stability on the Korean_Peninsula While both agreed that more sanctions are warranted they said the details would have to be resolved in talks at the UN_Security Council in coming days Kim_Jong Uns actions are reckless and they are dangerous Kerry said of the leader whose regime has been backed by China for six decades Whether or not he achieved the explosion of a hydrogen weapon is not what makes the difference Its that he is tryingSix-party talks also involving South_Korea Russia and Japan began in 2003 but failed to make headway North_Korea conducted its first nuclear_test in 2006 and finally quit the talks in 2009 It has since conducted three tests the most recent on Jan6China has voted in the UN_Security Council to sanction North_Korea over its previous nuclear_tests and it has condemned the latest one But Wang made clear that China is prepared to go only so farSanctions are not an end in themselves he said Our goal should be to bring the nuclear issue on the Korea Peninsula back to the negotiating track Kerry declined to be specific about what sectors might be affected by sanctions But he suggested they might include trade involving the flow of goods and services between North_Korea and China shipping and aviation as well as resource exchanges involving coal and other fuelThere are many different ways we think in which non-punitive to the people of North_Korea but nevertheless effective steps can be taken he said Kerry came to Beijing as part of an effort by US officials to persuade the Chinese government to press Pyongyang to give up its nuclear_program He said China has a special role to play because it serves as the Norths lifeline providing food fuel and a conduit for most of its trade and financial transactionsIn Beijing analysts and state media argued that pushing North_Korea further could make it more aggressive or hasten the regimes collapse propelling a stream of refugees into China and potentially installing a US client state on its border Washington is exacerbating the situation they saidBut Kerry made clear that the strategy of relying on Beijing to prod Pyongyang needs to change He said North_Koreas stated intention of acquiring intercontinental_ballistic missiles threatens the United_States which he said will never accept North_Korea as a nuclear-armed stateThe United_States will take all necessary steps to defend the American people and to honor our security commitments to allies in the region he said I say that making clear we do not want to raise military tensions we are not seeking additional steps other than UN_Security Council_resolutions but we will not walk away from any actions necessary to achieve the goalKerry also held out a carrot to North_Korea saying it would get sanctions relief economic help energy and food aid plus direct humanitarian assistance if it ends its nuclear programYet even as he stood alongside Wang after their lengthy meeting which extended into lunch Kerry seemed to be pleading with China to do more to rein in its neighbor noting that China was one of five countries that negotiated an agreement to trim Irans nuclear programNuclear-related sanctions against Iran were lifted this month once Iran pared down its uranium stockpiles and disabled or mothballed parts of its nuclear facilitiesWith all due respect more significant and impactful sanctions were put in place against Iran which did_not have a nuclear_weapon than against North_Korea which does he saidIn contrast Wangs words were laced with reluctanceOur position will not be swayed by specific events or the temporary mood of the moment he saidWang said China is committed to the denuclearization of the Korean_Peninsula but he said two other principles are equally important The commitment to uphold peace and stability The commitment to resolve the issue through dialogue and consultationIn the past Washington has used less confrontational language than Kerry employed Wednesday hoping China would use its clout to pressure North_Korea on its own But in recent_weeks US officials have shown signs that their patience is wearing thinYanmei Xie senior China analyst with the International Crisis Group in Beijing said US officials may have recognized the limits of their softer approachNow they appear to be trying a different approach raising the stakes for China of what the US sees as inaction over North_Korea she said I_think the US is not pretending anymoreChinas foreign_minister has a plan to ease tensions in East_Asia North_Korea should stop testing missiles and the United_States and South_Korea should stop joint military_exercises he said WednesdayThe comment was delivered at a news_conference in Beijing two days after North_Korea test-fired four_missiles and the United_States and South_Korea began deploying a new missile_defense system raising regional tension and renewing about Asia policy under President TrumpChinas suggestion is as a first step for North_Korea to suspend nuclear activity and for the US and South_Korea to also suspend large-scale military drills Chinese Foreign_Minister Wang Yi said This he said could get all sides back to the negotiating tableWang warned that the United_States and North_Korea appear headed for a collision The two sides are like two accelerating trains coming toward each_other with neither side willing to give way he saidThe question is Are the two sides really ready for a head-on collision Our priority now is to flash the red light and apply the brakes on both trains What Wang proposed Wednesday is not new North_Korea has suspension for suspension many times and the United_States has balkedBut this is the first time it has been raised under Trump presenting some new possibilities said John Delury an assistant professor at Seouls Yonsei University We dont_know what Trump is going to do about North_Korea Delury said There is a policy review underway now and it looks like all options are on the table At the heart of all this is a question about Beijings role in relations among China North_Korea South_Korea Japan and the United_States particularly as Washington charts a new foreign_policy under TrumpIn February North_Korea tested a solid-fuel_rocket that it claimed was part of an_intercontinental ballistic_missile capable of hitting the United_States The country was then linked to the killing in Malaysia of ruler Kim_Jong Uns_half brother who had been under Chinese protectionOn Monday as Chinas National Peoples Congress opened in Beijing and US-South Korea military_exercises got underway Pyongyang launched four_missiles target practice it saidAll sides have condemned North_Koreas actions What they cannot agree on is what to do nextChina says the conflict should be solved by the United_States and North_Korea But Washington has long argued that the conflict cannot be resolved without more help from ChinaNorth Korea and China were once as close as lips and teeth as communist revolutionary leader Mao Zedong put it Although they are still technically allies Wang resurrected Maos lips and teeth line Wednesday China is frustrated by North_Koreas nuclear theatrics and exhausted by its economic woesAfter Februarys rocket_launch Beijing closed loopholes in an existing effort to curb North_Korean coal imports a sector seen as a financial lifeline for Kims regimeChinese experts insist that Beijing has few remaining options when it comes to Pyongyang mostly because North_Korea sees the development of its nuclear_program as the only way to protect against the United_States the North would rather have no coal or no cash than cease to exist the theory goes Even if China stops oil aid to North_Korea it will still not give up developing nuclear_weapons saidYang Xiyu a senior fellow at the China Institute of International_Studies in Beijing Indeed despite their many differences Beijing and Pyongyang share a belief that the presence of US troops in South_Korea is the root of regional conflict a view highlighted this week when China lashed out at the United_States and South_Korea over the deployment of a new antimissile systemThe United_States and South_Korea say theTerminal High_Altitude Area_Defense (THAAD)_system is necessary to shoot down North_Korean missiles China believes it could be used to spy on Chinese airspace Although Trumps precise plans are unknown his previous comments on North_Korea suggest that he thinks it is up to China to play a bigger role The THAAD_deployment however could make it tougher to get Beijing on boardExperts said Trump seems unlikely for now to accept Wangs proposalThere is very little possibility that they will get back to talks said Zhang Liangui a North_Korea expert at the Communist Partys Central Party SchoolThat means the next move will probably come from Washington and depend on Trump We just hope that the US can solve this Zhang said Congcong_Zhang and Jin Xin contributed to this reportTheres a chill in the air in Dandong these days and not just because winter is comingA steady stream of trucks still rumble across the single-lane bridge from China to North_Korea from dawn until dusk every day and North_Koreans can still be seen in the streets and in the restaurants of this grimy border city the commercial gateway to the isolated stateBut tradinghas become significantly harder in recent_weeks a dozen people involved indoing businesswith North_Korea said in interviews the result of a double-pronged attempt by Beijing to communicate its anger with the regime in PyongyangEverythings become tougher since September a Korean Chinese factory owner who employs North_Korean workers here told The Washington_Post This crackdownis because of the missile and nuclear_tests and it doesnt look like its going to blow overThis news might be slightly more encouraging than official Washington has been expecting but only slightly Although China is annoyed with North_Korea its primary consideration keeping the regime afloat has not changedIndeed the chillhere is partly because of the tough international sanctions_imposed in March after North_Korea conducted its fourth_nuclear test They are aimed_at cutting off North Koreasability to earn hard currency through coal exports and shippingBut an equal or even bigger influence is the surprise detention of a prominent Dandong business executive a member of the Communist Party no less who stands accused of helping North_Korea dodge sanctions and obtain materials for its weapons programWhen business people hear this kind of story of course we feel very constrained and it makes us very cautious a South_Korean businessman trading in this area said on the condition of anonymity The atmosphere is so tense that none of the business executives interviewed were willing to be publicly identified even as they insisted that everything was aboveboardBusiness is down but no one knows how long that will last Even now there are plenty of ambiguous signs The annual trade fair here was canceled yet coal exports from North_Korea are breaking records China holds the lever and its intentions can be only speculated uponFor more_than a decade the international_community led by the United_States has tried to inflict economic pain on North_Korea in an effort to convince it that the costs of pursuing a nuclear_weapons program outweigh any benefitsIncreasingly tight rounds of sanctions have however clearly failed to change the regimes calculus North_Koreas leader_Kim Jong_Un has ordered and dozens of missile_launches this year apparently aiming to produce a nuclear_weapon capable of reaching the US mainland Sanctions are the only tool that the international_community really has given that there is no appetite for engagement and even less for military actionIn March the UN_Security Council passed a resolution that among other tough measures ordered mandatory inspections of all cargo going into North_Korea and banned North_Korean exports of coal iron and iron ore unless they are for livelihood purposesBut with almost all North_Korean trade going through China and Dandong specifically sanctions are only as effective as Beijing wants them to be Beijing doesnt want the collapse of its impoverished nuclear-armed neighbor and it certainly doesnt want the 28000 American troops stationed in South_Korea to be able to move right up to the peninsulas border with ChinaChina has a permanent interest in keeping North_Korea afloat no matter what said Andrei Lankov a Korea expert who teaches at Kookmin University in Seoul You will never be able to persuade China to do something differentAs a result this frontier There were alwaysofficials willing to turn a blind eye middlemen brokering deals in the shadows entrepreneurs looking to gain a foothold in what they hoped would becomean increasingly open marketSanctions were a matter for faraway Beijing and even farther-away Washington But theres a shift in the wind And the question now is After the nuclear_tests and missile_launches including three while China was hosting the Group of 20 summit meeting in September is President_Xi Jinping angry enough to inflict a little more pain on KimWhat was once a black-and-white picture China supported sanctions in principle but not in practice has become a complicated gray oneThere is plenty of activity going on here Dozens of trucks laden with steel rebar and sacks of cement line up on the road outside the customs house every day waiting to cross into North KoreaAt the main logistics center everything from tangerines to a Mercedes-Benz SUV without tags was being prepared for export on a recent day The customs process has become a little more complicated said a North_Korean driver with a truck full of tiles But if you pay its okaySolar panels and generators continue to be popular and there are still tens of thousands of North_Korean laborers here And trade in coal which makes up about 40_percent of North_Koreas exports hit a record in AugustThat is because China has a different interpretation of the livelihood exception said Western diplomats involved in the process While the international_community has focused on the ban China is focusing on the exception Diplomats in Beijing are highly doubtful that the Chinese government has any intention to seriously punish North_Korea expressing frustration at the coal figures and skepticism about reports of tougher times on the borderIn the wake of Septembers nuclear_test the United_States has been pushing the United_Nations to close the loophole but China has resistedChina still believes it should not hurt ordinary people in North_Korea said Zhang Tuosheng director of research at the China Foundation for International and Strategic StudiesThe main problem is that the gap_between the US and China on North_Korea is so huge Zhang said I dont_think China would agree to close the livelihood exception That would damage ordinary peopleBut one joint action even if it wasgrudging has had a tangible impactIn September the US Justice_Department and its chief_executive Ma Xiaohong accusing her of using the company as a front to channel American dollars to North_Korea helping it to finance its nuclear_weapons program It was the first time Washington had used secondary sanctions to punish a Chinese entity for helping North KoreaChinese provincial authorities while saying their actions were independent responded by detaining Ma and launching an investigation of Hongxiang alleging the company committed serious economic crimesThat someone who was such a big mover and shaker here could be stopped in her tracks has sent shivers through DandongMa was a city official and the government doesnt usually mess with people like that Its had a very serious impact here the Korean Chinese factory owner saidThe South_Korean businessman echoed this sentiment I personally think that the Hongxiang case has had a bigger impact than sanctions The vibe I get is that people are being cautiousIn interviews businessmen detailed an increasingly difficult operatingenvironment Last year I did about 10 big deals construction equipment automobiles but this year Ive done none said a Korean Chinese intermediary who brokers deals for investors on both_sides of the borderThe actions and specifically those against Hongxiang have riled some localsDandong people are feeling insulted like the Americans are bullying us said a man who said his name was Wang and who drives business people around town This was business approved by the governments in China and North_Korea You can link any material to nuclear development if you want toPeople involved in the Hongxiang case warn against seeing Chinas response as the start of a broader crackdown with one saying that getting Beijing to act was exceptionally difficultBut recent evidence shows Lankov said that Beijing has decided to enforce and not enforce sanctions in a new controlled wayThis is all being done at the central-government level assuming that low-level officials are difficult to control Lankov said They need it to be planned and measuredChina will always put its interests first he saidThey want to have the situation under control They will keep North_Korea afloat but the central government in Beijing will decide which buttons to push and whenHow long will this chill lastBusiness executives here said they hope that it wont continue much longer Whenever there are specific events China shows that they have tightened up for a short period But after some time it goes back to business as usual said one of the South Koreans who spoke to The PostBut the ball is in North_Koreas courtIt depends on whether there is a sixth nuclear_test or not the Korean Chinese middleman said If that happens things are going to

North_Korea overand the assassination of Kim_Jong Uns_half brother in MalaysiaKim Jong_Nam had been hosted and protected by China for many years and his murder if proved to be conducted on Pyongyangs orders would be seen as a direct affront to Beijing experts said China has also come under significant international pressure to do more to rein in North_Koreas nuclear_weapons and ballistic_missile programs whileChinese President_Xi Jinping is believed to have become increasingly irritated by Kim_Jong Uns behaviorNorth Korea is Chinas fourth-biggest supplier of coal Although China announced in April that it would ban North_Korean coal imports to comply with UNsanctions it made exceptions for deliveries intended for the peoples well-being and not connected to North Koreasmissile programsIn practice that exception was the cover for coal to continue to flow across the border in huge quantities with imports of non-lignite coal up 145percent last_year to 225 million metric tons (248 million US tons)But in a sign that Beijings patience was running out it rejected a coal shipment from North_Korea worth about $1million Monday the day after the test of an intermediate-range ballistic_missile South_Koreas Yonhap_News Agency reportedChina has long been reluctant to do anything that might threaten the stability of the North_Korean regime mainly because it fears that the reunification of the Korean_Peninsula could bring South_Korea an American ally that hosts US troops right up to its borderGiven that a total ban on coal imports could be destabilizing it remains to be seen how firmly the pledge will be carried_out But Pyongyangs unwillingness to consider Chinas interests has badly damaged or even destroyed trust between the long-standing alliesChina still places a premium on stability but Xi_Jinping is growing more and more frustrated with Kim_Jong Un saidPaul Haenle director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing adding that the missile_test and the assassination were seen as serious offensesBeijing took the assassination as a direct affront to China Xi is less willing to tolerate these provocations he said China is putting a squeeze on its economic lifeline to send a message to PyongyangWang Weimin a professor at the School of International Relations and Public_Affairs at Fudan University in Shanghai said sympathy for North_Koreas national_security concerns had disappeared in Beijing and blood ties_between the countries had been broken as it became clear that the regime could not be tamedIf we choose an ally that cant be tamed we might become the biggest loser he said Thats why we are more and more strict with North_Korea Now self-interest is central We wont pay attention to North_Koreas interests anymorePresident Trump hasalso called on China to put more pressure on North_Korea to stop its nuclear_weapons program and the subject may have come up during a telephone conversation he had with Xi earlier_this monthChina hastotal control over North_Korea Trump said in an_interview on Fox & Friends in early January And China should solve that problem And if they dont solve the problem we should make trade very difficult for China The UN_Security Council condemned North_Koreas latest missile_test Monday and urged members to redouble efforts to enforce sanctions That appeal came after an emergency meeting in New_York called by the United_States Japan and South_Korea Jin Xin contributed to this_reportThe United_States rebuffed a proposal from China to apply the brakes to an escalating standoff with North_Korea saying positive action was required before it would engage with the irresponsible Kim_Jong UnChina was trying to mediate the rising tensions in East_Asia which pit its once-close ally North_Korea against the United_States and its evolving foreign_policy under President TrumpThe North_Koreans have given us enough reason to think how irresponsible they are with little cause to believe that were dealing with a rational person on this said Nikki Haley the US ambassador to the United_Nations Speaking to reporters Wednesday after an emergency UN_Security Council meeting on North_Korea she added We have to see some sort of positive action by North_Korea before we can take them seriouslyThere has been no official Chinese reaction to the snubChinas foreign_minister Wang Yi Wednesday to suspend missile_tests in return for a suspension of US-South Korea military exercisesWang compared the United_States and North_Korea to two accelerating trains coming toward each_other with neither side willing to give wayHe cast China as a railway worker or signalman trying to keep things on track though US critics argue that China is not a neutralsignalman but Pyongyangs patronA suspension for suspension deal Wang argued was key to preserving peace and getting back to the negotiating tableWhat he proposed has been pitched before by North_Korea and rejected by the United_States But with the Trump administration still fleshing out its foreign_policy some experts wondered whether the proposal had a shotIt did_not Haley said the administration is still deciding how to proceed I can tell_you were not ruling anything out and were considering every option thats on the table she saidThey may need to move quickly The early months of the Trump presidency have coincided with a surge of tension in AsiaIn February North_Korea a solid-fuel_rocket that it claimed was part of an_intercontinental ballistic_missile capable of hitting the United StatesSoon after the country was linked to the in Malaysia of Kim_Jong Uns_half brother Kim_Jong Nam who had been under Chinese protectionThen on Monday as US-South Korean military_exercises got underway Pyongyang launching four_missiles that landed in waters off the Japanese coastThe same night the United_States and South_Korea pushed ahead with the long-planned deployment of an antimissile_system that China strongly opposesAt the center of this complex and evolving conflict are questions about Chinas ties to North_Korea and the US role in East Asian affairs particularly under TrumpChina and North_Korea see the presence of US troops in South_Korea as the root of regional conflict and they wantthe United_States to acknowledge or address thisThe United_States and South_Korea are focused on the North_Korean threatThey say THAAD is a defensive system designed to shoot down North_Korean missilesBut China believes that THAAD could be used to spy on Chinese airspace and sees the system as evidence of US military meddling in Asian affairs After the deployment on Monday Chinas Foreign_Ministry warned of unspecified consequences for the United_States and South_Korea and has continued to target South_Korean business interestsThe United_States meanwhile has pushed for China to play a more assertive role in reining in North KoreaWith Chinese leaders outraged over THAAD the for the Trump administration will be getting them to abandon their patronage of North_Korea Jin Xin contributed to this reportIn a US election cycle where it often seems that nobody agrees on anything the presidential front-runners appear to share one article of faith China is the key to fixing North KoreaAsked how they would handle Pyongyang and have all mentioned the need to push or pressure China to do moreNow come reports that China and the United_States are making on a UN resolution to tighten sanctions on North_Korea On Wednesday diplomats at the UN_Security Council said the two permanent members of the body have reached an agreement on the draft resolution that could be presented to the full council for approval within days Last week President Obama targeting banks and trading companies many of them Chinese linked to North_Koreas weapons_programs illicit activities and human_rights abusesThe United_States pressures China China pressures North_Korea Case closedIf only it were that simpleA US-China deal if it goes forward would be good news for the Obama_administration a diplomatic ray of light amid the gloom in the region over disputes in It could also hurt North_Korean leader_Kim Jong_Un and his cronies experts sayBut another tougher round of sanctions is far from the cure-all that some politicians imagine China and the United_States remain at odds over what the new rules are supposed to achieve Everyone is talking_about sanctions said Stephan Haggard a North_Korea expert at the University of California at San Diego But we have to ask Sanctions to what endAsking China to act on North_Korea makes sense Beijing and Pyongyang are frenemies really and it is no secret that North_Koreas economy is sustained in large part by trade across the Chinese borderThe latest US proposal calls for a more aggressive targeting of the firms that keep Kim in business including secondary sanctions against companies that do business with those firmsThe strategy is designed to hit Kim where it hurts said Sung-Yoon Lee a Korea specialist at Tufts Universitys Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy The North_Korean people are uniquely isolated and cut_off but the regime is not It depends on cash flow depends on international financial transactions and depends on the dollar system to feed the eliteThis approach has worked before Nearly a decade_ago by a Macau-based institution that handled North_Korean money the United_States cut_off Pyongyangs cash supply and brought North_Korea back to nuclear negotiations (Those talks later fell apart)Tong Zhao an expert on nuclear disarmament at Beijings Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy said the measures being formulated are not just about finance but also are an effort by the United_States to put more pressure on ChinaBeijing has long opposed unilateral sanctions and is wary of any move that might hurt its economy or cause instability across the border At the same_time it is increasingly frustrated by North_Korea and worried about a That makes Beijing more receptive to sanctions that or so Washington hopesAfter Obama signed the new sanctions legislation last_week a South_Korean newspaper that ICBC a major Chinese bank was curbing its business in North_Korea according to a branch near the border The report was of a potential shift in Chinas strategyBut calls to several banks in Dandong a key hub at the China-North Korea border suggest that the policy direction is far from clear Reached by phone workers at Bank of China China Merchants Bank and Bank of Dandong branches said they no_longer did business with North_Korea An employee at China Construction Bank said it was doing business with North_Korea but would not go into detailsNorth Korea watchers warned against seeing the ICBC anecdote or any branchs statement as proof of a real push to stop cross-border transactions Weve seen this movie before China starts to enforce some sanctions and then a month later they loosen up again said Bonnie Glaser a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International_Studies in WashingtonThe Chinese might be looking for some things to do to ease the pressure that the US is putting on them she saidAlthough China says it supports UN_Security Council_resolutions on North_Korea it has a bad enforcement record according to UN and reportingThe North_Korean regime has deep connections to various sectors of Chinas economy A real or rumored crackdown at the big banks is unlikely to prevent smaller banks from moving money across the border let alone curb the trade in resources experts saidIts inconvenient as hell for North_Koreans to move cash across borders but this relationship is way bigger than banking said Adam Cathcart who studies China and North_Korea at the University of Leeds in BritainReached by telephone a man who gave his name as Mr Han who works at a Chinese company that imports minerals from North_Korea dismissed the idea of tighter sanctions with a profanity He said he moves his money through local banks or in cash without any problem I can basically do anything he saidAnother mineral trader who identified himself only as Mr Cai said that US sanctions would not hurt him but that UN measures could make a dent if China chose to enforce themBoth said business is down because of a slump in commodity prices not as a result of politicsHaggard the North_Korea expert at the University of California at San Diego said the economic slump plus sanctions could increase pressure on Pyongyang But that does_not mean a lasting solution is in sight he saidEven with China on board there is no quick fix Liu Liu Gu Jinglu and Xu Jing contributed to this reportChina warned Tuesday of consequences for South_Korea and the United_States over the deployment of a US antimissile_system further raising regional tension and posing a challenge to the Trump administrationThe stern words came a day after North_Korea launched four_missiles that landed off the Japanese coast an exercise the North_Korean government said designed to practice for in JapanAmerican and South_Korean officials say the continuing missile_launches by the North_Koreans demonstrate why the new antimissile_system is necessary as a defense against Kim_Jong Uns_regime The US military began the Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defense_(THAAD) system to South_Korea on MondayBut Beijing as a threat to the Chinese military and evidence of US meddling in East Asian affairs I want to emphasize that we firmly oppose the deployment of THAAD Geng_Shuang a spokesman for Chinas Foreign_Ministry said Tuesday at a daily news briefing in Beijing We will resolutely take necessary measures to defend our security interestsAll consequences entailed from this will be borne by the US and the Republic of KoreaGeng did_not provide details on what consequences are in store for either country although South_Korean officials said they expected retaliatory moves against companies doing business in ChinaThe stepped-up tensions in East_Asia create a potentially difficult and multipronged problem for the United_States involving South_Korea in the midst of internal political turmoil North_Korea often

from leaving its territory prompting the Malaysian government to accuse it of hostage takingMalaysia retaliated by banning all North_Koreans from exiting its borders and warning the Kim regime that it was inviting further international opprobrium China was angered by the Feb13 murder which the Malaysians say employed VX nerve agent and some analysts suggest the North_Korean missile_launch was secondarily designed to provoke BeijingIn Washington State_Department spokesman Mark Toner reiterated US criticism of North_Korea and the missile_launches Theyre increasingly becoming a pariah through this kind of behavior he said Were pursuing tougher and tougher sanctions but were also looking at other means to make that message clear to themChinas Foreign_Ministry did_not specify any actions against the United_States on Tuesday but Beijings displeasure over the antimissile_system marked an abrupt change in tone after a generally cautious approach until now toward the new American presidentAlthough some Chinese initially welcomed the idea of Donald Trumps presidency convinced a seasoned businessman would take a practical approach to politics Trumps early moves on Taiwan Since the inauguration Chinese officials have taken a careful approach playing up the positive and playing down areas of disagreement including Trump administration comments on the South China_Sea That is until Gengs statement on Tuesday Plans to deploy the THAAD_system which predates the Trump presidency have long been a source of tension between Seoul and BeijingIn the run-up to the deployment China has taken aim atSouth Korean businesses in China Beginning on Friday it has been warning would-be Chinese_tourists against booking trips to South_Korea Although some travel agencies have already stopped selling tickets and tours to South_Korea Chinas National Tourism Administration has officially ordered travel agencies to stop all tour groups and cruise ships by March15 the South_Korean official saidThe new measures would also shut_down duty-free shops run by Lotte the South_Korean conglomerate that helped Seoul secure land for THAAD according to the South_Korean officialA

tourism representative spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to give information to the news mediaThree large Chinese travel agencies confirmed the order from the Tourism Administration Two said they have already stopped selling packages the other said it would stop selling by March 15After Lotte helped the South_Korean government secure land for THAAD it was denounced and threatened in Chinas Communist Party-controlled press Nearly two dozen of the companys retail outlets were subsequently shut_down by Chinese authorities for alleged safety violations China recently rejected applications by Korean airlines to add charter flights on popular tourists routes a move interpreted in South_Korea as a on the missile systemThere have also been scattered

close to the matter said the campaign and the DNC were not informed by the law_firm of Fusion GPSs roleThe dossier has become a lightning rod amid the intensifying investigations into the Trump

said he wasnt aware of the hiring during the campaignThe first I learned of Christopher_Steele or saw any dossier was after the election Fallon said But if I had gotten handed it last fall I would have had no problem passing it along and urging reporters to look into itSome of the details are included in a Tuesday letter sent by Perkins_Coie to a lawyer representing Fusion_GPS telling the research firm that it was released from a client-confidentiality obligation The letter was prompted by a legal fight over a subpoena for Fusion GPSs bank recordsPeople involved in the matter said that

presidential primaries when the GOP_donor paid for the firm to investigate the real_estate magnates backgroundFusion GPS did_not start off looking at Trumps Russia ties but quickly realized that those relationships were extensive according to the people_familiar with the matter Those people said that it is standard practice for political campaigns to use law firms to hire outside researchers to ensure their work is protected by attorney-client and work-product privilegesThe Clinton campaign paid Perkins_Coie $56 million in legal fees from June 2015 to December 2016 according to campaign finance records and the DNC paid the firm $36 million in legal and compliance consulting since November 2015 though its impossible to tell from the filings how_much of that work was for other legal

salvo this week unsealing charges_against three former Trump campaign aides thought to have engaged in a medley of wrongdoingThe cases he revealed legal_analysts said indicate he is pursuing an extensive probe that will explore both personal wrongdoing of those connected with President Trump and possible efforts campaign officials took to work with Russia to influence the 2016 electionCollusion the word Trump often uses to describe Muellers case even as he asserts such a thing never happened is not itself a crime and Muellers_team will probably have to sort through unseemly political dealings to determine_whether a law was broken legal_analysts said In his first public charges though Mueller offered a hint of the direction he might take Former campaign foreign_policy adviser George_Papadopoulos for example pleaded_guilty to making a false statement to FBI investigators who asked about his contacts with foreigners claiming to have high-level Russian connectionsOf particular note he falsely described his interactions with a London-based professor claiming to have connections to high-level Russian officials who purportedly had dirt on Hillary_Clinton in the form of thousands of emailsPapadopoulos said his interactions with the professor thought to be occurred before he joined the campaign and did_not amount to much In fact the professor told him about the emails in April_2016 after his role on the campaign was made public and the two were involved in extensive discussions about a possible meeting between the Trump campaign and Russian officials according to Papadopouloss plea_agreement The conversation about emails is possibly a critical piece of evidence legal_analysts said That is because one charge that investigators might try to substantiate against those higher in the Trump campaign is a conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse ActIf Mueller can find evidence that members of Trumps team conspired in Russias hacking effort by directing it or aiding in another way they might face criminal_charges legal_analysts said Papadopouloss plea says that he discussed some of his efforts to broker a meeting with the Russians with other more senior Trump campaign officials although some seemed to treat him warily Theres a significant difference_between the Russians having dirt and offering that dirt and someone asking the Russians to commit an illegal act to obtain that dirt said Jacob Frenkel a white-collar lawyer at Dickinson Wright who previously worked in the now-defunct Office of the Independent Counsel The latter likely would be prosecutable and probably as a conspiracy to commit a computer crime or as a computer crimePapadopouloss conversation about emails of Clinton took_place a month after and well before Also it was not until June_2016 that that the Democratic_National Committees computer network had been breachedBut at that time it was well known that Clinton had deleted tens of thousands of emails she deemed personal from her private_server Those messages were of great interest to Republicans who believed they might show something nefariousIt was unclear to what emails the professor was referring or if he truly had access to any messages damaging to Clinton Jonathan Biran a former federal_prosecutor now in private practice at Biran Kelly said Muellers_team is probably asking What did people within the campaign know about how those emails had been obtained and whether they had reason to believe they were illegally obtainedAaron Zelinsky a lawyer in the special_counsels office said at Papadopouloss plea hearing which was held in secret earlier_this month that the foreign_policy advisers case was a small part of a large-scale ongoing investigation Though Papadopoulos was first arrested in July the court kept his case sealed for months after prosecutors asserted that making it public would significantly undermine his ability to serve as a proactive cooperatorFormer Trump campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort and Rick_Gates his longtime business_partner were charged in a separate 12-count_indictment in connection with their work advising a Russia-friendly political party in Ukraine While their charges do not directly relate to their roles on the Trump campaign legal_analysts said the case could offer a preview of how Mueller plans to proceedAmong many other counts including conspiracy to launder money and failing to file reports of foreign_bank accounts Manafort and Gates were charged with carrying out a conspiracy against the United_States Specifically the special_counsel alleged that they worked to defraud the Justice and Treasury departments as they tried to hide their incomes and lobbying work for Ukrainian interestsMueller could be working to convince Manafort and Gates to cooperate and he could also be trying to send a message to others in Trumps orbit that he will leave no stone unturned and that those who deceive investigators will be charged legal_analysts saidBut Mueller also could be signaling a charge he could pursue in connection with the coordination case a conspiracy to defraud the United_States by coordinating with RussiaCollusion is not a crime but basically the criminal equivalent is conspiracy said former federal_prosecutor Randall Eliason You could have a conspiracy to defraud the US by interfering with our electionMueller must also separate efforts that might seem seedy from those that are illegalAn opposition_research firm funded by Clintons campaign and the DNC tapped a former_British spy to dig into Trumps personal and business_dealings and the former spy purportedly solicited information from Russian_government officials That work might similarly be viewed as an unsavory effort to engage with foreign interests to win an election but it would not necessarily be illegal if there was no conspiracy to defraud anyone legal_analysts saidThere could be something out there that stinks to high

Matthew Continetti and chairman Michael Goldfarb We stand by our reporting and we do not apologize for our methods The Free Beacons lawyers notified the House_Intelligence Committee of its role in the

in our research into Hillary_Clinton Since its inception in 2012 the website has retained third-party firms to conduct research on many individuals and institutions of interest to us and our readers Opposition research is nothing new in political races or the corporate world but it is not a common practice for a news website to hire out such work which is often expensive Firms like Fusion_GPS can charge tens of thousands of dollars for research on a single subject After the Free_Beacon stopped paying Fusion_GPS the research firm offered in April_2016 to continue researching Trump for the

Mostly cloudy showers Highs 57-61A very variable pattern prevails over this forecast period with just a little_bit of everything in store If you like sunny classic autumn weather today is your day as tomorrow shifts back to cooler cloudier conditions with showers We warm more strongly by Thursday and Friday (70s) but clouds and then rain risks increase especially by this weekend with another cool wedge situation A few morning clouds possible but otherwise mostly sunny skies offer a fairly decent day as temperatures move up toward seasonal high temperature levels in the upper 50s to low 60s Light breezes blow from the west HighBundle the kids up appropriately before they head out to trick-or-treat The night becomes partly cloudyand cooler with lows ranging from the middle-upper 30s in the outer suburbs to the middle 40s in the city Light winds mainly from the north HighA cold morning commute Mostly cloudy with a chance of afternoon showers or light rain (especially north and west) as high temperatures only manage to make the cool 50s to around 60 Light winds mainly come from the easterly direction to reinforce a cool wedging pattern Rainfall totals should be really light from just 001 inches to maybe a tenth of an inch Medium-high Some evening showers or light rain but otherwise mostly cloudy with lows ranging through the 40s to around 50 in the city Winds light to calm Medium trends warmer with partly cloudy skies and highs in the upper 60s t0 low 70s runs partly cloudy with lows in the warmer 50s Medium should be our warmest day of the week with lower to middle 70s for highs with partly sunny skies A stray shower chance is possible late in the day is cloudier with scattered showers or light rain as lows dip only into the 50s MediumThe first of November isnt offering up much in the way of nice weather A big high pressure area stalls out over New England and a cool wedge along a stalled front gets established The result is mostly cloudy skies through the weekend with periods of showers light rain and drizzle/mist mess Timing out the periods of precipitation remain more difficult but right_now it seems like may be the window for the most precipitation risks all of it mainly light Highs both days should be in the 50s to around 60 with lows in the 50s too Low-mediumClouds and showers with the cool wedge could linger into as well but we may manage to

freelance_journalist Kim Wall Danish police said Monday marking the latest shift in Madsens explanation for how Walls severed body sank tothe sea floor off the coast of CopenhagenMadsen still maintains he did_not kill Wall according to a police now claiming Wall died of carbon monoxide poisoning inside his submarine while he was on deckAccording to her family Wall 30 was writing a piece about Madsen 46 an amateur rocket builder known in Denmark for using crowdfunding to build submarines and rockets Wall a freelance_journalist who hadSri Lanka the Marshall Islands and North_Korea boarded the submarine on Aug_10 and was reported missingon Aug 11 That day Madsen was pulled from Koge Bay after police say he deliberately sank his submarineMadsen was taken into custody on Aug 12and his trial is expected to begin in MarchSince August Madsens retelling of what led to Walls death has changed repeatedly He is being held in Vestre Prison in Copenhagen and has been charged with manslaughter Madsen told a Danish court that he was showing Wall around his boat when he lost his grip on a 150-pound hatch which then collided with Walls skull He said he panicked and gave Wall what prosecutors called a burial at seaIn the shock I was in it was the right thing to do Madsen according to Agence France-PresseReuters that Madsen said there was a pool of blood where she had landed before he panicked and tossed her lifeless body overboardYet when divers discovered Walls in early October the gruesome details of that burial began to cast doubt on Madsens testimony The Associated_Press reported that Walls severed legs were found in plastic bags weighted with metal while her recovered head showed no signs of fracture like it would have if struck by a hatchAnother bag contained a knife along with Walls clothing A naked torso had been found in the same waters weeks earlier and had been stabbed 15 times according to the APBut even Madsens claim that he gave Wall at burial at sea contradicted what he told police immediately after her disappearance Madsen initially claimed he dropped Wall off on shore in Copenhagen before his submarine a 60-foot UC3 Nautilus sankBut once police pulled the boat up from the sea floor they discovered blood inside Madsen was arrested on a manslaughter charge and accused of scuttling his own ship Authorities matched blood found inside the submarine with DNA from the torso and from Walls toothbrush and hairbrush police said in a news conferenceWhen the torso washed up on shore several days after the submarine was recovered Madsen conceded that Wall had died on board But he claimed it was an accident caused by the falling hatch The charges_against Madsen were then upgraded to murderTwo people are on a boat Her legs and head and arms were cut_off and we can prove that Jakob Buch-Jepsen special prosecutor with the Copenhagen police told The Washington_Post Madsen has told prosecutors that he was interested in sadomasochism and had had sex onboard the Nautilus beforeIn September aSwedish newspaper quoted Madsens defense lawyer as saying Madsen was not quite like other people in his sexual preferences despite his being harmless Madsen still denies having sex with Wall according to Mondays news releaseYet prosecutors said they had discovered videos on Madsens computer of women being tortured and decapitated Buch-Jepsen said he and his colleagues presumed the images to be realMadsen said duringthe pretrial session that the computer hard drive which was found in a laboratory run by Madsen didnt belong to him but instead were part of tools used by everyone in the laboratoryMondays news release said that over the past two_weeks several dives had been carried_out to find Walls arms and cellphone The dives have so_far been unsuccessfulUnlike garden variety yeast infections this one causes serious bloodstream infections spreads easily from person to person in health-care settings and survives for months on skin and for weeks on bed rails chairs and other hospital equipmentSome strains are resistant to all three major classes of antifungal drugs Based on information from a limited number of patients up to 60 percent of people with these infection have died Many of them also had other serious underlying illnessesThose at greatest risk are individuals who have been in intensive care for a long time or who are onventilators or have central line catheters inserted into a large veinIn the United_States the largest number of infections has been reported in New_York with at_least 28 cases according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Infections have also been reported in Illinois Maryland Massachusetts and New_Jersey Last June the CDC sent an urgent alert to clinicians to start looking for the infections which are difficult to identify with standard laboratory methodsAs soon as we put out that alert we started to get information about cases and now we know more about how it spreads and how its acting Tom Chiller the CDCs top fungal expert said in an_interview Thursday The CDC now tracks the updating the case count every few weeksIn addition to the 35 infected patients an additional 18 were carrying the organism but werent sickened by itThe microbe is among a group of newly emerging drug-resistant threats health officials saidThese pathogens are increasing theyre new theyre scary and theyre very difficult to combat said Anne Schuchat CDCs acting director during a briefing in Washington this week about the growing danger fromOf the first seven cases that were last fall four patients had bloodstream infections and died during the weeks to months after the pathogen was identified Officials said they couldnt be sure whether the deaths were caused by the infection because all the individuals had other serious medical conditions Five patients had the fungus initially isolated from blood one from urine and one from the earThe infection is still relatively rare Its really hitting the sickest of the sick Chiller saidSo far the fungus doesnt_seem to be evolving into new strains within the United_States Because the country doesnt yet have any homegrown strains of the deadly fungus it gives us a better opportunity to contain it and stop it from spreading Chiller saidIn other countries infections have been resistant to all three major types of antifungal drugs but so_far the US cases have been treatable with existing drugsBecause invasive bloodstream infections with are common in hospitalized patients in the United_States health officials are concerned that this deadly strain could get into that mix Chiller saidUnlike infections in the mouth throat or vagina (which are typically called yeast infections) invasive yeast infections can affect the blood heart brain eyes bones and other parts of the body and are more dangerousAmong infectious disease clinicians and laboratory personnel infections involving fungi dont typically ring the same kind of alarm bells as until nowThis is a paradigm shift because is not generally thought of as highly resistant or passed person to person Chiller saidSince the CDC issued its alert in June the agency has provided funds and additional expertise to help regional laboratories and hospitals identify the organismKim Jong_Un stood on the stage in front of stylized portraits of his father and grandfather men he wasnt supposed to be strong enough or cunning enoughto succeed lauding the thrilling explosion of the most recent nuclear_test and the leap forward in all sectors of the national economyHis Western-style suit his haircut his glasses even his gravelly voice were all reminiscent of his grandfather Kim_Il Sung the founder and eternal president of North_Korea who to this day is associated with strength and prosperityIn front of him in the huge hall were 3467 delegates called in May to the before Kim_Jong Un was even born Among them were hard-nosed party stalwarts the sort who had been expected by some analysts to turn against the inexperienced upstart when he first rose to the top But there they were men in military uniforms covered to the waist in medals cheering party officials scientists the editor of the party newspaper anti-Japanese revolutionary war veterans field laborersIt was Kims moment It was his way of saying Im in charge here And these were the people who were keeping him in power the North_Korean loyalists who like Kim have a vested interest in keeping the worlds most repressive regime intactTheir supportenabled Kim to celebrate his fifth anniversary as the leader of North_Korea on Saturday propelling the communist monarchy into its 71st yearThe Kim family has ruled the country through fear and favors since the end of World_War II when Kim_Il Sung was chosen by Joseph Stalin to run it as a Soviet client state His son Kim_Jong Il continued the family rule for 17 years until his five_years ago Saturdayat age 69The founders grandson Kim_Jong Un was then anointed as the Great Successor in a country where the Kim family is deified and its supporters live large while the remaining 20-odd million North_Koreans struggle to feed their families and heat their shabby homesDuring the transition plenty of people who make a living studying North_Korea from abroad predicted the systems demise doubtful that a Swiss-educated Chicago Bulls fan with no military background and none of the revolutionary myth of his forebears could retain control of a country run by hard-line octogenariansBut he hasFive years on the Kim regime has not just held together it is relatively strong The economy has been growing if not booming The country has functioning nuclear_weapons and is toward being able to deliver them to the continental United StatesKim has given his closest ally Chinese President_Xi Jinping the cold shoulder and suffered little for it He has threatened to attack the United_States and has actually attacked South_Korea but the sanctions_imposed as punishment have fallen well short of fatalHe has been a good dictator in the sense that he has behaved in accordance with the rules said Bruce Bueno de Mesquita a political_scientist at New_York University who describes how authoritarian leaders around the world retain power in his book Why Bad Behavior Is Almost Always Good PoliticsHe has governed through corruption and rent-seeking and keeping the population miserableAnd theres no reason to expect Kim to be going anywhere soon Bueno de Mesquita said If they survive the first two years most dictators die in their sleepKen Gause a North_Korea leadership expert at CNA a research company in Arlington Va agreed that Kim seems firmly in control at_least for nowYou have a leader who is becoming more comfortable in his own skin and is able to delegate and manipulate the levers of power in a much more sophisticated way Gause said I would say he is still working on building and solidifying his power But for all intents and purposes he is the leader in every sense of the wordFor kleptocratic dictators the world over the key to staying in power is keeping the elite happy and rivals scaredNowhere is this the case more_than in North KoreaKim has retained power by relying on a relatively small_group perhaps a couple of hundred military officials Politburo members and money-makers who also have an interest in keeping him at the helm When he convened the congress in May he put more of his core supporters into positions of power Regimes like this stay intact by spending money on the military and the apparatchiks instead of on the massesHes paying the people who keep him in office enough so they wont defect to anyone_else Bueno de Mesquita said He needs to keep the loyalists loyalAnd for the loyalists of Pyongyang life is the best it has been in decadesThere are new high-rise apartment buildings popping up everywhere although the lower floors are most desired since there isnt enough electricity to power the elevators Theres a pizza restaurant in the city and a German beer hall amusement parks and swimming pools Supermarkets stock Japanese mayonnaise and French wine Taxis are everywhere With money anything is possibleAnd increasingly people have money Once reliant entirely on the state North_Koreans have been increasingly allowed to Factory managers and co-operative farmers have more freedom to innovate as long as they meet their state quotas and private trade in products from television sets to chewing gum is now tolerated A recent study from Seouls Korea Institute for National Unification that the North_Korean government collects between $13million and $17million each day in fees from market tradersA new class of donju or masters of money has emerged in this space between state and private activity using their positions in the regime many travel to the outside_world where they can trade to enrich their leader and themselvesBut while tinkering at the margins Kim has operated very much according to the playbook written by his grandfather He has elevated the standing of the Workers_Party and emphasized economic_development both of which under his father were subordinated to the military and nuclear weaponsThere is no_doubt that the economy is a shadow of what it could be State factories remain stuck in the Soviet era if they are operating at all Tough multilateral and direct sanctions_imposed after nuclear and missile_tests are bitingThose sanctions threaten the foreign-currency earnings that Kim needs to continue underwriting the lifestyles of the North_Korean upper crust and keeping them happyBut the country is still in its best economic shape in decades with growth of about 2 or 3percent according to private-sector analysts much better than in the years of contraction under his fatherIf Kim who turns 33 on Jan 8 maintains the support of North_Koreas top tier he could remain in power for decades to come said Sue Mi Terry a former North_Korea analyst at the CIAThe junior Kim has already ruled for five_years and could conceivably rule for another 50 years she said if he maintains the support of North_Koreas elites the shareholders in his regime But there will be challengesWhile the elites as a group by and large still support him there are signs of growing discord among the ruling class as it struggles for power and influence Terry said noting that there have been several high-profile defections from the regime this yearBut Kim doesnt just use money to curry favor he uses to instill fear Since he took power at_least 100 top-level officials have been purged or executedMost notably he had his own uncle Jang Song Thaek hauled out of a meeting at the end of 2013 broadcast on television and denounced as a traitor for all ages thenThe elites know that if Kim can turn on his uncle and other high-ranking officers like he did any of them could be next in his gun sights Terry saidCheong Seong Chang a leadership expert at the Sejong Institute outside Seoul said the purges are a sign of Kims strengthIf Kim_Jong Uns power base was weak it would have been risky to execute these high-ranking officials he said noting that the younger Kim executed many fewer people than his father did about 2000 during his own transition period These executions show that he has absolute powerFor one of the worlds most threatening figures very little is known about Kim as a personIntelligence from inside the isolated state is notoriously thin and only a handful of outsiders have met him The only Americans to have spent any time with him are Dennis Rodman the former Chicago Bulls basketball player who visited the country three_times and his entourageJoe Terwilliger a New_York geneticist who accompanied Rodman on two of his trips said Kim is very different in person from the outside worlds caricature of himHes charming and gregarious and very friendly He told a lot of jokes and we had open conversations about every imaginable topic like hanging out with old friends said Terwilliger who went jet-skiing with Kim at his summer house and sang karaoke in front of him He especially likes sports music and movies and even asked about Sylvester StalloneSince taking over Kim has cultivated an image as a man of the people Hes gone on rides at one of Pyongyangs new amusement parks Unlike his father who never appeared in public with any of his wives Kim is often accompanied by his fashionable spouseKim and Ri who are believed to have two or three young children have visited Pyongyang residents in their apartments sitting on the floor with them Kim has even poured drinks for his hosts a humble gesture in a culture that prizes seniority and protocolState media shows Kim with a much smaller retinue than his father had and he is tactile often slapping backs and clasping hands a huge smile on his faceExperts have been trying to psychoanalyze North_Koreas leaders for decades but its hard given how few clues there are The popular view is of a nuclear-armed madman but such mockery risks underestimating KimPeople like him are not crazy and they are not erratic said Bueno de Mesquita the NYU political_scientist They are carefully calculatingBut given Kims capacity for brutality his and his apparently impulsive tendencies there is reason to be concerned about his hot-headedness said Jerrold Post a psychiatrist who founded the CIAs personality analysis centerThis is all about big boys and their big toys Post said I must say Im concerned about words leading to actions between him andIndeed Kim has proved quick to escalate tensions as in the summer of 2015 when a confrontation with South_Korea over a land-mine attack brought the two countries to the brink of warThe next two or three years will be critical for Kim analysts say as he solidifies his control and confronts the unconventional Donald Trump administration But if the past is any guide it would be prudent to avoid making predictions about the North_Korean regimes imminent demiseThere has been a lot of wishful thinking going on since the 1990s said Gause of CNA Im not saying that their days are not numbered but North_Korea is a very resilient country You cant go on expecting the Kim family to crumble Yoonjung_Seo contributed to this reportNorth Korea has made no secret of its goal to produce an_intercontinental ballistic_missile capable of hitting the United_States mainland giving it the means to send a nuclear_warhead to its archenemy Kim_Jong Uns rocket scientists are thought to be several years from being able to do this instead concentrating on intermediate-range missiles that can reach only as far as GuamBut now some analysts are asking Did North_Korea just try to launch two long-range missilesWe think it is important that people consider the possibility that this was a KN-08 test said Jeffrey_Lewis director of the East_Asia nonproliferation program at the Middlebury_Institute of International_Studies at Monterey in California referring to the intercontinental_ballistic missile or ICBM by its technical nameNorth Korea conducted two missile_tests earlier_this month on Oct 9 and 19 Both took_place at an air base in Kusong on North_Koreas west coast on the other side of the country from the usual Musudan test_site near Wonsan on the east coastThe United_States Strategic Command said Wednesday that both tests are presumed to be of Musudan missiles and South_Korean military officials have said the same The Musudan is technically capable of flying as far as 2400 miles putting Guam within range and almost reaching AlaskaThese would mark the seventh and eighth Musudan tests this year Only one in June was a success flying about 250miles and reaching a surprisingly high altitude But after poring over satellite photos enhanced with a near infrared band of light Lewis and his fellow experts at MIIS think theres an even chance that the launches were of ICBMsWere not fully persuaded that it was a Musudan Lewis said noting that Strategic Command known as StratCom twice misidentified three missiles that North_Korea launched in SeptemberWe still think people are being too quick to jump to the conclusion that this was a Musudan Even if its only 50/50 being shocked half of the time is still bad he saidLooking at before-and-after satellite imagery from Planet Labs a San Francisco-based imaging company Lewis and his colleagues found burn scars after each missile firing showing where the hot exhaust scorched the pavement and grass Near infrared light can discriminate between burned and untouched parts of vegetationNon-proliferation analysts say that the burn scars suggest a huge explosion(Planet Labs)The first scar is really big That is consistent with a catastrophic failure he said noting that it was possible that the explosion damaged the launch vehicle on which it was mounted The second burn scar is small like the missile flew some distance before whatever went wrongThese big burn scars are much bigger than what had been seen after Musudan tests and the fact that they happened on the other side of the country added to suspicions about the kind of missile being testedOther analysts said it is possible if not probable that the tests were of ICBMsWhile this was most_likely a Musudan test the possibility of a KN-08 cannot be ruled out said John Schilling an aerospace engineer who frequently writes about the Norths missiles Schilling expects North_Koreas road-mobile ICBMs to reach operational status early in the next decade perhaps within five yearsIt seems most_likely that the latest test was an attempt to test the Musudan from an operational launch facility rather_than a test facility he said explaining the difference in test locationAlthough noting that StratCom should be able to distinguish between a Musudan and a much larger ICBM he also pointed out that the US agency had misidentified the three missiles launched last_month StratCom first called them short-range Rodongs then medium-range Musudans They turned_out to be extended-range Scud missilesI do not place high confidence in their ability to distinguish a KN-08 from a Musudan Schilling said And I do not think anyone should have high confidence in their ability to predict North_Korean behavior regarding missile testing Joseph S Bermudez Jr chief analytics officer at AllSource Analysis a Denver-based consultancy also said the likelihood was that the missiles were medium-range MusudansGiven their concentration on perfecting the Musudan I would think they were testing a Musudan he said saying that the test_site could have been moved simply to make it harder for intelligence_agencies to monitor the activityAlthough all but one Musudan test has failed North_Korea has shown rapid advances with its missile program this year It successfully launched a ballistic_missile from a submarine in August and launched what it said was a satellite in February That launch was widely considered a cover for an ICBM testJapans Asahi television network citing an unnamed North_Korean military source reported earlier_this month that Kim had ordered ICBM development to be finished by the end of this year A spokesman for North_Koreas space agency last_week pledged that the state would continue working on its peaceful satellite programRegardless of whether this latest test was of medium- or long-range missiles analysts agree that they are cause for concernWhats more concerning is not an individual test or two individual tests its that theyre approaching their missile development in a very pragmatic way Bermudez saidWhat theyre doing is exactly right They are testing and they are testing often he said This is the way you really learn how to develop a ballistic_missile and thats what worries me In the United_States there is growing recognition of the increased threat posed by North KoreaJames R_Clapper Jr the director of national intelligence said Tuesday that the United_States had to assume that North_Korea would be able to mount a nuclear_warhead on a missile_capable of reaching the West Coast of the United StatesWe ascribe to them the capability to launch a missile that would have a weapon on it to reach parts of the United_States certainly including Alaska and Hawaii he said in a discussion at the Council on Foreign RelationsThey could do it We have to make the worst-case assumption here he saidClapper also said that trying to persuade North_Korea to give up its weapons was now probably a lost cause given that the program was its ticket to survivalEarlier this month Jami Miscik previously a top analyst at the CIA warned against underestimating North_Koreas capabilitiesThe fact these rocket launches are failing shouldnt give anyone comfort she said at Fortunes Most Powerful Women summit according to the magazine They fail and they fix that thing and it might fail for another reason but theyre advancing in terms of their capabilityTOKYO How do you solve a problem like North_Korea Its a problem that has befuddled American presidents for decadesWell Donald Trump has a new idea In the first debate Monday_night the Republican candidate appeared to suggest that China should invade North KoreaYou look at North_Korea were doing nothing there Trump said when asked about his policy on nuclear_weapons during the debate China should solve that problem for us China should go into North_Korea China is totally powerful as it relates to North_Korea China responded within hours toTrumps suggestion by saying it has been making unremitting efforts with all sides concerned to resolve the nuclear issue according to Foreign_Ministry spokesman_Geng Shuang on TuesdayThe idea that China once North_Koreas patron now the closest thing it has to a friend (and its not that close) has leverage_over North_Korea is not newPyongyangs nuclear_tests are routinely met with condemnation then sanctions through the United_Nations that are aimed_at cutting off the regimes ability to get parts for its weapons_program or earn the money needed to finance it After this months nuclear_test there were many calls for China to get serious about imposing international sanctions on the North The sanctions are not effective unless Beijing fully implements them cracking down on the Chinese intermediaries that do business with North KoreaBeijing has become increasingly angry during the reign of North_Korean leader_Kim Jong_Un and has supported increasingly stringent sanctions but analysts say its ultimate consideration has not changed It does_not want the regime to collapse sending millions of hungry North_Koreans into China and potentially the 28000 American troops stationed in South_Korea right up to its borderBut Trumps suggestion that China go into North_Korea took the exhortations for Beijing to act to a whole new level and is a bit of contrast to his own suggestions over the summerRemember that back in June Trump suggested he would deal with North_Korea by to Washington but not for a state dinner just for hamburgers around a conference tableOn Twitter there was widespread disbelief at the idea that a military invasion was the answerDonald Trump just encouraged China to invade North_Korea Terry Canales (@TerryCanales40) Indeed analysts poured cold water on the very idea that leaning on China was a new strategyHas the Bush administration not tried to use Chinese leverage to control Pyongyang Has not the Obama_administration Eom Sang-yoon a research fellow at the Sejong Institute What Trump is saying is very basic so_far he has not provided any details on how his policy will be different from that of Obama Sang-yoon saidBut the Republican candidate did_not just stop at China He criticized the Obama_administrations nuclear agreement with Iran as the worst deal I_think Ive ever seen negotiatedCracking down on North_Korea should have been made part of that deal Trump saidIran is one of their biggest trading partners Iran has power over North_Korea Trump said When they made that horrible deal with Iran they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North KoreaThat claim had Iran experts scratching their headsTrump has power over North KoreaKhamenei will wake up finding himself ruling half the world Ariane M Tabatabai (@ArianeTabatabai) Trump also took the opportunity to again insist that Japan and South_Korea both American allies should be paying more for their defenseJust to go down the list we defend Japan we defend Germany we defend South_Korea we defend Saudi_Arabia we defend countries They do not pay us he saidBut they should be paying us because we are providing tremendous service and were losing a fortune saying that we are losing billions and billions of dollars This isnt 40_years ago where we could do what were doing We cant defend Japan a behemoth selling us cars by the million he saidIn fact these countries do pay for their own defense Japan pays almost $2_billion a year to host American troops on its soil while South_Korea pays about $850 million annually We wrote about the costs and benefits of the two alliances earlier_this year This is how one former Republican spokesman on the Hill respondedKorea actually pays hundreds of millions of dollars a year for our military Trump knows that Still lied Brian Walsh (@brianjameswalsh) In Seoul the government broke with normal diplomatic protocol to rebut Trumps remarksOur government normally considers it inappropriate to comment on remarks by a particular [American] presidential_candidate Cho June-hyuck spokesman at the Foreign_Ministry said at a press briefingNevertheless I can say that our government has contributed to and played a role in maintaining and strengthening the combined defense capability of South_Korea and the US as well as stably stationing US Forces Korea here the spokesman said according to a report from the Yonhap_News AgencyMondaymorning Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) a liberal government watchdog organization joined with several prominent law professors to against President Trump alleging that he is in violation of the emoluments_clause (aka the foreign emoluments clause) of the Constitution The suit filed in the Southern_District of New_York seeks a declaratory judgmenton the meaning and application of the clause a ruling that Trump has violated the clause and an injunction prohibiting further violations Those joining CREW in the suit include Harvards Laurence Tribe UC Irvines Erwin Chemerinsky and Fordham Universitys Zephyr Teachout The complaint is One problem for the litigants is that there is virtually no precedent on the and scholars disagree on and even Historical practice provides some guide but its not dispositive There have been a from the Office of Legal Counsel over the years but they are not entirely consistent with one another While we can of the clause suggested by some commentators real questions remain about which of the presidents extensive business relationships and interests could give rise to emolument clause violations and under what circumstances (And even if the president is not violating the emoluments_clause there are still plenty of reasons to be concerned that his investments create other conflicts of interest and that he should do more to extricate himself from such conflicts but thats a subject for another time This post is focusing on the legal issues)CREW faces a bigger problem than trying to convince a federal court that Trump is violating the Constitution It will first have convince the court that it is entitled to litigate this question at all In order to maintain a suit in federal court a plaintiff must show that the requirements of Article III standing are satisfied In this case CREWs arguments for standing are a stretch In short CREW will have a hard time showing that it has suffered a cognizable injury from Trumps alleged violation of the emoluments_clause an injury that is both actual or imminent as well as concrete and particularized to CREW let alone that such injury was caused by Trumps conduct and that it is redressable by a favorable court judgmentThe core of CREWs argument for standing is that Trumps violations of the emoluments_clause have injured CREW because as an organization dedicated to policing government ethics and misconductthese violations give it more work to do and divert resources from other issuesFrom the complaintCREW brings this action to stop and prevent the violations of the Foreign Emoluments Clause that Defendant Donald_J Trump has committed and will commit which have already injuredand without a remediable order from this Court will_continue to injureCREW in the form of a significant diversion and depletion of its time resources and efforts CREW has standing under 455 US 363 379 (1982) because there has been a concrete and demonstrable injury to the organizations activities[] with the consequent drain on the organizations resources 6 F3d 898 904-05 (2d Cir 1993)For those familiar_with standing law this may seem like an odd argument because if it were accepted in such broad terms it would make standing a non-issue for advocacy organizations of all stripes Environmental organizations for example would be able to assert standing for any and all alleged violations of federal environmental laws on the grounds that such violations injure those groups by forcing them to divert resources to police those violations Instead as anyone remotely familiar_with recent standing jurisprudence knows environmental groups often have to go to significant lengths to demonstrate standing lest they be thrown out of court as has happened in cases such asandSimilarly if standing were as easy to establish as CREW suggests we would have expected a different outcome in other cases such as as wellCREWs standing claim is based upon thecase cited above In that case the Supreme_Court heldthat a local non-profit Housing Opportunities Made Equal (HOME) had standing to challenge violations of the Fair Housing Act because such violations frustrated HOMEs purpose Specifically HOME operated counseling and referral services to help individuals find homes and advance the cause of increasing housing opportunity and argued that unlawful housing discrimination made it more difficult and costly to perform those functions CREW on the other hand alleges something quite different Whereas HOME had to spend more resources because unlawful discrimination made it more difficult to find homes for those it served CREW claims it has to spend more resources answering press inquiries explaining the emoluments_clause to policymakers and the public and hiring an additional attorney so CREW may more effectively counteract Trumps ethical and legal violations In other_words CREWs argument is that its injury is having to spend money to file this lawsuit and raise awareness about the issues it presents HOME in the courts words could allege injuries that were far more_than simply a setback to the organizations abstract social interests CREW Not so muchAnother important distinction betweenand is that the latter concerneda statute with provisions expressly authorizing private suits to enforce its requirements With this provision Congress made clear it wanted to do as much as possible to facilitate more stringent enforcement of the FHAs terms through private litigation a point Justice Brennan stressed in his opinion for the court Yet there is nothing in the emoluments clausenor in any federal legislation creating a cause of action to enforce the provisions terms let alone the sort of explicit cause of action contained in the FHA This matters because as the court has stressed time and again Congress may create procedural rights that ease the standing burden Without such a statutorily created right however CREWs burden becomes that much greaterThere are other differences between and Josh Blackman identifies some such as the fact that HOME sought money damages a form of relief that would clearly redress their alleged injury whereas CREW does_not He also notes that Justice Ginsburg cited toquite a bit in but that Ginsburg was also writing in dissentPerhaps aware of the standing problem facing this suit CREW decided to file its action in New_York within the jurisdiction of the US Court of Appeals for the 2ndCircuit rather_than in DC This is likely because in the 2nd Circuit adopted a somewhat more expansive interpretation ofthan have other circuits including the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Yet evendoes not go as far as CREW needs to sustain this suit as the plaintiff organization there raised claims much closer to those of HOME in than CREW does hereStanding is not the only jurisdictional obstacle to CREWs suit even if it is the most substantial Another potential barrier is the Political Question doctrine which further limits the power of the federal courts I will address this doctrine and explain how it might apply to in a follow-up postTRUMP So its been 235 days since crooked Hillary_Clinton has had a press conference And you as reporters who give her all of these glowing reports should ask yourselves why And Ill tell_you why Because despite the nice platitudes shes been a messYou look at whats_happened with ISIS which isnt even mentioned You look at whats_happening with law and order they dont even mention our police They mention everybody but our police They dont have an American flag on the dais until we started complaining and then they ran up with two very small little flags one that we sawSo you know I put myself through your news_conferences often not that its fun 235 days no news_conference for Hillary_Clinton You oughta check it out because theres a lot going onHer great disloyalty to the person that rigged the system for her Debbie_Wasserman Schultz she totally rigged it Bernie_Sanders never had a chanceAnd total disloyalty its like youre fired get out fast The e-mail situation I call it the double e-mail situation both very serious What was said in the last ones to the DNC was horrible absolutely horribleIf I wouldve used language like they used about religion about race about everything else that they discuss in those e-mails I wouldve had to run and hide and probably drop out of the raceWith her everythings just fine So just ask yourself why she doesnt have news_conferences And honestly the reason is because theres no way she can answer_questions because the job she has done is so badWhen they talk about change I noticed they have change Shes been there for 30_years Thirty years Theres_no change Its going to be the same its going to be an extension of Obama In my opinion worse She lied about TPP She was for TPP she saw me on television knocking the hell out of it because its a horror show its going to kill all our jobs its going to be almost as bad as NAFTA maybe worse which her_husband signed by the way which destroyed this country destroyed manufacturing in the United StatesAnd Ill do something about it thatll be so renegotiated And by the way yesterday for the first time she said she wants to renegotiate trade agreements First time yesterday Well because of meShe also saw me talking_about TPP and currency manipulation and currency devaluation And she heard it and she said wow she cant win that subject in a debateSo all of a sudden she goes and she goes against TPP her vice_president is one of the biggest proponents of TPP and now hes going against it And Bernie_Sanders was right he was against itThey will go for TPP and vote it in very shortly_after the election if she wins which for the sake of our_country we all hope and I_hope that she doesnt They will vote it in -- just mark my words hopefully we dont have to worry about it -- but she will voteShell change a comma shell change a paragraph of the 6000 page document that nobodys even read on our side Just so you understand the other countries know every word every paragraph every sentence every single comma and periodWe dont even read it our_country Because were led by stupid people so she saw me talking_about TPP she realized that she couldnt defend it her special interests are pushing her hard because shes bought and sold by the special interestsTheyre pushing her very hard and so she said shes against it The day she gets in -- which hopefully will never happen -- she will approve or shortly thereafter TPP And that will be another disaster for job in our_country OKSo why dont we start off any questions Yes sirQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Its just a total deflection this whole thing with Russia In fact I saw her campaign_manager I dont_know his title Mook I saw him on television and they asked him about Russia and the hackingBy the way they hacked -- they probably have her 33000 e-mails I_hope they do They probably have her 33000 e-mails that she lost and deleted because youd see some beauties there So lets seeBut I watched this guy Mook and he talked about we think it was Russia that hacked Now first of all was what was said on those thats so bad but he said I watched it I_think he was live But he said we think it was Russia that hackedAnd then he said -- and this is in person sitting and watching television as Ive been doing -- and then he said could be Trump yeah yeah Trump Trump oh yeah Trump He reminded me of John Lovitz for Saturday Night Live in the liar (ph) where hed go yes yes I went to Harvard Harvard yes yes This is the guy you have to see it Yes it could be Trump yes yes So it is so farfetched Its so ridiculous Honestly I wish I had that power Id love to have that power but Russia has no respect for our countryAnd thats why -- if it is Russia nobody even knows this its probably China or it could be somebody sitting in his bed But it shows how weak we are it shows how disrespected we are Total -- assuming its Russia or China or one of the major countries and competitors its a total sign of disrespect for our_country Putin and the leaders throughout the world have no respect for our_country anymore and they certainly have no respect for our leader So I know nothing about it Its one of the most farfetched Ive ever heard Yes Jon (ph)QUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I never_met Putin I dont_know who Putin is He said one nice thing about me He said Im a genius I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it I never_met PutinQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I would treat Vladimir_Putin firmly but theres nothing that I can think of that Id rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right_now so that we can go and knock out ISIS together with other people and with other countries Wouldnt it be nice if we actually got along with people wouldnt it be nice if we actually got along as an example with Russia Im all for it and lets go get ISIS because we have to get ISIS and we have to get them fastYou saw what_happened with the priest its only going to get worse And Hillary_Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more people from that region into our_country and we have no idea who they are where they come from where their documentation is its only going to get worse and its going to start getting bad in our_country Were letting people come in by the tens of thousands You see what_happened to the French priest A friend of mine he said he was going to France like three four months_ago I saw him yesterday I said howd you like France He said I wouldnt go to France I wouldnt go to France Because France is no_longer France France is no_longer France They wont like me for saying that but you see what_happened in Nice you see what_happened yesterday with the priest who was supposed to be a spectacular man France is no_longer France and this world better be very careful and they better get very tough and very smart and theyll never do it with Hillary ClintonAnd by the way in terms of change shes been there for 30_years Shes been doing this for 30_years What shes going to go all of sudden things are going to change Shes bought and sold 100_percent by special interests and lobbyists Yes Tom (ph)QUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP None noneQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Because its under order And Ill release them when the audits completed Nobody would release when its under -- Ive had audits for 15 or 16 years Every year I have a routine audit Im under_audit when the audits complete Ill release them But zero I mean I will tell_you right_now zero I have nothing to do with Russia yesQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I dont_know I dont_know It depends on the audit It depends on the audit not a big deal By the way just so you understand Ive released my papers 104 pages of documents I built an unbelievable company tremendous cash tremendous company with some of the great assets of the world Youve seen it You were all very disappointed when you saw it actually but thats OK Far far great than anybody ever thought I have a great company I built an unbelievable company but if you look there youll see theres nothing in RussiaAnd as far as the tax_returns as soon as the audits complete like any lawyer would tell_you Greta Van Susteren she was going over it a while ago shes a lawyer She said well no lawyer would let somebody release a tax return when theyre under_audit Its a routine audit Ive gone through audits which I_think is very unfair for 15 years I have friends that are very rich and never get audited Im audited every year Maybe thats because of politics who knowsQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Im not going to tell Putin what to do Why should I tell Putin what to do He already did something today where he said dont blame them essentially for your incompetence Let_me tell_you its not even about Russia or China or whoever it is thats doing the hacking It was about the things that were said in those e-mails They were terrible things talking_about Jewish talking_about race talking_about atheist trying to pin labels on people -- what was said was a disgrace and it was Debbie_Wasserman Schultz and believe me as sure as youre sitting there Hillary_Clinton knew about it She knew everything Debbie_Wasserman Schultz could not breathe without speaking and getting approval from Hillary_Clinton Couldnt breathe And you saw that It also showed that it was a fixed race but Ive been saying that long before I saw the e-mails It was a rigged race It was totally rigged And Debbie_Wasserman Schultz rigged it for Hillary_Clinton and the sad part is Bernie_Sanders has to use an old word that I use on occasion hes lost his energy He wants to go home and go to sleep But hes got a lot of people that walked out last night Now hundreds of people walked out of the Democrat Convention last night I didnt even hear about it Nobody showed it I didnt see it on television You people dont talk about itThe Republican Convention was incredible I hear I had one of the biggest bounces in decades Like some people are saying nine points In fact a poll just came out ten minutes ago Los Angeles Times Trump 47 Clinton 40 And the reason is that people are sick and tired of Hillary ClintonQUESTION (inaudible) Putin (ph) say stay out Why not say thatTRUMP Why do I have to (ph) get involved with Putin I have nothing to do with Putin Ive never spoken to him I dont_know anything about him other than he will respect me He doesnt respect our president And if it is Russia -- which its probably not nobody knows who it is -- but if it is Russia its really bad for a different reason because it shows how little respect they have for our_country when they would hack into a major party and get everything But it would be interesting to see -- I will tell_you this -- Russia if youre listening I_hope youre able to find the 30000 e-mails that are missing I_think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press Lets see if that happens Thatll be next Yes sirQUESTION (inaudible) this audience and make (ph) your campaign -- what exactly do you believe should happen to minimum_wage in this country (inaudible)OK Sure Two big questions The minimum_wage has to go up People are -- at_least $10 but it has to go up But I_think that states -- federal -- I_think that states should really call the shot As an example I live in New_York Its very expensive in New_York You cant buy a hot dog for the money youre talking_about You go to other states and its not expensive at all Now what it does is puts New_York at a disadvantage if the minimum_wage is up companies move out and things bad things happen At the same_time people have to be taken care of But what Im really going to do on the minimum_wage -- but it has to go upNow Bernie_Sanders lied Bernie_Sanders said in his speech the other day that Donald Trump wants the minimum_wage to go below $7 I said where did he come up with that one That one is just like Joe Biden lied today He said that Donald Trump wants to carpet_bomb -- he was on television -- he said Donald Trump wants to carpet_bomb the enemy in the Middle_East Now that was Ted_Cruz that said that That was not Donald Trump I mean hes not a very bright guy but that was Ted_Cruz that said it And he said it with such surety -- Donald Trump wants to carpet_bomb -- I never said I wanted to carpet_bomb That was Ted_Cruz You remember Ted_Cruz said it You will confirm that I_think Go aheadSo I would like to raise it to at_least $10 and what Im_going to do is Im_going to bring jobs back to this country so that people can start working again so that the $10 and the $15 and the numbers youre talking_about are going to -- literally theyre_going to be peanuts compared to what people can make in the country because Im_going to bring jobs back from Mexico which is booming booming I have a friend who builds plants and hes a great builder of plants and I was with him the other day -- great guy He builds massive plants for automobiles for computers for anything Thats what he does I_think hes the biggest but certainly one of the biggestAnd I said hows it going He said unbelievable Oh good thats good news The countrys doing well No the countrys not doing well but Mexico is unbelievable The plants Im building in Mexico Ive never seen anything -- its the eighth wonder of the world And hes not happy Hes an American guy Hed rather build them here But he said its unbelievable Thats whats_happened to our_country Because we have leadership that doesnt know what theyre doingQUESTION (inaudible) special extreme vettingTRUMP Yes were going to be listing yeah were going to be giving a list of those territories And if you come from those territories we have extreme vetting And were going to have extreme vetting anyway Look we have people coming into this country who have very evil intentions And we have people whether in San Bernardino or whether its the World Trade Center or whether its a lot of other things and you look all over the world and you see whats happeningYou look at Orlando how bad was that And that was horrible That was going after the gay community it looks like We cant let this happen We cannot let this happen We cannot let people come inNow Hillary_Clinton likes to up it Her running mate Tim Kaine who by the way did a terrible job in New_Jersey First act he did in New_Jersey was ask for a $4 billion tax increase and hes not very popular in New_Jersey And he still isnt WhatI mean Virginia The first thing he did the first thing that Tim Kaine did he asked for a $4 billion tax increase And hes not very popular So let me just tell_you and I went all over Virginia and I was there the other day And I thought hed be popular Hes not popular because he asked for tax increases Big tax increases in Virginia Big And also the unemployment went up I_think it doubled or close to doubled during his tenureBut what he wanted to do is very strongly and hes on record he wanted to have even more of the people from that region of the world come in than Hillary_Clinton wants And its unacceptable OK Yes (inaudible)QUESTION Shortly ago prosecutors in Baltimore announced they were dropping all the chargesTRUMP I saw thatQUESTION Against police involved in the Freddie Gray caseTRUMP RightQUESTION Your reaction (inaudible)TRUMP I do have a reaction to the prosecutor in Baltimore who indicted those police officers I do I_think she ought to prosecute herself OK Thats my reaction I_think it was disgraceful what she did and the way she did it And the news_conference that she had where they were guilty before anybody even knew the factsAnd I give a lot of respect and a lot of credit to those police officers who probably could have made a deal I give a lot of respect a lot of credit that they stuck it out And you had victory after victory after victory And she had no chance dont forget she prosecuted the best case what she thought was her best cases first She should prosecute herself She should be held accountableQUESTION (inaudible) to Americans who feel like this was kind of a railroad case Freddie Gray is now a cause celebreTRUMP Well that was a bad case to prove it That was a bad case I mean if youre going to do that its OK because you have to you know there are times when police officers behave very badly But you have to get the right time This was not one of those times And I_think that she is a disgrace to the world of prosecutors for what she did Yes maamQUESTION So as youve gotten to know Governor Pence what surprises you most about himTRUMP YeahQUESTION And (inaudible)TRUMP I have a great relationship with Governor Pence We spent the last three days together He was absolutely my first choice and I never wavered despite the press The press was saying and it was interesting I spoke to him at 1105 him and his wife and I told him that I was going to be choosing them if Id be lucky enough for him to accept And he accepted And that was it For me that was itBut right around that time you had the attack in Nice And I was going to have a news_conference either the following morning or the next_day And of course I had to delay the news_conference because there was attack a horrible attack horrible In France And I delayed the news_conference and everyone said oh hes having second thoughts I never had a second thought in my_life It was such a lie I mean so many lies in the press But it was such a lie And he has been so great Honestly hes been even better than I thought OK BetterQUESTION Do_you think the Geneva Convention are out of dateTRUMP I_think everythings is out of date We have a whole new world When I said that NATO to Wolf Blitzer is obsolete I got attacked Three days later people that study NATO said you know Trump is right You_know what We have a lot of things that are out date because theyre 20 and 30 and 40_years oldNATO you know this isnt a country from 40_years ago Today we have a different threat We have a terror threat And we have an ISIS threat And by the way ISIS isnt even mentioned Its not even mentioned during the Democratic Convention And everyones talking_about it The reason they cant mention it is because they grew itGo aheadQUESTION What would you renegotiate the enhanced interrogation aspect of it TheTRUMP I would -- Katy I would renegotiate so much of everything Im_going to renegotiate our trade deals where were losing with everybody Katy Im_going to renegotiate our military deals where were protecting countries and theyre not living up to the bargain Theyre not living up to the bargain And everyone agrees with me except for the mediaAnd the media never says that I like NATO just so you understand I like NATO I like the concept of NATO It is somewhat outdated because it doesnt cover terror the way it should Ive been saying this for six_months now A couple of months_ago front page Wall_Street Journal We are going to cover terror they announced (ph) somebodyI think NATOs great But its got to be modernized And -- and countries that were protecting have to pay what theyre supposed to be payingQUESTION On the Geneva Convention (inaudible)TRUMP YesQUESTION Do_you think that they should allow for that given the (inaudible)TRUMP I am a person that believes in enhanced interrogation yesAnd by the way it worksQUESTION (inaudible) will you defend the Baltic states if theyre invaded by Russia According toTRUMP Ill tell_you what Let_me say it once_again Let_me say it once_again OK Many countries including the NATO countries some of which I_think you have five that are current that have paid what they owe And they can afford to pay this Its not like they cant afford itThey just see us as a soft touch You_know in business we say somebodys a soft touch I dont_know if Ive been called a soft touch but maybe I have sometimes But in business they call them a soft touch They havent paid us OK I want them to payExcuse me Im not saying anything I dont talk Im not like Obama where he tells you everything hes going to do -- were going to go and do this were going to go and do that I dont talk But theyre_going to payNo no -- yeah it sends a signal You_know what signal it says It says were going to payYou know somebody said but we have treaties I said thats right And in the treaties theyre supposed to pay Theyre going to pay And they will pay They will pay(CROSSTALK)TRUMP YesQUESTION (inaudible) how are you planning to (inaudible)TRUMP Were_going

ClintonTRUMP I dont_think he respects Clinton I dont_think Putin has any respect whatsoever for Clinton I_think he does respect me And I_hope I get along great with him Its possible that we wont Jeremy I_hope that we get along great with Putin because it would be great to have Russia with a good relationshipRight now we dont have a good relationship Putin has said things over the last_year that are really bad things OK He mentioned the N word one time I was shocked to hear him mention the N word You_know what the N word is right He mentioned it I was shockedHe has a total lack of respect for President Obama Number one he doesnt like him And number two he doesnt respect him I_think hes going to respect your president if Im elected And I_hope he likes meYes Yes sirQUESTION

position(CROSSTALK)TRUMP No wait a minute(CROSSTALK)TRUMP No Im not going to be an adversary No not at all I have tenants from China I have the biggest bank in the world from China paying me rent I

China can get away with trade deficits every year of hundreds of billions of dollars -- if they can get away with that my hats off to themI have no problem with China I have a problem with our incompetent leadership allowing that to happen And I believe that Hillary_Clinton is even more bought and paid for than Barack_Obama I_think it will get worseIts going to be four more years of Obama which is unacceptable to a lot of people you see that But I believe that Hillary_Clinton will be worse than ObamaYesQUESTION (OFF-MIKE) you mentioned that you wanted to make college education more affordableTRUMP Thats rightQUESTION Working on a planTRUMP Thats right Im_going to be doing something over the next four weeks very much soQUESTION Are you prepared to give us any sort ofTRUMP No Im prepared to say were gonna have a great plan One of the things I_think because Ive traveled all over the country and Im_going -- you know where Im_going I_guess you all know I dont have to sayBut Im_going to Toledo (ph) and Im_going to different places today and Ive met so many people This is such a great country these are such great people one of the saddest things I see are college students that work so hard that go to colleges good colleges theyre good students they do a great jobNumber one they get out they have no jobs Because our jobs are going to Mexico theyre_going to China theyre_going to Japan theyre_going all over the place Theyre not coming here Just like my friend who builds the plants but he doesnt build them here muchAnd the saddest thing I see is these students are leveraged debt up to their -- up to their neck They cant breathe theyre scared theyre so scared they have leveraged their entire life They have loansAnd I have to tell_you the colleges are viewing the students as just a con to it Because the students get government money passes through but the number gets higher and higherBecause college costs are out of control because the colleges say what difference does it make If you take a look at the salaries being paid you take a look at whats_going on with the collegesBecause all of this is a pass through and the students are a con to it So the colleges are costing so much money We are going to help the students Maybe that doesnt fit beautifully within the Republican frameworkBut I told this during various times to lots of different people and nobody has a problem with it We have to help our students Our students are under tremendous pressure to a point where its making them sickOur students are under tremendous pressure we have to help our students And Im_going to have a plan over the next four weeks(CROSSTALK)QUESTION (OFF-MIKE) talking_about possiblyTRUMP Everythings on the table youll see Everything -- its a very important -- its a very important subjectYes maamQUESTION Mr Trump (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I_think my message is resonating because they have confidence on me at the border if they dont_want people pouring into our_country Likewise they have confidence with me on ISIS not only in terms of getting rid of them but also in terms of keeping them out of our_country because I will not have people come into our_country who want to do damage to our peopleI think they have a lot of confidence in terms of my bringing back jobs because I see Carrier and I see Ford and I see all of these companies leaving and going to Mexico like theres nothing to it And then they make their product they sell it back to the United_States no tax no nothing we get nothing except unemploymentAnd I_think people see that I can tell_you I mean Im like a pollster myself when Im in front of these massive audiences one of the things that gets constantly -- you people know because youre there -- the biggest applause is a repeal and replacement of ObamacareBecause Obamacare is a disaster In Texas going through BlueCross/BlueShield they just announced a 60 percent increase On November 1st youre going to have new numbers come out for Obamacare having to do with increases President Obama is trying to get it moved to December Because it is election-defying It is going to be a massive number the biggest number ever in our countrys history for health_care Its going to be announced on November 1stI just asked the press dont let him do that Obamacare is a disaster people are dying with it Its a disaster and everybody knows and its going to fold anywayIn 17 unfortunately -- if Im president -- I mean Ive got to take over this mess Its going to fold anyway But repeal and replace Obamacare people like itThey like the fact that Im_going to protect the Second Amendment they like the fact that Im_going to rebuild our military which is very depleted Those are the things that are resonatingAnd they dont feel Hillary_Clinton can do itJohn (ph) go ahead John (ph)QUESTION (OFF-MIKE) Russia has no business in you -- that you dont have anyTRUMP No I have nothing to do with Russia John (ph) How many times do I have say that Are you a smart man I have nothing to with Russia I have nothing to do with RussiaAnd even -- for anything What do I have to do with Russia You_know the closest I came to Russia I bought a house a number of years_ago in Palm_Beach FloridaPalm Beach is a very expensive place There was a man who went bankrupt and I bought the house for $40 million and I sold it to a Russian for $100 million including brokerage commissions So I sold it So I bought it for 40 I told it for 100 to a Russian That was a number of years_ago I_guess probably I sell condos to Russians OKQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Of_course I can I told you other than normal stuff -- I buy a house if I sold it to a Russian I have nothing to do with Russia I said that Putin has much better leadership qualities than Obama but who doesnt know thatQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Of_course not I own the Trump organization Zero zero Go_aheadQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I amQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I didQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I did Because I would love to see a woman become president of the United_States But she would be so wrong And even women say that Women dont like her She would be so wrong Look Hillary_Clinton is a disaster Shes been a disaster And even the story told by her_husband last night he left out the most interesting chapter I wont get into thatThe chapter that I really waited for because it was pretty boring the chapter that I waited for I never heard And he left it out Look Hillary_Clintons a disaster Id love to see a woman become president and itll happen absolutely But I_think it would be bad for women if it were Hillary_Clinton Yes maam (ph)QUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Yes I doQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP But I have spoken to about many times and I speak about it all the time and the police have to be very careful they have to be very very well trained I speak about it all the time in fact I mentioned the most recent death excuse me I mentioned the most recent deaths in Louisiana and in Minnesota I speak about it all the time Its a real problem because if the police do 100000 great jobs and they have one either a rogue policeman or a cop who was poorly trained or did a bad job you see that incident on television for weeks Its a real problemYou dont see the good work that they do but if they make one mistake out of 100000 out of more_than that its on television night after night after night The police in this country do an amazing job but likewise I agree and I do mention that all the time Yes maam go_aheadQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Oh go ahead go_aheadQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP YesQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP No but they seem to be if its Russians I have no idea Its probably not Russia Nobody knows if its Russia You_know the sad thing is That with the technology and the genius we have in this country not in government unfortunately but with the genius we have in government we dont even know who took the Democratic_National Committee e-mails We dont even know who it isI heard this morning one report said they dont_think its Russia they think it might be China Another report said it might be just a hacker some guy with a 200 IQ that cant get up in the morning OK Nobody knows Honestly they have no idea if its Russia Might be Russia But if its any foreign country it shows how little respect they have for the United_States Yes maamQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP YesQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Well and (ph) the biggest thing is number one we have to stop by keeping people out because these people theyve got something bad going on up there Thats something really bad going on And then people in terms of Islam and radical Islamic terrorism a term that our president refuses to use I cant hes still not using it Hes still not using it And she doesnt want to use it other than I forced her into maybe using it She said she will use it but so_far she didntShell probably use it tonight Like the American flags as soon as we put out a thing they ran a couple of American flags up in the stage it was a disgrace You had a room with a massive stage without flags I_think this -- I_think that the people in the community know whats_going on Whether its in a mosque or whether its in the community and they have to report these people When you look at San Bernardino people knew -- many people knew what was going on They had bombs lying all over the floor They had bombs on the floor I mean this isnt -- you walk into somebodys house there are bombs lying on the floor -- I_think theres a problem there You got to report itAnd by the way David Hinckley should not have been freed OK David Hinckley was just released -- John Hinckley -- I_think that John Hinckley -- excuse me John Hinckley should not have been freed I just heard about it(CROSSTALK)QUESTION Do_you have any pause (ph) about asking a foreign government -- Russia China anybody -- to interfere to hack into the system of anybodys in this countryTRUMP Thats up to the President Let the President talk to them Look heres the problem Heres the problem Katy (ph) Katy heres the problem very simple He has no respectQUESTION (inaudible) 30000 e-mailsTRUMP Well they probably have them Id like to have them releasedQUESTION Does that not give you pauseTRUMP No it gives_me no pause If they have them they have them We might as well -- hey you know what gives_me more pause That a person in our government crooked Hillary_Clinton -- heres what gives_me pause Be quiet I know you want to save her That a person in our government Katy would delete or get rid of 33000 e- mails That gives_me a big problem After she gets a subpoena She gets subpoenaed and she gets rid of 33000 e-mails That gives_me a problem (ph) Now if Russia or China or any other country has those e-mails I mean to be honest with you Id love to see them(CROSSTALK)QUESTION A question about Mike_Pence because The New_York Times reported that (inaudible) conversation with John Kasichs campaign (inaudible) says you can be the most_powerful (inaudible)TRUMP Thats the most ridiculous conversation He never had the -- Don Jr told me -- let me just tell_you Let_me save you a lot of boredomQUESTION (inaudible) Mike Pences role as vice_president if you are electedTRUMP Mike_Pence will play a big role but I just want to tell_you about John Kasich I never spoke to him about being vice_president We dont have good chemistry together I have never spoken to him about being vice_president I would never pick him to be vice_president There was never a conversation and he has a habit of doing things like this where he says things that may be a little_bit shaky He never spoke -- Don Jr would never -- and that was so long ago I didnt even know I was going to get the nomination at that point Just so you understand I would not have picked John Kasich wouldnt be the right guy I mean for that to have gotten out that was so ridiculous And then I was going to put him in charge of national and worldwide policy So whats left for the president I_think you know me better than that That was put out by him Hes a nice man John Kasich hes fine Hes fine I would never have chosen himNow I did speak to various people and I actually got acceptances from many people There are some people that called me that very much wanted to be vice_president but I picked a man that I have a lot of respect for and Mike_Pence is doing a great jobLet me just explain -- I never asked John Kasich to be vice_president nor would I And by the way Im leading in Ohio by three pointsQUESTION (inaudible)TRUMP It probably has It probably has

Trump wants to carpet_bomb I never said that That was Ted_Cruz that said that OK That was Ted_Cruz wasnt meWhen Sanders and I_think a lot of his people are going to come to me because of trade But when Bernie_Sanders makes a statement that I wanted to go lower than the minimum_wage lower its a lie So I have a choice All my people say dont respond to it it doesnt matter I say to me it does matter It mattersWhen people tell lies politicians who tell lies very well thats what they do thats why theyre politicians But when politicians tell lies and Im lucky in a sense because I have a big microphone In other_words I can say that Biden lied when he said that Or I can say that I didnt say that Bernie_Sanders And you guys know that I didnt In fact he was criticized by people that fact

about to get oneTRUMP YeahQUESTION Do_you expect your opinion on (inaudible) or your opinion on (inaudible)TRUMP Well well have to see I mean thats my opinion Thats my opinion Well have to see I have a real problem when Hillary_Clinton who gives open access to a phony server is allowed to get these briefings How does Hillary_Clinton get a national_security briefing when shes been probably hacked when so much of her information the director of the FBI said it was essentially negligent It was negligentNow why are they giving her briefings why are these people with great knowledge of the inner workings of our_country and our security why are they giving Hillary_Clinton briefings Because its going to get revealed I mean her number one person Huma Abedin is married to Anthony_Weiner whos a sleazeball and a pervert And Im not saying that I mean thats recorded history rightI dont like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony_Weiner all of these secrets OK So how can Hillary_Clinton be briefed on this unbelievably delicate information when it was just proven that she lied and that her server shouldnt have had it and that theyre missing 33000 e-mails and thats just the beginning So I dont_think that I know at some point theyre_going to be calling theyre_going to want to brief me but Im not a talker about this stuffI dont_think that its safe to have Hillary_Clinton in light of what

(Inaudible) running for the president (inaudible)TRUMP Might as well tell him to have a good time He has done one bad jobOK thank you everybodyOn Monday_night on CNN Carl Bernstein made this proclamation The president and his presidency is in chaosIts a remarkable statement given that we are only 11_days into the presidency of Donald Trump Its also very hard to disputeConsider this amazing and I do mean amazing WaPo story today about The story details the infighting and blame game among Trumps top advisers and includes some eye-popping linesAmong them* Defense_Secretary James Mattis and Homeland_Security Secretary John Kelly fumed privately to associates over the weekend because they had been caught unaware by a travel_ban that was drafted and set into action largely in secret by the White_House according to three people who have spoken with them*The problem theyve got is this is an off-Broadway performance of a show that is now the number one hit on Broadway said former House speaker Newt_Gingrich of the Trump administration (Sidebar Gingrich is an informal adviser to Trump)*A little_bit of under-competence and a slight amount of insecurity can breed some paranoia and backstabbing one White_House official said of White_House chief of staff_Reince Priebus We have to get Reince to relax into the job and become more competent because hes seeing shadows where there are no shadowsAny one of those lines is problematic in a normal White_House The quote from an anonymous White_House official about Priebus who let me emphasize is the is stunning If that line was used in House of Cards I would roll my eyes and say it would never happen in real lifeAnd its not just the Post story that shows the seeming tumult among Trumps senior advisers A in the Wall_Street Journal on Tuesday details how Department of Homeland_Security chief John Kelly is at odds with the White_House over staffing in his organization A Vanity Fair details the struggles of Trump son-in-law and White_House adviser Jared_Kushner as he seeks to exert influence over the presidentRead any one of those stories and the word chaos jumps to mind Or turmoil Or dissension All of them convey the same thing Less than two_weeks into his presidency there is a knife fight happening daily among Trumps top aidesBernstein clearly meant his chaos comments in a negative way Chaos in traditional political thinking is bad It suggests a president who doesnt really have control over his people and a White_House that resembles a roller coaster car shuddering as it travels at too high a speed down the tracksAnd maybe thats all true Its possible that the Trump train is on the verge of jumping the tracks (Mixed metaphor alert)But every indication from what we know of Trump the businessman and reality TV star suggests that he revels in the chaos that he believes the chaos produces just the sort of results he likesThink back to the boardroom on The Apprentice Bring everybody in Let them attack one another and level allegations Consult with a few of your consiglieres and then make a bold and often unpredictable decision Yes that was a TV show But it was a TV show created by Trump (and Mark Burnett) That means that the way the show worked came directly out of Trumps brain and generally speaking represents his view of how things should workRemember that for Trump appearances matter most And he likes the perception of himself as the decider the buck-stopper the only one who can cut through all of the noise and battling egos to make the call In order to make that image truly work you need noise around you at all times So Trump put in place a senior leadership team that would create itThe other important point here is that Trump believes all of life business and politics included amounts to a sort of survival of the fittest/toughest His critique of Hillary_Clintons health during the 2016 campaign was based on the idea that anyone who has a weak moment as Clinton did at a 9/11 memorial service cant possibly be up to the top job in the country For Trump the constant battles between his aides are a sort of real-life Survivor episode The toughest SOB is the one Trump wants And only through political combat can that be determinedThe combination of chaos combat and constant sniping is not a bad thing in the worldview of Donald Trump In fact it is the one truly necessary thingIn the three years before he became Donald Trumps chief_strategist Stephen_K Bannon lived as a virtual nomad in a quest to build a populist political insurgency No presidential adviser in recent memory has followed such a mysterious peripatetic path to the White_House It was as though he was a man with no fixed addressHe owned a house and condo in Southern California where he had entertainment and consulting businesses a drivers license and a checking account He claimed Florida as his residence registering to vote in Miami and telling authorities he lived at the same address as his third ex-wifeAt the same_time he routinely stayed in Washington and New_York as he engineered the expansion of Breitbart_News and hosted a live Breitbart radio program By 2015 Bannon stayed so often at Breitbarts townhouse headquarters on Capitol_Hill that he kept a picture of a daughter on a mantle piece beneath a portrait of Abraham Lincoln Bannon told a friend that year he was living in multiple cities including Washington New_York London and Miami according to an email obtained by The Washington PostThe issue of Bannons legal residency has been simmering since last_summer shortly_after he became chief_executive of Trumps campaign that he was registered to vote at a then-vacant house and speculated that Bannon may have signed an oath that he was a Florida resident to take_advantage of the states lack of state income taxesIn California where Bannon had lived and owned property for more_than two_decades income tax can exceed 12 percentBannon has not responded to repeated requests by The Washington_Post to discuss the matter Two Post reporters sought to independently verify his residency claims using a wide array of publicly available information They obtained utility bills court_records real_estate transactions state driver reports and the checks he wrote to pay municipal taxes in California They interviewed neighbors spoke with landlords and tracked his Breitbart-related activityIn the digital age when most Americans leave a clear footprint of their whereabouts Bannon left a meandering trail filled with ambiguity contradictions and questions The_Post found that Bannon left a negligible footprint in Florida He did_not get a Florida drivers license or register a car in the state He never voted in Florida and neighbors near two homes he leased in Miami said they never saw him His rent and utility bills were sent to his business manager in California Bannons former wife occupied the premises according to a landlord and neighborsAt the same_time Bannon said he was living with his ex-wife she was under investigation for involvement in a plot to smuggle drugs and a cellphone into a Miami jail a law_enforcement document obtained by The_Post shows The_Post learned that state prosecutors in Miami have an active investigation_into Bannons assertions that he was a Florida resident and qualified to vote in the state from 2014 to 2016 In late August investigators subpoenaed Bannons lease of a Coconut Grove home and other documents They also contacted the landlords of that home and another that Bannon leased nearby and sought information from a gardener and handyman who worked at one of the homes according to documents and interviewsBecause state laws do not clearly define residency making a false registration case can be difficult A former investment banker and Hollywood producer Bannon lived in California when he took a turn toward politics nearly a decade_ago He had a condo in Los Angeles and a house just to the south in Laguna Beach in Orange County In 2010 he told Orange County election officials that he wanted to become a permanent absentee voter and have all ballots mailed to his Laguna Beach homeIn 2011 Bannon produced and directed a political documentary about Sarah Palin for the Victory Film Project a company in Sarasota Fla He is listed as a manager of the company in Florida corporate records In March 2012 with the death of founder Andrew Breitbart Bannon became executive chairman of the Los Angeles-based Breitbart_News which was expanding its operations to Washington Bannon was still a resident of California records_show In the November 2012 elections he voted in Orange County by absentee ballot That same month he renewed his California drivers license for five yearsBut in his subsequent travels across the country his living situation became more complicated The details gathered by The_Post create uncertainty about where exactly he was spending the bulk of his timeOn Feb 9 2013 Bannon and Diane Clohesy his former third wife signed a lease application for a three-bedroom house on Opechee_Drive in a lush Miami neighborhood with palm trees and Spanish-style homes Bannon signed as applicant and Clohesy signed as applicants spouseThe two were married in 2006 when Bannon was 53 and Clohesy was 36 They divorced in California in 2009 She had moved to Florida in 2008 starting a new life in Miami Bannon said in court_papers during the divorce But the two remained in touch and she worked on three political documentaries he directed in 2011 and 2012 Bannon told his new landlords that he would be splitting his time between California and Florida according to interviews The_Post conducted with the property owners Bannon and Clohesy both signed the two-yearlease records showThe lease application said Bannon was relocating from California But Devin Kammerer the real_estate agent who represented Bannon and Clohesy said he never_met Bannon in person and only sent him listings by emailIt was Diane who made the decisions about where she wanted to be and shed send over listings to Steve for his approval Kammerer said Diane was very clear on what she wanted The $4900 monthly rent was a big jump for Clohesy who declared on the lease application that her most recent apartment had cost her $950 a month documents_show But by his own account Bannon could afford it He stated on the application that he earned $750000 a year as chairman of Breitbart_News Network a figure that has not been previously reported He also earned $270000 as executive chairman of Arc Entertainment a film distribution company based in Santa Monica Calif In_addition Bannon received about $100000 in salary that year as part-time chairman of the Government Accountability Institute a new nonprofit charity in Tallahassee according to filings with the Internal_Revenue Service Bannon two Breitbart writers and other conservative activists had launched the organization a year earlier and it produced reports and books that were promoted by Breitbart Bannon claimed he worked 30 hours a week at GAI according to IRS filingsJust weeks after signing the Opechee_Drive lease Bannon launched Breitbart_News Sunday with Stephen_K Bannon a three-hour program broadcast live Sunday nights from SiriusXM studios in Washington In May 2013 Bannon opened an account in his name for municipal sewer and water service at the Opechee_Drive residence documents showThe utility account is one of the few public indications of Bannons presence in Florida But Bannon told utility officials to mail the bills to the office of his business manager on Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills Calif according to documents obtained through Florida public records lawsFour neighbors told The_Post they do not recall seeing Bannon at the houseI never saw him said Steven Chastain who lived a few doors away on a nearby street He wasnt living there said Barbara Pope a longtime resident who often walked her dog on Opechee_Drive I would have recognized him At the time Bannon was sharing the lease with Clohesy in Opechee she was apparently involved with another man Neighbors said they repeatedly saw a man they could not identify at the house She filed for a restraining order against Jose A Cabana in 2012 He filed one against her in May 2013 court_records show She was granted a two-year injunction against him and his complaint was dropped after he failed to appear in court Cabana was charged with cocaine distribution in November 2013 and sentenced to 10 years in prison He could not be reached for commentIn October 2013 Clohesy became ensnared in an undercover investigation of a jail guard suspected of smuggling drugs and other contraband to another man a friend of hers in the Miami-Dade County Pre-trial Detention Center according to an arrest warrant for the jail guard Investigators eavesdropping on a phone_call between Clohesy and the inmate heard them arrange for her to deliver a pop tart code for a cellphone along with several ounces of marijuana to a prison guard the warrant said Clohesy who was under surveillance later met with the guard in a parking lot and handed over the marijuana the phone and $700 in cash the warrant said Clohesy was confronted by authorities and agreed to cooperate She told investigators she had known the inmate for more_than a year and maintained a relationship with him through jail visits correspondence and telephone conversationsEfforts to reach Clohesy were unsuccessful Her brother Declan provided The_Post with that Bannon had provided emotional or financial support to help her recover from drug addiction and depressionSteve is a caring and compassionate man and Diane is blessed to still have him in her life the statement said We appreciate the media respecting my sisters privacy at this early stage of her recovery Neighbors of the Opechee_Drive home said they remember Clohesy vividly in part because she had a steady stream of visitors some of them disruptive Four neighbors told The_Post that they had a community meeting with police to complain about noise at the house and cars speeding from the premises at late hoursPolice records_show that officers went to the Opechee address at_least three_times over several months in 2014 The officers were responding to reports about disturbances including loud music In one case a woman at the home called police around midnight to express fears about an ex-boyfriend who was shining a bright light into the windows Her name is redacted in the reportBeatriz Portela a real_estate agent who represented the Opechee landlords said she also received a call and text messages from neighbors who were anxious about troubling incidents at the house including speeding vehicles and a car crash They were super upset Portela said On April 2 2014 more_than a year after Bannon signed the lease on the residence in Coconut Grove he registered to vote in Florida and listed the Opechee_Drive address as his legal home Bannon did_not have to show an ID to register He provided the last four digits of his Social Security number to verify his identityOne of the allures of Florida is its zero income tax rate for in-state residents The_Post was unable to determine what state Bannon claimed as his primary residence for the purpose of income tax Accountants advise people who work in multiple states to carefully document the number of nights they spend in Florida and maintain records of travel housing even of meals Registering to vote is considered one indication of residency as is a drivers license Under state law new residents must apply for a license within 30 days if they intend to operate a vehicle Phillip Sroka a partner at the accounting firm of Morrison Brown Argiz and Farra in Miami said he advises clients who split their time in multiple states to take care to document their presence in Florida for more_than six_months That includes airline tickets restaurant receipts and utility billsIn an_interview with The_Post Sroka said suspicions are raised when individuals have their bills sent outside the states where they claim their residencesIt gets a little sketchy when you accept employment elsewhere he said Where it gets a little on the line and subject to interpretation is where you have a lot of other business_dealings elsewhere As 2015 approached Bannon continued his roving life He rented out his Laguna Beach home and in January 2015 bought a townhouse as a second home in Pinehurst NC The deed lists Bannons mailing address at his money managers office in Beverly HillsOn Feb 18 2015 Bannon ended the water and sewer service at Opechee_Drive and switched the service to Onaway Drive less_than a half mile away in Coconut Grove records_show Five days later Bannon changed his voter_registration to Onaway DriveThe Opechee house was left in disrepair according to an email between the landlord and Bannon and interviews with the landlordPadlocks had been placed on interior doors or the doors had been removed altogether A hot tub was destroyed[E]ntire Jacuzzi bathtub seems to have been covered in acid the landlord wrote in the February 2015 email to Bannon Im out of town Bannon replied is there any way u can talk with Diane and sort things out The damage was estimated at more_than $14000 according to an accounting by the landlords who kept the $9800 security deposit from Bannon and Clohesy Kammerer their real_estate agent said he was troubled by the damageI would not work with them after that he said I would not refer them again as clients of mine Around this time Bannon was becoming a fixture at the Breitbart_News townhouse location in Washington nicknamed the Breitbart Embassy hosting parties meeting with journalists and staying overnightIn a reporter described interviewing Bannon multiple times in January and February at the Breitbart townhouse in WashingtonThe article headlined This Man Is the Most Dangerous Political Operative in America described the building as a 14-room townhouse that [Bannon] occupiesOrdinarily Bannons townhouse is crypt-quiet and feels like a museum as its faithfully decorated down to its embroidered silk curtains and painted murals in authentic Lincoln-era details the article said On Oct 26 2015 SiriusXM announced that Bannons weekend radio show would expand its live broadcasts to weekday mornings from 6 am to 9 am from studios in Washington and New_York Donald Trump was a guest on the inaugural show Nov 2Five months later Bannon shut off sewer and water service at the Onaway address in Miami The house remained uninhabited for monthsThree neighbors interviewed by The_Post said they were confident Bannon had not lived at the homeI often saw Diane said Joseph JL Plummer a prominent Miami resident who lived next door and was a city commissioner for nearly 30_years I never saw himIn mid-August Bannon became chief_executive of the Trump campaign As he was assuming control Bannon changed the address on his Florida voter_registration records On Aug 19 he signed an oath that he now lived at the home of a longtime business associate in Nokomis Fla in Sarasota County The questions about Bannons residency emerged Aug 26 when the Guardian wrote that Bannon had been registered to vote at a vacant house the Onaway address in MiamiThe local NBC station in Miami reported that the state attorneys office had requested Bannons voter records from county election officials At least two people filed complaints about Bannon with the Florida Department of State claiming he had committed voter_fraud by asserting he was a resident documents_show In October the department said the complaints did_not merit an investigation That month Bannon registered to vote in New_York from a Manhattan condo overlooking Bryant Park and later cast an absentee ballot in the presidential_election Because he was registered in two places he was later removed from Floridas voter rollsUnder Florida law it is a third-degree felony to provide false information on a voter_registration application It is punishable by up to five_years in prison First-time offenders are rarely given more_than probation something that could also lead to the loss of a security clearanceOfficials from the State Attorneys Office for Miami-Dade County which is led by an elected Democrat declined to provide details about their probe into Bannons residency claim In denying a Post request for documents about the investigation officials cited confidentiality rules for active criminal investigative informationSpokesman Ed Griffith said At this point it is not overBut proving wrongdoing in Bannons case could be difficult because state law does_not clearly define residency according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymityFacing an upcoming electoral challenge from a populist far-right party Dutch Prime MinisterMark Rutte released an open letter Monday that offered a thinly veiled warning to immigrantsAct normal or go awayRuttes letter was published in a full-page newspaper advertisement and promoted on social_media by his party thecenter-right Peoples Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD)In his message the prime_minister said he understood there were growing concerns in the Netherlands about those coming into the country who dont integrate People who dont_want to adapt [who are] attacking our habits and rejecting our values Rutte wrote who attack gay people who shout at women in short skirts or call ordinary Dutch people racistyou so fundamentally reject our land I prefer that you leave the letter said As it happens I have that feeling too Act normal or go awayRutte repeated his message in a separate interview with the saying that those who do not agree with Dutch values should leave You have the choice go away the prime_minister said You do not need to be hereThe Netherlands ispreparing for nationwide elections to be held on March 15 Rutte who has held the office of prime_minister since 2010 is facing a battle for right-wing voters fromGeert Wilders the outspoken anti-immigration politician who leads the Party for Freedom (PVV)Wilders has capitalized on a populist backlash to refugees and migrants in the Netherlands over the past few years and some have shown support for the PVV nearly equalto VVD ahead of the voteThe populist leader would struggle toform a coalition even if his party won a large amount of votes however Most mainstream parties including the VVD have refused to work with Wilders who was recently convicted of insulting an ethnic group and inciting discrimination after he Ruttes letter didnt mention Wilders by name but it did appear tomildly criticizethe PVVsrhetoric arguing that the solution is not [to] blame a group of people because of one persons actions Among observers however the prime ministers message was widely interpreted as an attempt to appeal to Wilderss supporters ahead of an increasingly competitive electionCas Mudde a Dutch political_scientist at the University of Georgia who studies the European populist radical right said Rutte was trying to show right-wing voters that he could be as tough on immigration and law and order as the PVV It is thinly veiled nativism completely ignoring the anti-refugees violence physical and verbal by natives that the country has experienced in the past years MuddesaidWilders responded to Ruttes letter with a flurry of tweets Monday accusing the prime_minister of stealing his positions Wilders also suggested that Ruttewas being hypocritical as he wasthe man of open borders the asylum tsunami mass immigration Islamization lies and deceptionMark Rutte de man van de open grenzen de asieltsunami de massaimmigratie de islamisering de leugens en het bedrog Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv)AMSTERDAM When Dutch voters go to the polls Wednesday far-right leader Geert Wilders is hoping they will deliver the West its third major populist jolt in less_than a year and the first since Donald Trump won the US presidency in NovemberBut there are growing indications that Trump may be more hindrance than help to Wilderss campaignAfter leading for nearly all of last_year and seeming to be in commanding position as 2017 got underway Wilderss Freedom_Party has fallen sharply in the past two months a period that coincides with the tumultuous dawn of the Trump presidencyIn surveys conducted in recent_days the Freedom_Party has even fallen out of first place slipping just behind the center-right party of Prime_Minister Mark RutteIn the hyper-fragmented world of Dutch politics there will be 28 parties on the ballot Wednesday analysts emphasize that the campaign remains fluid and Wilders could still wind up on top Wilderss own backers say they believe fervently that the polls are underestimating his support just as they did with Trump in the United StatesBut increasingly his competitors are using unfavorable comparisons to the US president to attack Wilders and to try to halt the populist wave that began with Britains vote last June to exit the European UnionThis is our chance to stop this trend Rutte said in a brief interview as he recently campaigned at an Amsterdam shopping mall Theres still a big risk that [Wilders] will be the biggest party But weve_seen the chaos after Brexit and after the elections in America And we cant have that hereTrump is deeply unpopular in the Netherlands as he is across Western Europe And although Wilderss hardcore supporters are unlikely to be deterred by the comparisons to Trump they may be effective among those who want to shake up the system but not quite in the Trump has during his first weeks in officeTrump is the biggest antidote to Wilders said Geert Tomlow a former Freedom_Party candidate who still agrees with much of the partys agenda People are aware that a Wilders type of person wont give them the change theyre looking forThe drop in the polls for Wilders is just the latest evidence that a Trump backlash in Europe may be helping the political establishment fight back against the spread of nationalistic far-right movements across the continentIn Germany where parliamentary elections are due in September the long-beleaguered center-left Social Democrats saw a pronounced poll bump after leader Martin Schulz against Trump In France with a presidential vote just around the corner this spring centrist Emmanuel Macron has been gaining on the far-rights Marine Le_Pen in measures of first-round supportTrump and Wilders have much in common Both delight in bashing the political establishment and seek to mobilize voters with nativist anti-immigrant appeals Both also relish doling out bombast in 140-character bitesWilders took a cue from the US elections as to how Donald Trump has done this The whole point is to denounce people the media the establishment said Sijbrende Jong an analyst at The Hague Center for Strategic Studies Its politics on the basis of emotion Its completely devoid of contentEarly in the campaign Rutte seemed intent on stealing some of Wilderss emotional thunder by mimicking his message In an open letter Rutte called on people in the Netherlands to The letter appeared aimed_at immigrants who fail to integrate referring to people who are attacking our habits and rejecting our values who attack gay people who shout at women in short skirts or call ordinary Dutch people racistBut in the recent interview Rutte said the letter was targeted more broadly at anyone who fails to act normal including those who take extreme positions that demonize immigrants and refugeesJoost Sneller a candidate for the centrist D66 party said it was up to Wilderss opponents not to try to co-opt his message but to convince voters that theres a better wayAs a small country he said the Netherlands has only succeeded when its engaged with the world with commerce art and ideasIts open society versus closed society he said Weve been strong by being openThat message Sneller said is getting out His party has been gaining in the polls as Wilders and his allies decline and has edged into a virtual tie for third placeWhat we hear on the doorstep is We cant have Trump-like things happen here Sneller said Its time to stand upHouse Republican leaders plan to propose preserving the top income-tax rate for very wealthy people a last-minute adjustment to their plan to overhaul the tax code that they hope will assuage concerns that it will mainly benefit the rich according to four people briefed on the planning TuesdayGOP leaders had planned to collapse the seven existing income tax brackets into three brackets lowering the top rate from 396percent to 35percent but now will retain the top bracket for people earning more_than a certain threshold perhaps $1000000 the people saidThe detail was one of several that emerged Tuesday as GOP leaders scrambled to put the final touches on their plan widely seen as the last best chance for Trump and congressional Republicans to advance a major policy achievement this year Drafters planned to work through the night on the bill and unveil it Wednesday but later decided to delay it to Thursday said House Ways and Means Committee_Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex) its lead authorAfter a closed-door meeting of his panel Tuesday night Brady issued a statement saying In consultation with President Trump and our leadership team we have decided to release the bill text on Thursday He said they remain on schedule to take action and approve a bill next week The delay raises questions about whether Republicans have resolved all of their differences amid concerns that even a few defections could prevent the bill from passingThe bill will aim to slash corporate tax rates simplify taxes for individuals and families and lure the foreign operations of multinational firms back to the United_States with incentives and penaltiesThe decision to preserve a top rate signals that Republicans are eager to avoid the impression that their plan which has already come under attack as doing little to boost the middle class seeks only to reward wealthy Americans and corporations And the move could attract the support of more moderate RepublicansThe House and Senate plan to work on separate tracks to pass legislation by Thanksgiving and send a bill to President Trump for his signature by years end though many expect it will take longer than that if the effort succeeds at allIt will be the biggest tax event in the history of our_country Trump promised on Tuesday during a meeting with business trade groups at the White_House a claim he has made repeatedly Later in a tweet he said the Republican House members are working hard (and late) toward the Massive Tax Cuts that they know you deserveIn a sign that House Republicans are willing to go only so_far to mollify concerns about inequality they plan to move ahead with a proposal to eliminate the estate tax though it would be phased out over a number of years They also will propose changes to tax-protected retirement savings plans such as 401(k)s in an effort to raise revenue But Brady said Tuesday those changes remained in flux and that 401(k)s might ultimately be left aloneOverall House Republicans say their plan will reduce federal tax revenue by $15trillion over the next decade Keeping the tax rate for people earning over $1million could reduce the impact on the deficit by about $200billion over a decade according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal BudgetHouse Majority_Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif) said Tuesday that Bradys tax plan would lower the corporate tax rate from 35percent to 20percent as demanded by Trump A new wrinkle was emerging late Tuesday however with concern growing that the corporate tax reduction might not be able to be made permanent if it proves too costlyBusiness leaders will fight hard to prevent Republicans from allowing the rate to go back up after several years but the GOP could be hamstrung because it cannot push into law a tax change that adds too_much to the deficitNumerous details of the tax proposal came during a briefing that House Speaker Paul D Ryan (R-Wis) had Tuesday afternoon with conservative activists Grover Norquist president of Americans for Tax Reform is one of the people who confirmed the 396percent rate would remain for the highest incomeOverall Im very happy with the bill said Adam Brandon who is chief_executive of FreedomWorks and attended the Ryan briefing My read is that everyone is going to be seeing a tax cutCurrently families pay the 396percent rate on income above $470700 so the proposal would still lower taxes for people who earn above the lower amountThe implications of the changes envisioned by GOP leaders could be far-reaching but numerous aspects remain uncertainThousands of companies that pay their taxes through the individual income-tax code would see their rates lowered on top income from 396percent to 25percent Its unclear_whether there would be new provisions to prevent more-wealthy individuals from creating companies to pay the 25percent rate on their income rather_than the higher rateThe new proposal is expected to include a new minimum tax that US companies will be required to pay on certain foreign earnings as a way to prevent them from moving US operations to low-tax countries Businesses are watching carefully how the House bill deals with US companies that produce goods overseas and then sell them back into the United StatesThe House GOP plan would also allow companies to immediately expense capital investments such as new equipment for five_years but cut back the ability to deduct interest paymentsMany businesses and the wealthy are expected to be the biggest beneficiaries according to initial versions of the plan while the impact on many in the middle class is disputed and less clearThe proposal would roughly double the standard deduction that many Americans can claim to exempt a portion of their income from taxation but it would also eliminate the personal exemption which tends to benefit families with multiple children But the tax plan is expected to expand the child tax credit something Ivanka Trump has said will help working familiesThe House GOP plan would allow Americans to deduct the property taxes they pay from their income but prohibit for the first time Americans from deducting the state and local income taxes they pay from their federal taxable income a simmering issue that threatens to rip apart the GOP coalition needed to approve the billThe plan would also abolish the alternative minimum tax a system set_up to ensure people do not claim so many deductions that they pay too little in taxes McCarthy saidThe economic success of the package hinges on controversial economic theories that assume large tax_cuts for businesses and the wealthy will lead to economic_growth and wage gains for everyone else a conclusion that economists and policymakers have debated for decadesBut Republicans have a rare lock of political power controlling the White_House House and Senate and are desperate to regain political footing lost after a number of missteps this year particularly the failure to rewrite health-care policyThe speed with which they are doing this is more about politics than it is about policy said Rep Richard E Neal (Mass) the ranking_Democrat on Bradys committee They dont_want people to see whats in it and I_think they need a victoryThe tax package is expected to reduce revenue by more_than $4trillion over 10 years Republicans hope to recoup some of that lost revenue by eliminating a number of tax breaks but they have been careful not to identify all of these changes in part because they expect a revolt from interest groups that would be affectedTheyve got $4trillion worth of tax promises and they basically at this point have got virtually no revenue in order to pay for it Sen Ron Wyden (D-Ore) said Tuesday So what they have done is basically made it clear that their promises to the middle class are really not worth the paper they are written on They are false promises to the middle classWhite House officials and GOP congressional leaders have met for months to try to establish the framework for rewriting the tax code but they agreed only on broad parameters Big tests now loom for Brady and his Senate counterpart Finance Committee_Chairman Orrin G Hatch (R-Utah) to craft legislation that can pass both chambersThe government collects roughly $4trillion a year in taxes and other revenue a threshold that still falls short of how_much money it spendsTrump says the changes could lead to an immediate jolt in economic_growth saying on Tuesday that it could lead companies to bring more_than $4trillion in past foreign earnings back to the United_States He also said it would lead to a flood of companies moving back to the country lured by big tax_cuts and the threat that their foreign earnings will be subject to stricter taxation for the first timeIt is details such as those though that will be the focus of several intense weeks of negotiations in the House and Senate GOP tax writers are also expected to have a much different approach to the taxation of profits overseasResolving these differences will be crucial because Republicans have signaled they will try to push the tax_cuts into law without any support from Democrats testing the slim margin they control in the Senate and their balky caucus in the HouseGiven that they are trying to do this with a one-party approach they dont have a lot of flexibility said Alan Auerbach director of the Burch Center for Tax Policy

a bill approved by a US House committee this week becomes lawIn general employersdont have that power under existing federal laws which protect genetic privacy and nondiscrimination But a bill passed Wednesday by theHouse Committee on Education and the Workforce would allow employers to get around thoseobstacles if the information is collected as part of a workplace wellness programSuchprograms which offer workers a variety ofcarrots and sticksto monitor and improve their health such as lowering cholesterol have become increasingly popularwith companiesSome offer discounts on health_insurance to employees who complete health-risk assessments Others might charge people more for smokingUnder the Affordable_Care Act employers are allowed to discount health_insurance premiums by up to 30 percent and in some cases 50 percent for employees who voluntarily participate in a wellness program where theyre required to meet certain health targets The bill is under review by other House committees and still must be considered by the Senate But it has already faced strong criticism from a broad array of groups as well as House Democrats In a letter sent to the committee earlier_this week representing consumer health and medical advocacy groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics AARP March of Dimes and the National Womens Law Center said the legislation if enacted would undermine basic privacy provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act and the 2008 Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act()Congress passed GINA to prohibit discrimination by health insurers and employers based on the information that people carry in their genes There is an exception that allows for employees to provide that information as part of voluntary wellness programs But the law states that employee participation must be entirely voluntary with no incentives for providing the dataor penalties for not providing itBut theHouse legislation would allow employers to impose penalties of up to 30 percent of the total cost of the employees health_insurance on those who choose to keep such information private Its a terrible Hobsons choice between

choicessNorth Korean state media are known for hyperbole but even so the official announcement of the execution of Jang Song Thaek is a step beyond The state-run_Korean Central_News Agency released a long article detailing the alleged crimes and transgressions of Jang a longtime senior regime official who was also the uncle of leader_Kim Jong UnIt really must be read to be believed A typical line asserts for example that Jang behaved so arrogantly and insolently as unwillingly standing up from his seat and half-heartedly clapping touching off towering resentment of our service personnel and people Here is how the release startsPYONGYANG December 13 0623 KST (KCNA) Upon hearing the report on the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers_Party of Korea the service personnel and people throughout the country broke into angry shouts that a stern judgment of the revolution should be meted out to the anti-party counter-revolutionary factional elements Against the backdrop of these shouts rocking the country a special military tribunal of the DPRK Ministry of State Security was held on December 12 against traitor for all ages Jang Song ThaekThe accused Jang brought together undesirable forces and formed a faction as the boss of a modern day factional group for a long time and thus committed such hideous crime as attempting to overthrow the state by all sorts of intrigues and despicable methods with a wild ambition to grab the supreme power of our party and stateThough North_Korea has had many political purges the highly public nature of this one has been unprecedented since Pyongyang first revealed it on Dec 8 when state TV showed uniformed troops escorting Jang out of a Politburo meeting The over-the-top language of this release although awfully easy for outsiders to laugh at is an important component of the purge -- and a potentially significant hint of whats_happening there and why Well have a fuller look at Jangs purge shortly so do check backThe full KCNA release is preserved here (state media has ) The rest of the release followsThe tribunal examined Jangs crimesAll the crimes committed by the accused were proved in the course of hearing and were admitted by himA decision of the special military tribunal of the Ministry of State Security of the DPRK was read out at the trialEvery sentence of the decision served as sledge-hammer blow brought down by our angry service personnel and people on the head of Jang an anti-party counter-revolutionary factional element and despicable political careerist and tricksterThe accused is a traitor to the nation for all ages who perpetrated anti-party counter-revolutionary factional acts in a bid to overthrow the leadership of our party and state and the socialist systemJang was appointed to responsible posts of the party and state thanks to the deep political trust of President Kim_Il Sung and leader_Kim Jong_Il and received benevolence from them more_than any others from long agoHe held higher posts than before and received deeper trust from supreme leader_Kim Jong_Un in particularThe political trust and benevolence shown by the peerlessly great men of Mt Paektu were something he hardly deservedIt is an elementary obligation of a human being to repay trust with sense of obligation and benevolence with loyaltyHowever despicable human scum Jang who was worse than a dog perpetrated thrice-cursed acts of treachery in betrayal of such profound trust and warmest paternal love shown by the party and the leader for himFrom long ago Jang had a dirty political ambition He dared not raise his head when Kim_Il Sung and Kim_Jong Il were alive But reading their faces Jang had an axe to grind and involved himself in double-dealing He began revealing his true colors thinking that it was just the time for him to realize his wild ambition in the period of historic turn when the generation of the revolution was replacedJang committed such an unpardonable thrice-cursed treason as overtly and covertly standing in the way of settling the issue of succession to the leadership with an axe to grind when a very important issue was under discussion to hold respected Kim_Jong Un in high esteem as the only successor to Kim_Jong Il in reflection of the unanimous desire and will of the entire party and army and all peopleWhen his cunning move proved futile and the decision that Kim_Jong Un was elected vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Workers_Party of Korea at the Third Conference of the WPK in reflection of the unanimous will of all party members service personnel and people was proclaimed making all participants break into enthusiastic cheers that shook the conference hall he behaved so arrogantly and insolently as unwillingly standing up from his seat and half-heartedly clapping touching off towering resentment of our service personnel and peopleJang confessed that he behaved so at that time as a knee-jerk reaction as he thought that if Kim_Jong Uns base and system for leading the army were consolidated this would lay a stumbling block in the way of grabbing the power of the party and stateWhen Kim_Jong Il passed away so suddenly and untimely to our sorrow he began working in real earnest to realize its long-cherished greed for powerAbusing the honor of often accompanying Kim_Jong Un during his field guidance Jang tried hard to create illusion about him by projecting himself internally and externally as a special being on a par with the headquarters of the revolutionIn a bid to rally a group of reactionaries to be used by him for toppling the leadership of the party and state he let the undesirable and alien elements including those who had been dismissed and relieved of their posts after being severely punished for disobeying the instructions of Kim_Jong Il and kowtowing to him work in a department of the Central Committee of the WPK and organs under it in a crafty mannerJang did serious harm to the youth movement in our_country being part of the group of renegades and traitors in the field of youth work bribed by enemies Even after they were disclosed and purged by the resolute measure of the party he patronized those cats paws and let them hold important posts of the party and stateThere are so many twists and turns in the story involving President Trump and his team and Russian_meddling in the 2016 US elections As a public service The Fact_Checker is keeping track of the various tentacles of this complex saga and highlighting any inconsistencies or falsehoods we can findReviewing our fact_checks so_far its clear that in many cases the White_Houses rhetoric shifted as The Washington_Post or the New_York Times uncovered new information and revealed that officials were being misleading or obfuscating the truth with their rhetoric Since January 2017 we compiled numerous timelines just to keep track of what Trump and his aides said when they said it what the public knew at the time of their statements and how they shifted over time We also fact-checked misleading attacks by Democrats about actions by Trump administration officialsThe special_counsels investigation is underway so this story keeps evolving Each fact check and this roundup will be updated as new information becomes availableHeres a chronological compilation of 14 Trump-Russia fact_checks since January 2017 We linked to video fact_checks where available Click on the headline to read each columnOn Jan 6 2017 US intelligence_agencies published a high-confidence assessment that Russian President_Vladimir Putin ordered a cyberattack during the 2016_presidential election with the aim of undermining faith in the US democratic process and hurting Hillary_Clintons electability We decoded then-White House chief of staff_Reince Priebuss spin misleading the public in an effort to play down the findings in the assessmentOn Feb 13 2017 then-national security_adviser Michael_Flynn was fired White_House officials knew for weeks that Flynn had misled about the nature of his December 2016 calls with Russian_Ambassador Sergey_Kislyak but he was only pressured to resign after The_Post uncovered it Flynns statements to The_Post shifted from an outright denial to a less equivocal one as The_Post uncovered more information We compiled a timeline of events dating to December 2016 that led to Flynns firingOn March 1 that Attorney_General Jeff_Sessions in 2016 had met twice with Russian_Ambassador Sergey_Kislyak but did_not disclose them in his Senate confirmation_hearing In a swipe at Sessions Sen Claire_McCaskill (D-Mo) tweeted that she had no calls or meetings with the Russian_ambassador over her 10 years on the Senate_Armed Services_Committee But we easily found earlier tweets from 2013 and 2015 that showed she did indeed have such interactions with the Russian_ambassador in the past McCaskill received Three PinocchiosHouse Minority Leader Nancy_Pelosi (D-Calif) rebuked Sessions for not disclosing his contacts with Kislyak and claimed Congress impeached President Bill_Clinton for something far_less than what Sessions had done But that description was a stretch While the Sessions and Clinton cases both involve statements made under_oath the circumstances were vastly different (Later Sessions would recuse_himself from the Trump-Russia investigation due to his campaign contacts with Kislyak) Pelosi earned Two PinocchiosOn May 8 former acting_attorney general Sally Yates testified that she had informed White_House Counsel on Jan 26 that Flynn lied about the nature of his calls with Kislyak Yet it took 18 days and The Posts reporting for Trump to act In response to Yatess testimony Trump blamed former president_Barack Obama for giving Flynn a security clearance in the first place and elevating Flynn But this was just a distraction with little factual basis Trump received Three PinocchiosOn May 9 2017 Trump fired James_B Comey as FBI_director As a justification Trump and Attorney_General Jeff_Sessions pointed to Comeys_handling of the agencys investigation_into Hillary_Clintons private email_server But during the 2016_presidential campaigns neither Trump nor Sessions was outwardly critical of Comeys decisions at_least in the same way they were in May 2017 In this column we explored inconsistencies in both mens rhetoric over Comeys_handling of the Clinton investigationOver the three days after Comeys_firing the exact reason for his dismissal remained elusive In this column we outlined all the contradictory explanations from Trump and his White_House At first Trump said he was merely acting on a Justice_Department recommendation Several explanations later Trump ultimately revealedthat he had planned on firing Comey all along because Trump did_not want Comey overseeing the FBI investigation_into Russian_meddling in the 2016 electionOn May 15 The_Post reported that Trump revealed highly classified_information to the Russian foreign_minister and ambassador in a White_House meeting and that Trumps disclosures jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic_State In response national_security adviser HR McMaster made comments that obscured the fact that he essentially confirmed the key factual elements of The_Post article In this column we translated McMasters rhetoricBy the end of May it was clear that the story of Flynn merged with the firing of Comey So we compiled a new timeline of events incorporating both story lines showing the complicated relationship between Trump and ComeyOn June 8 Comey testified to the Senate_Intelligence Committee and offered his version of events for the first time The testimony revealed several contradictory statements made by Trump and Comey about the same meetings and discussions We also compiled a Fact_Checker video timeline of the he-said he-said storyNo matter what new development is revealed in the Trump-Russia story one thing has remained consistent Trump blames the Democrats not the Russians Trump calls it a hoax witch_hunt and fake_news despite findings by the US intelligence_community and even after the White_House confirmed reports of his teams interactions with RussiansAfter Comey was fired former FBI_director Robert_S Mueller_III was appointed special_counsel to oversee the Russia investigation and related matters As Mueller assembled his team of investigators Trump and his surrogates began attacking donations made by some of Muellers attorneys They questioned Muellers independence as some members of his team previously donated to Hillary_Clinton Barack_Obama or the Democratic_Party But this is a baseless attack legally and under federal ethics rules such donations pose no conflict of interest Trump earned Three PinocchiosIn June Mueller widened the scope of his investigation including whether Trump obstructed justice when firing Comey As a result with every new development Trumps critics are quick to call for his impeachment and label his actions as obstruction of justice But its not so simple and the complexities of the process get muddled with heated rhetoric In this column we answered some key questions about obstruction of justice impeachment and executive privilegeOn July 8 2017 the New_York Times revealed that Donald Trump Jr met with a Russian attorney with ties to the Kremlin during the 2016 campaign In following days Trump Jr provided contradictory and misleading statements that shifted as the Times uncovered new information about the meeting While Trump Jr previously claimed that he never set_up a meeting with a Russian national for campaign purposes that turned_out to be falseIn response to questions about the Trump campaigns contacts with Russia the White_House began deflecting to efforts by a Ukrainian American operative to expose former Trump campaign_chairman Paul Manaforts ties to the Russian_government The White_House now claims that the real story of coordination is between the Clinton campaign and Ukraine But this is a facile comparison with key differences between the situations that make them fundamentally different We left the claim unrated for now because we do not know the full set of facts in either the Trump-Russia or Clinton-Ukraine storiesWhite House Press Secretary Sarah_Huckabee Sanders asserted that Fusion_GPS a research firm run by ex-journalists took money from the Russian_government while it arranged for the creation of a dossier about Trumps ties to RussiaBut she is mixing up two unrelated clients of the firm There were Russian entities involved but there is currently no_evidence that the Russian_government paid for Fusions work on the defense of a Russian bank accused of fraud at the same_time Fusion investigated Trumps business_dealings in Russia Huckabee earned Three Pinocchios for spin that fell flat()FBI agents raided the home in Alexandria_Va of President Trumps former campaign_chairman arriving in the pre-dawn hours late last_month andseizing documents and other materials related to the special_counsel investigation of Russian_meddling in the 2016 electionThe raid which occurred without warning on July26 signaled an aggressive new approach by special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III and his team in dealing with a key figure in the Russia inquiry Manafort has been under increasing pressure as the Mueller team looked into his personal finances and his professional career as a highly paid foreign political consultantUsing a search_warrant agents appeared the day Manafort was scheduled to testify before the Senate_Judiciary Committee and a day after he met voluntarily with Senate_Intelligence Committee staff membersThe search_warrant requested documents related to tax banking and other matters People familiar_with the search said agents departed the Manafort residence with a trove of material including binders prepared ahead of Manaforts congressional testimonyInvestigators in the Russia inquiry have previously sought documents with subpoenas which are less intrusive and confrontational than a search_warrant With a warrant agents can inspect a physical location and seize any useful information To get a judge to sign off on a search_warrant prosecutors must show that there is probable_cause that a crime has been committed I_think it adds a shock and awe enforcement component to what until now has followed a natural path for a white-collar investigation said Jacob Frenkel a former federal_prosecutor More so than anything else weve_seen so_far it really does send a powerful law_enforcement message when the search_warrant is used That message is that the special_counsel team will use all criminal investigative tools available to advance the investigation as quickly and as comprehensively as possibleJason Maloni a spokesman for Manafort confirmed that agents executed a warrant at one of the political consultants homes and that Manafort cooperated with the searchManafort has been voluntarily providing documents to congressional_committees investigating Russias election interference The search_warrant indicates that investigators may have argued to a federal_judge that they had reason to think Manafort could not be trusted to turn over all records in response to a grand_jury subpoenaThe raid also could have been intended to send a message to Trumps former campaign_chairman that he should not expect gentle treatment or legal courtesies from Muellers_team members who already have begun combing through Manaforts complicated financial past The documents seizedin the raid include materials Manafort already had provided to Congress said people_familiar with the search and the significance of what was obtained remained unclear Wednesday eveningIf the FBI wanted the documents they could just ask [Manafort] and he would have turned them over said one adviser close to the White HouseJosh Stueve spokesman for Mueller declined to comment as did Reginald Brown an attorney for Manafort Mr Manafort has consistently cooperated with law_enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well said Maloni the Manafort spokesmanSen Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn) a member of the Judiciary_Committee and a former US attorney called the search a significant and even stunning development noting that such raids are generally reserved for the most serious criminal investigations dealing with uncooperative or untrusted potential targetsA federal_judge signing this warrant would demand persuasive evidence of probable_cause that a serious crime has been committed and that less intrusive and dramatic investigative means would be ineffective he said in a statement Mueller has increased legal pressure on Manafort consolidating under his authority unrelated investigations of various aspects of Manaforts professional and personal lifeManaforts allies fear that Mueller hopes to build a case against Manafort unrelated to the 2016 campaign in hopes that he would provide information against others in Trumps inner_circle in exchange for lessening his legal exposureManafort has provided more_than 300 pages ofdocuments to the Senate_Judiciary Committee and the Senate and House intelligence committees The information includes notes Manafort took while attending a meeting with Donald Trump Jr and a Russian lawyer at Trump_Tower in June_2016 Emails show that Trump Jr accepted the meeting and invited Manafort after he was told that the Russian lawyer would provide damaging_information about Democrat Hillary_Clinton as part of a Russian_government effort to assist his fathers campaignThe special_counsels office has subpoenaed records and testimony related to the Trump_Tower meeting people_familiar with the investigation saidLast week the Trump campaign turned over more_than 20000 pages of documents to congressional_investigators examining Russian efforts to influence the election Manafort and Trump Jr separately turned over hundreds of documents requested by congressional committeesManafort had been subpoenaed to appear before the Senate_Judiciary Committee on July 26 the day of the raid Ultimately however the subpoena was withdrawn and he did_not testify Thecommittee chairman Sen Charles_E Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen Dianne Feinstein (Calif) the panels ranking_Democrat said in a joint statement that they had dropped the demand after Manafort began producing documents Manafort an experienced political operative who was oncea business_partner of Trump confidant Roger Stonewas hired to professionalize the Trump campaign at the recommendationof another Trump friend Tom Barrack an international real_estate investorAs a political consultant Manafort traveled the world at times offering advice to despots and dictatorsHis decade of work in Ukraine on behalf of a Russia-friendly political party has drawn attention from the FBI In Kiev he advised the Party of Regions helping to elect former president Viktor_Yanukovych who was ousted from power amid public protests in 2014 and fled to RussiaA few_days after attending the Trump_Tower meeting in June_2016 at the urging of Trump Jr Manafort was named chairman of Trumps campaign following the ouster of campaign_manager Corey_Lewandowski Manafort remained in that role through the Republican_National Convention and into August when he resigned amid growing scrutiny of his work in Ukraine The New_York Times reported at the time that his name was found in a ledger of off-the-books cash payments made by the Party of Regions Manafort has denied receiving any improper payments from the partyStill the work was lucrative In June Manafort filed Foreign_Agents Registration_Act paperwork with the Justice_Department providing new details about his work in Ukraine The documents showed that his firm was paid $171million for its work in Ukraine over two years before expensesManaforts retroactive filing about his Ukraine work came as investigators scrutinized his foreign lobbying and began to aggressively probe his financial pastDuring the spring prosecutors issued subpoenas seeking information about his income sources and financial transactions One subpoena reviewed by The Washington_Post sought information concerning contracts for work communication or other records of correspondence related to about two dozen people and businesses that appeared to be connected to Manafort or his wife including some who worked for Manafort while he was a political consultant in UkraineThe subpoena was issued by a federal grand_jury in the Eastern District of Virginia where Manaforts consulting business has been located Also named in the subpoena were various corporations formed in Cyprus Manafort appeared to have routed money he earned in Ukraine and in business_dealings with a Russian business magnate through Cyprus-based bank accountsAfter Mueller was appointed his team took over the Manafort investigation that was underway in VirginiaState authorities in New_York also have issued subpoenas seeking information about Manaforts real_estate loansAnd Muellers office has taken over an investigation of financial dealings that involved Manafort and his son-in-law a real_estate investor including real_estate transactions in California Philip_Rucker Matt Zapotosky and Julie_Tate contributed to this_reportThe FBI obtained a secret court order last_summer to monitor the communications of an adviser to presidential_candidate Donald Trump part of an investigation_into possible links_between Russia and the campaign law_enforcement and other US officials said The FBI and the Justice_Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Pages communications after convincing a Foreign_Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable_cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power in this case Russia according to the officials This is the clearest evidence so_far that the FBI had reason to believe during the 2016_presidential campaign that a Trump campaign adviser was in touch with Russian agents Such contacts are now at the center of an investigation_into whether the campaign coordinated with the Russian_government to swing the election Page has not been accused of any crimes and it is unclear_whether the Justice_Department might later seek charges_against him or others in connection with Russias meddling in the 2016_presidential electioninvestigations dont result in criminal chargesThe officials spoke about the court order on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of a counterintelligence probeDuring an_interview with the Washington_Post editorial page staff in March_2016 who had previously been an investment banker in Moscow as a foreign_policy adviser to his campaign Campaign spokeswoman Pages role as informalPage has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in his dealings with the Trump campaign or Russia This confirms all of my suspicions about unjustified politically motivated government surveillance Page said in an_interview Tuesday I have nothing to hide He compared surveillance of him to the eavesdropping that the FBI and Justice_Department conducted against civil_rights leader Martin Luther King Jr The White_House FBI and Justice_Department declined to commentFBI Director_James B_Comey disclosed in public testimony to the House_Intelligence Committee last_month that the bureau is investigating efforts by the Russian_government to interfere in the 2016_presidential election Comey said this includes investigating the nature of any links_between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian_government and whether there was any coordination_between the campaign and Russias effortsComey declined to comment during the hearing about any individuals including Page who worked in Moscow for Merrill_Lynch a decade_ago and who has said he invested in Russian energy giant Gazprom In a letter to Comey in September Page had said he had sold his Gazprom investmentDuring the hearing last_month Democratic lawmakers repeatedly singled out Pages contacts in Russia as a cause for concern The judges who rule on Foreign_Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requests oversee the nations most sensitive national_security cases and their warrants are some of the most closely guarded secrets in the world of US law_enforcement and intelligence gathering Any FISA application has to be approved at the highest_levels of the Justice_Department and the FBIApplications for FISA warrants Comey said are often thicker than his wrists and that thickness represents all the work Justice_Department attorneys and FBI_agents have to do to convince a judge that such surveillance is appropriate in an investigation The governments application for the surveillance order targeting Page included a lengthy declaration that laid out investigators basis for believing that Page was an agent of the Russian_government and knowingly engaged in clandestine intelligence activities on behalf of Moscow officials said Among other things the application cited contacts that he had with a Russian intelligence operative in New_York City in 2013 officials said Those contacts had earlier surfaced in a federal espionage case brought by the Justice_Department against the intelligence operative and two other Russian agents In_addition the application said Page had other contacts with Russian operatives that have not been publicly disclosed officials said An application for electronic surveillance under the Foreign_Intelligence Surveillance Act need not show evidence of a crime But the information obtained through the intercepts can be used to open a criminal investigation and may be used in a prosecutionThe application also showed that the FBI and the Justice_Departments national_security division have been seeking since July to determine how broad a network of accomplices Russia enlisted in attempting to influence the 2016_presidential election the officials saidSince the 90-day warrant was first issued it has been renewed more_than once by the FISA court the officials said In February Page told PBS NewsHour that he was a junior member of the [Trump] campaigns foreign_policy advisory groupA former Trump campaign adviser said Page submitted policy memos to the campaign and several_times asked to be given a meeting with Trump though his request was never granted He was one of the more active ones in terms of being in touch the adviser saidThe campaign adviser said Page participated in three dinners held for the campaigns volunteer foreign_policy advisers in the spring and summer of 2016 coming from New_York to Washington to meet with the group Although Trump did_not attend Sen_Jeff Sessions_(R-Ala) a top Trump confidant who became his attorney_general attended one meeting of the group with Page in late summer the campaign adviser said Pages role as an adviser to the Trump campaign drew alarm last_year from more-established foreign_policy experts in part because of Pages effusive praise for Russian President_Vladimir Putin and his criticism of US sanctions over Moscows military intervention in Ukraine In July Page traveled to Moscow where he delivered a speech harshly critical of the United_States policy toward Russia While there Page allegedly met with Igor Sechin a Putin confidant and chief_executive of the energy company Rosneft according to a dossier compiled by a former_British intelligence_officer and cited at a congressional hearing by Rep Adam_B Schiff_(Calif) the ranking_Democrat on the House_Intelligence Committee Officials said some of the information in the dossier has been verified by US intelligence_agencies and some of it hasnt while other parts are unlikely to ever be proved or disprovedOn Tuesday Page dismissed what he called the dodgy dossier of false allegationsPage has denied such a meeting occurred saying he has never_met Sechin in his life and that he wants to testify before Congress to clear his name A spokesman for Rosneft told Politico in September that the notion that Page met with Sechin was absurd Page said in September that he briefly met Russian Deputy Prime_Minister Arkady Dvorkovich during that trip Comey has declined to discuss the details of the Russia probe but in an appearance last_month he cited the process for getting FISA warrants as proof that the governments surveillance powers are very carefully used with significant oversightIt is a pain in the neck to get permission to conduct electronic surveillance in the United_States And thats good he told an audience at the University of Texas in Austin Officials have said the FBI and the Justice_Department were particularly reluctant to seek FISA warrants of campaign figures during the 2016_presidential race because of concerns that agents would inadvertently eavesdrop on political talk To obtain a FISA warrant prosecutors must show that a significant purpose of the warrant is to obtain foreign intelligence information Page is the only American to have had his communications directly targeted with a FISA warrant in 2016 as part of the Russia probe officials said The FBI routinely obtains FISA warrants to monitor the communications of foreign diplomats in the United_States including the Russian_ambassador The conversations between Kislyak and Michael_Flynn who became Trumps first national_security adviser were recorded in December In February The Washington_Post reported that Flynn misled Vice President-elect Mike_Pence and others about his discussions with Kislyak prompting Trumps decision to fire himIn March Trump made unsubstantiated claims about US surveillance of Trump_Tower in New_York Later that month Rep_Devin Nunes_(R-Calif) chairman of the House_Intelligence Committee and a Trump transition official charged that details about people associated with the incoming administration details with little apparent foreign intelligence value were widely disseminated in intelligence_community reporting He said none of the surveillance was related to Russia The FISA order on Page is unrelated to either chargeLast month the former director of national intelligence James_R Clapper_Jr told NBCs Meet the Press that US law_enforcement agencies did_not have any FISA orders to monitor the communications of Trump either as a candidate or as a president-elect or his campaign But Clapper did_not address whether there were any FISA warrants targeting Trump associates Three years before Page became an adviser to the Trump campaign he came to the attention of FBI counterintelligence agents who learned that Russian spy suspects had sought to use Page as a source for information In that case one of the Russian suspects Victor Podobnyy who was posing as a diplomat and was later charged by federal_prosecutors with acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government was captured on tape in 2013 discussing an effort to get information and documents from Page That discussion was detailed in a federal complaint filed against Podobnyy and two others The court_documents in that spy case only identify Page as Male 1 Officials familiar_with the case said that Male 1 is PageIn one secretly recorded conversation detailed in the complaint Podobnyy said Page wrote that he is sorry he went to Moscow and forgot to check his inbox but he wants to meet when he gets back I_think he is an idiot and forgot who I am Plus he writes to me in Russian [to] practice the language He flies to Moscow more often than I do He got hooked on Gazprom thinking that if they have a project he could rise up Maybe he can I dont_know but its obvious that he wants to earn lots of moneyThe same court document says that in June 2013 Page told FBI_agents that he met Podobnyy at an energy symposium in New_York where they exchanged contact information In subsequent meetings Page shared with the Russian his outlook on the state of the energy industry as well as documents about the energy business according to the court papersIn the secret tape Podobnyy said he liked the mans enthusiasm but planned to use him to get information and give him little in return You promise a favor for a favor You get the documents from him and tell him to go f--- himself Podobnyy said on the tape according to court papersPage has said the information he provided to the Russians in 2013 was innocuous describing it as basic immaterial information and publicly available research documents He said he had assisted the prosecutors in their case against Evgeny Buryakov who pleaded_guilty to conspiring to act in the United_States as an unregistered agent of Russian intelligence Rosalind_S Helderman contributed to this_reportThe former_British spy who authored a controversial dossier on behalf of Donald Trumps political opponents alleging ties_between Trump and Russia reached an agreement with the FBI a few_weeks before the election for the bureau to pay him to continue his work according to several people_familiar with the arrangementThe agreement to compensate former MI6 agent Christopher_Steele came as US intelligence_agencies reached a consensus that the Russians had interfered in the presidential_election by orchestrating hacks of Democratic_Party email accountsWhile Trump has derided the dossier as fake_news compiled by his political opponents the FBIs arrangement with Steele shows that the bureau considered him credible and found his information while unproved to be worthy of further investigationUltimately the FBI did_not pay Steele Communications between the bureau and the former spy were interrupted as Steeles now-famous dossier became the subject of news stories congressional inquiries and presidential denials according to the people_familiar with the arrangement who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matterAt the time of the October agreement FBI officials probing Russian activities including possible contacts_between Trump associates and Russian entities were aware of the information that Steele had been gathering while working for a Washington research firm hired by supporters of Democratic_nominee Hillary_Clinton according to the people_familiar with the agreement The firm was due to stop paying Steele as Election_Day approached but Steele felt his work was not done these people said Steele was familiar to the FBI in part because the bureau had previously hired him to help a US inquiry into alleged corruption in the The FBI sometimes pays informants sources and outside investigators to assist in its work Steele was known for the quality of his past work and for the knowledge he had developed over nearly 20 years working on Russia-related issues for British_intelligence The Washington_Post was not able to determine how_much the FBI intended to pay Steele had their relationship remained intactThe dossier he produced last_year alleged among other things that associates of Trump colluded with the Kremlin on cyberattacks on Democrats and that the Russians held compromising_material about the Republican nomineeThese and other explosive claims have not been verified and they have been by Trump and his alliesThe FBI as well as the Senate_Intelligence Committee is investigating Russian_interference in the election and alleged contacts_between Trumps associates and the KremlinOn Tuesday House Speaker Paul D Ryan (R-Wis) told_reporters that he had seen no_evidence so_far of Trump campaign contacts with Russia but said a bipartisan House inquiry would proceed so that no stone is unturnedThe revelation that the FBI agreed to pay Steele at the same_time he was being paid by Clinton supporters to dig into Trumps background could further strain relations between the law_enforcement agency and the White HouseA spokesman for the FBI declined to comment Steeles London-based attorney did_not respond to questions about the agreementWhite House_press secretary_Sean Spicer declined to

JuneSteeles information was provided by an intermediary to the FBI and US intelligence officials after the Democratic_National Convention in July when were first released by WikiLeaks according to a source familiar_with the events After the convention Steele contacted a friend in the FBI to personally explain what he had foundAs summer turned to fall Steele became concerned that the US government was not taking the information he had uncovered seriously enough according to two people_familiar with the situationIn October anticipating that funding supplied through the original client would dry up Steele and the FBI reached a spoken understanding He would continue his work looking at the Kremlins ties to Trump and receive compensation for his effortsBut Steeles frustration deepened when FBI_Director James_B Comey who had been silent on the Russia inquiry publicly 11_days before the election that the bureau was investigating a newly discovered cache of emails Clinton had exchanged using her private_server according to people_familiar with Steeles thinkingThose people say Steeles frustration with the FBI peaked after an Oct 31 New_York Times story that cited law_enforcement sources drawing conclusions that he considered premature The said that the FBI had not yet found any conclusive or direct link between Trump and the Russian_government and that the Russian hacking was not intended to help TrumpAfter the election the intelligence_community concluded that Russias interference had been intended to assist TrumpIn January top intelligence and law_enforcement officials briefed Trump and President_Barack Obama on those findings In_addition they provided a summary of the core allegations of Steeles dossier News of that briefing soon became public Then BuzzFeed posted a copy of Steeles salacious but unproven dossier online sparking outrage from TrumpIts all fake_news Its phony stuff It didnt happen Trump in January It was a group of opponents that got together sick people and they put that crap togetherHe later tweeted that Steele was a failed spyThe development marked the end of the FBIs relationship with SteeleAfter he was publicly identified by the Wall_Street Journal as the dossiers author Steele US officials took pains to stress that his report was not a US government product and that it had not influenced their broader conclusions that the Russian_government had hacked the emails of Democratic officials and released those emails with the intention of helping Trump win the presidencyThe [intelligence community] has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable and we did_not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions then-Director of National Intelligence James_R Clapper_Jr said in in JanuaryThe owner of a technology company identified in Steeles dossier as a participant in the hacks is now suing Steele and BuzzFeed for defamation BuzzFeed apologized to the executive and blocked out his name in the published documentComey spent almost two hours this month briefing the Senate_Intelligence Committee Democrats in the House have informally reached out to Steele in recent_weeks to ask about his willingness to testify or cooperate according to people_familiar with the requests Steele has so_far not responded they saidA federal_judge in Washington blocked the Trump Administrations proposed transgender military ban writing in a strongly worded opinion that the policy does_not appear to be supported by any factsUS District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly issued the preliminary injunction Monday finding that a group of transgender_service members would have a strong chance of prevailing in their lawsuit to have the ban declared unconstitutional The injunction remains in place until the lawsuit is resolved or a judge lifts itThe move is another legal setback for the president who surprised military leaders and members of Congress when he announced the proposal in late July that reversed an Obama_administration policy allowing transgender_service members to serve_openly and begin enlisting in JanuaryThe tweets were followed by a presidential directive and a plan set to take effect in March that would have blocked military recruitment of transgender_people and would have of current transgender_service membersThe judges injunction effectively reverts Trumps policy to the one issued under ObamaThe Obama_administration announced its policy after a Pentagon review found no basis to exclude transgender_people from the military after it examined medical care military readiness and other factorsThe Monday ruling was hailed by GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders (GLAD) and the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) who sued in August on behalf of six active-duty transgender_service members who had come out to their superiors and had roughly 60years combined in the military It was the first of to challenge the ban and the first significant ruling by a judge on Trumps policyThis is a complete victory for our plaintiffs and all transgender_service members who are now once_again able to serve on equal terms and without the threat of being discharged said NCLR Legal Director Shannon MinterDepartment of Justice spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam issued a statement saying the department is currently evaluating the next steps Department attorneys had previously asked for the suit to be dismissedPlaintiffs lawsuit challenging military service requirements is premature for many reasons including that the Defense_Department is actively reviewing such service requirements as the President ordered and because none of the Plaintiffs have established that they will be impacted by current policies on military service the statement read The six service_members in the lawsuit contended that their Fifth Amendment rights to equal protection were being violated a claim bolstered by three former Obama_administration service branch chiefs and a senior Pentagon official who offered statements saying the ban would harm readiness staffing recruitment and moraleKollar-Kotelly was unsparing in her ruling saying the hastily announced Trump policy did_not pass muster on many frontsThere is absolutely no support for the claim that the ongoing service of transgender_people would have any negative effect on the military at all In fact there is considerable evidence that it is the discharge and banning of such individuals that would have such effects Kollar-Kotelly wroteCarl Tobias a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law said the Trump administration would likely have to go all the way to the Supreme_Court to have any chance of getting the preliminary injunction nullifiedIf they go to the DC Circuit I cant imagine they are going to overturn this Tobias said The judge was strong in her opinion She just didnt see any support for the policy on the factsMore than a dozen states filed a brief in October supporting the arguments of the service_members in the case writing that Trump was pursuing an irrational return to discrimination in the military One aspect of the opinion that continued to be debated Monday was the barring of military funding for sex-reassignment surgery which is part of the banKollar-Kotellys order found that none of the plaintiffs had shown they were likely to be affected by that funding ban so the court was not in a position to rule on the propriety of this directiveTransgender advocates however insisted that the ruling allowed the military to continue to pay for such surgeries The Department of Justice declined to comment on its understanding of the ruling as it relates to the surgery issueThere is no official tally of transgender military members and estimates vary widely One recent study by the Rand_Corp put the number on active_duty at about 2500 while another from the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law estimated that there were 15500 on active_duty in the National Guard and in the reserves Currently allow transgender_troops to serve in the militaryTrumps proposal was cheered by many religious conservatives but outraged transgender advocates and many liberals Trump blindsided many when he announced the policy on TwitterAfter consultation with my_Generals and military experts_please be advised that the United_States Government will not accept or allow Transgender_individuals to serve in any capacity in the US Military Trump wrote in the tweets Our_military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous_medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entailLesbian gay and transgender advocates say the ban is part of a broader pattern of discrimination by the Trump administration This month Attorney_General Jeff_Sessions reversed a Justice_Department policy protecting transgender workers from discrimination under federal lawPresident Trump on Tuesday belittled former foreign_policy adviser George_Papadopoulos who pleaded_guilty this week to lying to federal agents investigating Russias interference in the 2016 election tweeting that few people knew the young low_level volunteer named George who has already proven to be a liarBut interviews and documents_show that Papadopoulos was in regular contact with the Trump campaigns most senior officials and held himself out as a Trump surrogate as he traveled the world to meet with foreign officials and reportersPapadopoulos sat at the elbow of one of Trumps top campaign advisers then-Sen Jeff_Sessions during a dinner for campaign advisers weeks before the Republican_National Convention according to an individual who attended the meeting He met in London in September 2016 with a mid-level representative of the British Foreign Office where he said he had contacts at the senior level of the Russian_government And he conferred at one point with the foreign_minister of Greece at a meeting in New YorkWhile some top campaign aides appeared to rebuff there is no sign they told him directly to cease his activities or sought to end his affiliation with the campaignEmails included in court_documents released Monday show that Papadopoulos repeatedly told Trump campaign officials about his contacts with people he believed were representing the Russian governmentThe court_documents do not answer a key question whether Papadopoulos also told his superiors that he had met a London-based professor who claimed to know that the Russians had dirt on Democratic candidate Hillary_Clinton including thousands of her emailsAn FBI agent told the court in July that Papadopoulos lied in an_interview with federal agents saying he did_not tell anyone on the campaign about the dirt because he thought the professor was a nothing At 29 Papadopoulos had scant experience that qualified him to advise a presidential_candidate He had entered the Trump campaign after a six-week stint working for the campaign of Trumps rival for the Republican nomination neurosurgeon Ben CarsonCarsons campaign_manager Barry Bennett recalled that Papadopoulos was hired after sending him an unsolicited message via LinkedIn seeking a jobAt the time Carsons campaign was desperate to show it had policy experts advising his campaign given that most leading Republican foreign_policy thinkers had been snapped up by other candidatesBennett said his only vetting was to ask a friend at the Washington-based Hudson Institute where Papadopouloss rsum indicated he had worked as a researcher whether Papadopoulos was an okay guyI wasnt looking for something stellar Bennett said I wanted to make_sure he was okayFor six weeks of work Bennett said Papadopoulos was paid $8500 before he was let go from the campaign at the end of January 2016 as it shed staffBy March_2016 Trumps campaign like Carsons before it was eagerly searching for foreign_policy expertise As Trump rose in the polls and won Republican primaries the former reality TV host was under pressure to announce a group of advisers with whom he was consulting on foreign_policy issuesThe scrutiny intensified early that month after 70 conservative national_security experts signed an open letter opposing Trumps candidacy In mid-March Trump was asked on the MSNBC show Morning Joe to name people with whom he spoke about foreign affairs Im speaking with myself number one because I have a very good brain Trump responded prompting more calls for a list of formal advisersTo come up with names the campaign turned to Sam_Clovis a former Iowa radio_host who served as national campaign co-chairman an attorney for Clovis confirmed Tuesday in a statementBut the statement did_not address how Papadopoulos ended up on the list Bennett said he was not consulted and would not have recommended his former employee if he had been asked because he found him unimpressiveOn March 21 Trump included Papadopoulos among five men he announced were advising him on matters of national_security in a meeting with The Washington_Post editorial board An energy and oil consultant Excellent guy Trump said If Trump or his team had undertaken even a cursory vetting of Papadopoulos they would have found that much of his already-slim rsum was either exaggerated or falseWhile he claimed to have served for several years as a fellow at the Hudson Institute officials there said he had been an unpaid intern and a researcher under contract to several fellows who were writing a bookAlthough he claimed to be US Representative at the 2012 Geneva International Model United_Nations officials at that organization said they had no record of him Papadopoulos said he had delivered the keynote address at a leading American-Greek organization in 2008 while a student at DePaul University But records from the gathering indicate he merely participated in a youth panel with other participants The keynote was delivered by 1988 Democratic presidential_candidate Michael DukakisThough Papadopouloss exaggerated rsum issues quickly became public he remained a part of the Trump advisory panel and soon began urging campaign aides to let him set_up a meeting between Trump and Russian officialsCourt documents_show he raised the idea at a March 31 meeting of the group attended by both Trump and Sessions who had endorsed Trumps campaign telling the group that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President [Vladimir] PutinHe also began appearing in the foreign press While visiting Israel the next month he told a group of researchers that Trump saw Putin as a responsible actor and potential partner according to a column in the Jerusalem PostIn May he told the Telegraph of London that Prime_Minister David Cameron should apologize to Trump for calling the candidate divisive stupid and wrong Camerons comments had come after Trump announced that he supported a ban on Muslims entering the United StatesPapadopouloss comments were big news in Britain and the campaign took notice JD Gordon a former Pentagon spokesman and Trump national_security adviser said campaign officials were displeased and Papadopoulos was counseled that he should clear future media appearances with campaign staff and keep a low profileI was surprised to learn what George_Papadopoulos was up to during the campaign he said Tuesday in a text message He obviously went to great lengths to go around me and Sen SessionsAnd yet Papadopoulos continued to be invited to campaign events In late June or early July he attended a dinner at the Capitol_Hill Club along with several other national_security advisers for the Trump campaign Another person who was at the meeting said Sessions also attended Papadopoulos was seated to Sessionss leftA spokeswoman for Sessions declined to commentMedia appearances by Papadopoulos continued In September he spoke extensively to Interfax telling the Russian news_agency that Trump has been open about his willingness to usher in a new chapter in US-Russia relations depending on Russia acting as a responsible stake holder in the international system He also questioned the effectiveness of US sanctions on RussiaBy that time WikiLeaks had released emails hacked from the Democratic_National Committee that were widely suspected to have been stolen at the direction of the Russian_government Trumps warm rhetoric toward Putin had become a controversial topic on the campaign trailCourt documents_show that Papadopoulos forwarded a copy of the Interfax article to a Russian woman with whom he had been corresponding during the campaign British sources said it was around that time that he approached British government officials to say he was traveling to London and asked to be given a meeting with senior government ministers Instead he was offered a session with a mid-level official at the Foreign Office in LondonDuring the meeting Papadopoulos made a comment indicating he had contacts at the senior level of the Russian_government British sources said British officials quickly concluded he was not a major or knowledgeable player in the Trump orbit and did_not pursue the issue or continue contactA spokesman for the Greek Embassy said he met with that nations foreign_minister in New_York Spokesman Efthymios Aravantinos said the conversation was conducted as part of a routine effort that the embassy makes to reach out to Greek Americans hoping they have a sentimental attachment to Greece and that we can connectIt is not clear how_much the campaign knew about Papadopouloss activities But he continued through these months to have contact with other Trump officialsIn September Papadopoulos_emailed another Trump aide Boris Epshteyn and told him he planned to be in New_York and hoped to set_up meetings around the UN General Assembly meetingThe email was in August of this year and is among 20000 pages of documents that the Trump campaign has turned over to the White_House Congressional committees and defense attorneysPapadopoulos wrote that he wanted to connect Epshteyn with a friend Sergei Millian of the Russian American_Chamber of Commerce the emails saidMillian would later be identified as a major source for the author of a dossier that included unsubstantiated salacious allegations about Trumps activities in Russia a claim Millian has denied Epshteyn said he never_met Millian and declined to comment further Asked in August to describe his relationship with Papadopoulos Millian responded by email I can meet and talk to any person Its none of your businessMillian did_not respond to a request for comment TuesdayPapadopoulos continued to hold himself out as a Trump adviser even after the November election Two days after Trumps inauguration in January he met in Washington with a group of Israelis headed by Yossi Dagan a leader of the West Bank settler movement that prepared a video of the session to be shown at homeWe had an excellent meeting with Yossi and we hope that the people of Judea and Samaria the name used by the Israeli right for the West Bank will have a great 2017 Papadopoulos said according to the video We are looking forward to ushering in a new relationship with all of IsraelAccording to an account in the Jerusalem Post the settler leaders had been invited to attend the inauguration and meet with senators congressmen and members of the Presidents team Dagan reached by telephone Tuesday in Israel declined to comment on the visit or who had arranged the meeting with Papadopoulos While the president now seems to have left Papadopoulos behind Papadopoulos has continued to highlight the tie On LinkedIn he indicates he was a Trump adviser through January 2017 and includes the experience as the first line of his description about himselfPresident Trump recommendation about me George is an oil and gas consultant excellent guy Papadopoulos wrote Dan Balz Sari Horwitz and Devlin_Barrett in Washington and Ruth Eglash in Jerusalem contributed to this reportOn Sunday morning President Trump expressed frustration that his campaign is under investigation

that work was for other legal matters and how_much of it related to Fusion_GPS Its unclear how Trump arrived at the $12 million figure used in his tweets When it comes to the Uranium to Russia deal

increased Russias share of the US nuclear market At the same_time the House Oversight Committee has launched a that will examine among other things why then-FBI Director_James B Comeypublicly

Cuban American heritage on the 2016 campaign_trail Gillespies Irish grandfather came to America because he found work as a janitor he saidMy parents worked on their feet all day long in the grocery store Gillespie said [Rubios] parents worked on their feet all day long His mother was a hotel maid His father was a bartender He too is the son of immigrantsWe appreciate and understand the importance of the American Dream because our parents have seen it here firsthand he saidThen he introduced Rubio but just before the senator took the stage an activist jumped up on the stage holding a sign protesting deportations Sheriffs deputies quickly hustled her out of the building as the audience clappedWithin minutes Rubio alluded to the immigration controversy telling the crowd that Gillespie would work for them no matter where your family came from or how your last name is pronouncedRubio said he too comes from a community affected by gang_violence and said it would make no sense to ignore MS-13 in a state impacted by the gangThat would be like talking_about organized crime but refusing to talk about the Mafia he said to chuckles from supportersLater he joked about his common Irish heritage with Gillespie which is why they call him Marc ORubioIn our veins runs the blood of people who are go-getters of someone from somewhere who refused to accept the restrictions

his supporters was two-term Rep Barbara Comstock (R) who spoke on behalf of Gillespie at the start of the hour-long rallyLast month that would expand the federal governments powers to deport or detain noncitizen immigrants who are gang_members or are suspected of gang activityThe bill drew the ire of immigrant rights groups including those who protested the Gillespie rallyBefore the rally activists from left-leaning organizations CASA in Action People for the American Way and Indivisible chanted Back up back up We want freedom freedom All these racist politicians we dont need them need themMany of them held signs saying Gillespie Racist beneath a black-and-white photo of Gillespie with a red line through itLuis Aguilar a community organizer with CASA in Action who lives in Alexandria said Gillespie cannot who stumped for him last_week and profess to understand the immigrant experienceThose politicians absolutely do not exemplify the regular Latino the regular immigrant he said Who are they The elite He is showing us that he is an establishment Republican seeking to be Trump Jr as wellLizet Ocampo the political director for People for the American Way who is based in the District said Gillespie is trying to win the election based on racism and fearHe is using racist imagery and language to send his message she said When he shows images of Latino-looking people and says Fear them this is the same thing Trump did when he went down the escalator and said Mexicans are drug dealers and rapists and criminals Exactly the same campaign strategyAs protesters chanted Yes we can Rick Canton of Sterling yelled back Detain No you cant and Not a chanceCanton a first-generation Cuban American who was among the local GOP activists endorsing Rubio during the primary later said he

on CNN ManafortMSNBC ManafortFox News Hamburger emoji Roberto Ferdman (@robferdman)For three hours Saturday Rep Darrell Issa (R-Calif) endured pointed questions jeers and derisive laughter during two successive town halls in this northern suburb of San DiegoBut this wasnt just a moment for Issa to let anxious constituents vent their worries about immigration policy health-care reform or the first seven weeks of President Trumps tenure It was a major first test of the Democratic Partys efforts to turn antipathy toward Trump into electoral gains in 2018 It was also a chance for Issa to show that he is willing to stand apart from Trump for a district that has rapidly grown more liberal in recent yearsI do not work for the executive_branch Issa said in an opening statement Saturday at one of two morning town hall meetings at a community center here I investigated the Obama_administration I also investigated the Bush administrationIssa 63 has been distancing himself from Trump for some time Widely seen as a partisan flamethrower during his years leading the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and its many investigations of the Obama_administration Issa is more likely these days to defend the budget of the Environmental Protection_Agency or to demand a rigorous investigation_into allegations of Russian intervention in the 2016 electionHe has good reason to moderate Californias 49th Congressional District which encompasses the increasingly diverse and liberal suburban cities in northern San Diego County and southern Orange County is no_longer the safely Republican terrain that it was for Issas first eight elections to CongressLast year Issa won narrowly against a lawyer and retired Marine colonel Douglas Applegate who has announced plans to challenge him again in 2018 Last week environmental lawyer Mike Levin another Democrat announced that he too plans to challenge IssaOn Saturday one questioner noted that some Democrats have wondered whether Trump is too emotionally unstable to be trusted with nuclear weaponsIssas answer stopped short of a full-throated show of support for the new commander in chief If the issue comes up in front of the appropriate body he said I will vote my conscienceYet Issas attempts to distance himself from Trump were met with derision and boos When he referred to Russian President_Vladimir Putin as an evil son of a blank who sows chaos and then capitalizes on it an audience member yelled so does Trump The crowd cheeredA protester outside the community center held a sign that seemed to sum up the attitude of many if not most of the more_than 1000 who attended the two sessions Repeal and Replace the PresidentOne man wore a Russian military hat Another wore a T-shirt that read Trump-Putin 16 A woman held a sign Russia-Gate Follow the Money Another had a shirt signaling that she is a nasty woman a jibe Trump aimed_at Hillary_Clinton during a presidential campaign debateBetween the two sessions a reporter asked Issa whether he is worried about the 2018 congressional election becoming a referendum on TrumpI dont care he said Fact is that Im_going to be with Trump sometimes against him sometimesOnly a few of Issas colleagues held town hall meetings after Congresss workweek ended but questions about the American Health Care_Act as the House GOP plan to replace the Affordable_Care Act is known were rampant Rep Douglas A Collins (R-Ga) a supporter of the bill was confronted in a Friday night tele-town hall by a man named Bill who demanded that Republicans pass the repeal package of 2015 That has been the plan favored by Sen Rand Paul (R-Ky) and most of the conservative House Freedom Caucus Collins assured the constituent that the 2015 bill is in this package thats going to be sent to the president which is not true as the AHCA keeps some parts of the ACA that Republicans formerly voted to repealRep Ron DeSantis (R-Fla) a Freedom Caucus member whose district backed Trump by 17points told a morning crowd in St Augustine that he wasnt ready to back the billI dont_think you can come to grips with the bill in 36 hours I dont DeSantis said Im not sure it does enough to lower the costs of health careDeSantis was booed when he praised the idea of expanding health savings accounts a part of the GOPs plans he also said that a viral moment from a CNN interview he did where he appeared to be saying that cancer patients could get coverage at emergency rooms was misinterpreted He was received more sympathetically when he criticized the bill saying that as structured it might lead to higher premiumsIf you do it right people are going to have access to cheaper plans DeSantis said If you dont Im not sure its going to reduce costsIssa faced questions about the Affordable_Care Act too He did_not fully buy into the current GOP plan being promoted by House Speaker Paul D Ryan (R-Wis) But he didnt help himself with many in the crowd when he referred to the ACA as Obamacare which prompted the audience to boo and cry out the Affordable_Care ActIssa responded sharply Hey its not affordableAs at so many other town halls across the country in recent_weeks no one asked Issa about local issues not even about a recent deployment of Marines from nearby Camp Pendleton to Syria That suggests that the electorate is primed to turn the 2018 election into a referendum on Trump something of which Democrats are likely to try to take advantageAfter last years squeaker election in the 49th District Democrats listed Issa as among the most vulnerable Republican incumbents in 2018 The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has hired a full-time organizer in the district In response the GOP campaign committee has included Issa among 10 House incumbents who will receive additional help from the partyWhile most of the crowd Saturday was markedly anti-Trump a smattering of the presidents supporters were present some wearing the red Make America Great Again campaign hats A bare-chested man outside held a sign asking Whats Not To Like about Trumps viewsRepeatedly Issa asked questioners to be succinct and implored the rest of the audience to not drown out the question or answer His goal for the meeting was modest he joked with the crowdThe only thing I ask is that it not end like [the play] Hamilton he said referring to Alexander Hamiltons untimely death in a duel with Aaron Burr David Weigel in Fort Lauderdale Fla contributed to this reportWikiLeaks released yet_another batch of hacked emails from inside Hillary_Clintons campaign Wednesday and with them came another_round of embarrassing headlines and new glimpses of internal anxiety over the candidates weaknessesRepublican Donald Trump and his allies seized on the emails which reveal comments by an aide about Catholics a line from a paid speech in which Clinton might be seen as playing down the threat of terrorism and an internal dispute over potential conflicts of interest posed by the Clinton FoundationThe drip-drip-drip of damaging attention is likely to continue WikiLeaks the anti-secrecy organization began releasing new messages last Friday from the personal email account of Clintons campaign_chairman John_Podesta and has promised to issue tens of thousands moreThe correspondence reveals a campaign that has struggled all year to improve a flawed candidate As far back as March aides were keenly aware that she was resistant to the media perhaps out of touch with regular Americans and unable to convey a clear message to votersA month before Clinton launched her campaign her aides worked to corral her well-known love for granular policy details into a message that would both capture her agenda and present a forward-looking aspirational vision for her presidencyNearly a year later a similar struggle cropped up as they attempted to revise her core campaign messageDo we have any sense from her what she believes or wants her core message to be asked Clinton adviser Joel BenensonBenenson contrasted the simplicity of Bernie Sanderss anti-Wall Street message with Clintons multitiered campaign slogansSeven months later and on the cusp of Election_Day the concerns laid out in these emails and others largely remain Clinton has proven to be a lackluster candidate who has struggled to win over the liberals who gravitated to Sanders during the primary and who remains ahead in large part due to Trumps historic weaknessesRight now I am petrified that Hillary is almost totally dependent on Republicans nominating Trump Brent Budowsky a political columnist and former political adviser wrote in a March_2016 email to Podesta and Roy Spence an ad maker for the campaign She has huge endemic political weaknesses that she would be wise to rectifyEven a clown like Ted_Cruz would be an even money bet to beat and this scares the hell of out me Budowsky addedIndeed at_least one aide Benenson believed that Marco_Rubio posed the greatest threat to Clinton if he were to become the Republican nomineeHovering over the trickle of embarrassing emails are suspicions both within the Clinton campaign and in intelligence circles that Russia is behind the hack The FBI is investigating the cyber incident as part of a broader inquiry into Russian hacking of political organizations such as the Democratic_National Committee law_enforcement officials said Clinton and her allies have linked the hacking to an attempt by the Russians to influence an American electionBy dribbling these out every day WikiLeaks is proving they are nothing but a propaganda arm of the Kremlin with a political agenda doing Putins dirty work to help elect Donald Trump said Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin The FBI is now investigating this crime The unanswered questions are why Donald Trump strangely wont condemn it and whether any of his associates are involvedRegardless the emails are likely to be a source of headaches for Clinton from now until Election_Day The Clinton campaign has declined to confirm the authenticity of the emails nor has it denied itAt a Wednesday afternoon rally in Lakeland Fla Trump called the WikiLeaks revelations big stuff and repeatedly slammed his Democratic rival over themThe Hillary_Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how_much is at stake on Nov 8 She would be the most dishonest and the most corrupt person ever elected to high office Trump told the crowdHis campaign held a conference call with reporters singling out an exchange showing campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri describing people who convert to CatholicismI imagine they think it is the most socially acceptable politically conservative religion their rich friends wouldnt understand if they became evangelicals Palmieri wrote according to WikiLeaks Palmieri who is Catholic said Wednesday aboard Clintons campaign plane that she has no recollection of the emailHouse Speaker Paul D Ryan (R-Wis) seized on the email in a statement denouncing the Clinton campaigns disdain for the Catholic faith although he cited a portion of the email not written by Palmieri or any other Clinton staffer The emails also show the campaigns internal struggle with how best to address the controversy surrounding the use of an email_server while Clinton was at the State_Department and her resistance to her aides counsel about how best to but the issue asideIn March 2015 Nick Merrill now Clintons traveling press_secretary wrote to Palmieri suggesting that Clinton sit down with comedian and writer Larry Wilmore who was already scheduled to appear with Bill and Chelsea Clinton at a Clinton Global Initiative eventHRC is not slated to join but maybe she should Merrill wrote suggesting Wilmore could make a joke about hearing Hillary_Clinton is a big emailer As the email issue persisted top aide Huma Abedin asked Clintons advisers in May 2015 whether Clinton could survive not answering questions from press at events during the first leg of the campaign when she rolled out new policyIn the fall starting to do avails at message events interviews and Q and A with press but having had a series of policy proposals already announced and reported on that she could point to Abedin suggested seemingly to relay Clintons thinking to a number of top aidesPodesta disagreed in no uncertain termsIf she thinks we can get to Labor Day without taking press questions I_think thats suicidal Podesta wrote We have to find some mechanism to let the stream out of the pressure cookerA similar debate re-emerged in 2016 after Clinton went months without answering questions from her traveling press only to change course after Labor Day with more frequent news conferencesStill unable to lay the email issue to rest in 2015 Clintons aides talked about their effort to persuade Clinton to use the decision to turn over her server to the Justice_Department as an opportunity for her to be seen as having dealt with the issueIt is clear that she is not in same place (unless John has a convo with her and gets her in a different place) Palmieri wrote in August 2015To this day Clintons email_server is a major part of Trumps case against her and is regularly cited by voters as among the reasons they dont trust herThe battle with Sanders also proved challenging Campaign aides sought to balance the need to reduce the damage his candidacy did to hers by bringing the primary to an end while also not alienating his liberal supporters whom she planned to rely in during the general electionIn the wake of Sanderss resounding defeat of Clinton in the New Hampshire primary the emails show top Clinton advisers discussing ways to slow the momentum of the senator from Vermont a self-described democratic socialistIn one email Clinton adviser Mandy Grunwald discusses several possible lines of attack including one under the header FREE STUFF FOR EVERYBODYCombined Sanders proposals would put the government in control of more_than half of the American economy but Sanders has never told anyone who would pay for all of this or how it would work she wroteOthers warned against attacking Sanders too hard and risking turning away his supportersThe emails show that Clintons campaign also worried about the influence of Sen Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) over the left wing of the party and the possibility that she might endorse SandersIn October 2015 as Sanders was attracting huge crowds on the campaign_trail Grunwald asked whether Clinton should modify her views on a proposed banking regulation to mollify WarrenI am still worried that we will antagonize and activate Elizabeth Warren by opposing a new Glass-Steagall Grunwald wrote I worry about defending the banks in the debateAn excerpt of one of Clintons paid speeches show some aides were concerned that her comments seemed like an admission that she is out of touchAnd Clinton mused about her own shortcomings and challenges with being a more authentic candidate in an off-the-record interview she had with New_York Times journalist Mark Leibovich in the summer of 2015Im trying to let people into my_life she said according to the transcript Im trying to relate to people not relate to them you know talk about being a grandmother talk about you know the experiences I had growing up and all that Talk about my own mother And in that way kind of make connectionsThe leaked emails also offer a glimpse of the often plodding nature of her campaign While Trump often speaks off the cuff and his staff doesnt even know some of what hell say most everything Clinton does is scriptedOn an email chain in October 2015 that included more_than a dozen aides there was great debate over whether Clinton should tell a joke at an Iowa dinner about her grueling 11-hour testimony before a House panel investigating the Benghazi attackAs described the joke which was apparently suggested by Bill_Clinton involved the former secretary of state half-expecting Sanders to burst in during hour eight of her testimony and repeat his famous debate line Enough about your damn emails HillaryIn the end the line never saw the light of dayI defer if others think this buys us good will with Sanders people Podesta wrote But email jokes in Iowa usually end up badly and dont we want to move on Anu Narayanswamy Sean Sullivan Carol Morello and Ellen_Nakashima contributed to this reportWhen BuzzFeed published that now-infamous dossier of unproven claims about Donald Trump and Russia in January former Hillary_Clinton campaign aides expressed outrage that news outletsthat had obtained the dossier before Election_Day did_not make its contents public in time to influence voters and Clinton lateraired the same grievancein her book about the presidential raceIt turns out that the reaction of the Democratic presidential_nominee and her team was disingenuous The Washington_Post reported on Tuesday night that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic_National Committee helpedfund the dossier compiled by a former_British intelligence_officer through a law_firm hired to conduct opposition researchThe Clinton camp left out its own role in the dossiers creation as it ripped the media for sitting on information that journalists had been unable to verify What Clinton and her advisers presented as their judgment that themedia had made the wrong call was in fact their frustration at having failed to plant negative news reports before ballots were cast Recall that BuzzFeed published the dossier in full on Jan 10 after CNN reported that the FBI had briefed President_Barack Obama and then-President-elect Trump on its contents Many journalists criticized BuzzFeeds decision arguing that news_outlets should not spread claims they cant corroborate even if the FBI considers the claims significant enough to share with the president and his soon-to-be successorBut Clinton press aides Brian_Fallon and Nick Merrill contended on Twitter that the real journalistic malpractice was not publishing information contained in the dossier earlierThis was long rumored during the campaign and many reporters know at_least some of what Russia was alleged to have Brian_Fallon (@brianefallon) Today has brought a gush of reporting that outlets knew about and sat on prior to November 8cc Brian_Fallon (@brianefallon) I repeat certain media outlets were told this prior to November 8 Brian_Fallon (@brianefallon) In fact if we want to get specific one outlet a very very prominent outlet threw cold water on this when Slate beat them to the punch Nick Merrill (@NickMerrill) Merrill was referring to the New_York Times which on Oct 31 2016 that the FBI had chased a lead which they ultimately came to doubt about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump_Organization to a Russian bank Journalist Franklin Foer had reported on the possible secret channel earlier that dayAlso that day Mother Jones magazine that a former senior intelligence_officer for a Western countryhadprovided the [FBI] with memos based on his recent interactions with Russian sources contending the Russian_government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trump and that the FBI requested more information from him The memos comprised the dossier that BuzzFeed later publishedConsistent with the Mother Jones report the Times reported that intelligence officials have said in interviews over the last six weeks that apparent connections between some of Mr Trumps aides and Moscow originally compelled them to open a broad investigation_into possible links_between the Russian_government and the Republican presidential candidateStill the Times added throwing the cold water Merrill spoke of they have said that Mr Trump himself has not become a target And no_evidence has emerged that would link him or anyone_else in his business or political circle directly to Russias election operationsClinton complained about the Times report in her post-election book What HappenedIn the summer of 2016 according to The Washington_Post the FBI convinced a special Foreign_Intelligence Surveillance Court that there was probably cause to believe that Trump adviser Carter_Page was acting as a Russian agent and the received a warrant to monitor his communications The FBI also began investigating a dossier prepared by a well-respected former_British spy that contained explosive and salacious allegations about compromising_information the Russians had on Trump The intelligence_community took the dossier seriously enough that it briefed both President Obama and President-elect Trump on its contents before the inaugurationSources within the FBI also convinced the New_York Times to run a story saying they saw no clear link to Russia countering Franklin Foers scoop in Slate about unusual computer traffic between Trump_Tower and a Russian bankNote that Clinton described the dossier only as having been prepared by a well-respected former_British spy as if the spy Christopher_Steele had acted on his own Clinton certainly gave no_indication that her campaign helped finance his workThere is a fundamental contradiction here Clinton wanted the dossier to be viewed as credible yet she did_not want to be connected to it She hoped the media before Election_Day would publish claims about Trump to which she was unwilling to attach her own nameThe nations capital lost out on hosting the Gay_Games 2022 to Hong_Kong the federation of Gay_Games announced Monday afternoon Mayor Muriel_E Bowser (D) and 23 city

reporting whats really going on Clinton said adding It appears they dont_know Im not presidentPaul Manafort known to his friends as having a pricey lifestyle with tailored suits choice seats at Yankee Stadium and a house in the Hamptons appeared to experience some turbulence in 2004A Florida horse farm he owned with his wife faced the threat of foreclosure according to property records and he used his Virginia house as collateral for a quarter-million-dollar loan After bursting on the Washington scene in the 1970s and 1980s working for the likes of Gerald R Ford Ronald_Reagan and George_HW Bush his political consulting career had largely disappeared from viewIn 2005 Manaforts fortunes seemed to improveHe signed on as an adviser to a Ukrainian steel magnate who according to people who worked there with Manafort connected him with one of the countrys most_powerful politicians Viktor_Yanukovych Back home corporations linked to Manafort purchased a unit in Trump_Tower for $37million and then two other high-priced apartments in New_York while Manafort and his wife bought a new house in FloridaThis spring Manafort returned to the US spotlight from the wilderness of Eastern European politics and business to run Republican Donald Trumps presidential campaign Manafort was considered a steady professional who could stabilize the chaotic operation while the campaign offered him a chance to reclaim a major role in US politics Manaforts reentry sputtered this week as Trump diminished his role selecting two other strategists to take charge even as Manafort retained his title of chairmanThe campaign shake-up followed reports this week that Manaforts name had surfaced in an inquiry by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of UkraineThe agency has been investigating claims that Yanukovych who won the presidency with Manaforts help in 2010 and others aligned with his Party of Regions stole up to $100billion in assets before Yanukovych fled to Russia in 2014Investigators said this week that they discovered a black ledger showing that $127million had been designated for Manafort between 2007 and 2012 by Yanukovychs party The anti-corruption agency published a list Thursday on its page of the alleged payments showing 22 installments assigned to ManafortManafort issued a strong denial this week in response to reports of the alleged payments saying that he never received a single off-the-books cash payment and that he never represented the governments of Ukraine or Russia He said his firm received payments for political work in the country and called the alleged secret cash payments first reported by the New_York Times unfounded silly and nonsensicalNeither Manafort nor his attorney responded to requests for further commentThe discovery of the ledger could trigger scrutiny of Manaforts connections to Ukraine by FBI officials who have been on the ground in Kiev working under a June agreement with the anti-corruption agencyFBI officials declined to comment on the specifics of the agencys involvement Peter Carr a spokesman said that we remain committed to helping recover stolen assets on behalf of the people of UkraineManaforts 2005 entry into Ukrainian politics and finances came when he signed on as an adviser to the steel magnate Rinat Akhmetov one of Ukraines richest oligarchs and a key supporter of Yanukovych and the Party of Regions according to interviews with Ukrainians and Americans who worked with ManafortManaforts first job was to burnish the local and international reputation of a company owned by Akhmetov based in the Russian-speaking industrial Donetsk regionAkhmetov was one of several oligarchs involved with the Party of Regions which was led largely by men who made a quick fortune after the Soviet_Union dissolved and Ukraine became a financial free-for-allThe report said that a third of the 50 wealthiest oligarchs in Ukraine belonged to the party and together had an estimated wealth of $354billion according to a report by the private intelligence firm StratforOver time Manaforts role with the party expanded He was tasked with rehabilitating the image of the partys leader Yanukovych who had been imprisoned twice according to people_familiar with Manaforts work thereIt was in the words of John E Herbst the US ambassador at the time an extreme makeover according to a cable he sent Washington that was subsequently published by the WikiLeaks organizationManafort and half a dozen businessmen lawyers and political analysts involved in Ukraine at the time brought discipline and focus that the Yanukovych-led campaigns had lackedHe got Yanukovych to comb his hair better to stay on message during public appearances and to adopt the kind of sharp rhetoric that had worked so well for Manaforts mentor Republican strategist Lee AtwaterPaul gave the team a belief in victory said Hanna Herman a former press_secretary and close adviser to Yanukovych That was his higher purpose Then all the professional American tactics he brought also helpedTaras Chornovil a former member of the Party of Regions recalled in an_interview how Manafort provided image consulting to Yanukovych and members of his party during the parliamentary elections of 2006 and 2007 seeking to soften the edges of politicians from the rough industrial cities in Ukraines southeastHe drilled them on talking_points and told them what suits to wearHe tried to control everything Chornovil recalled How people who represented the party would be dressed the words they said their makeup and the stylists Every small detailYevgen Kopachko a pollster who worked with Yanukovych on parliamentary and presidential campaigns said that Manafort had a phenomenal ability to work with sociological informationUkrainian political consultants said that Yanukovych grew to trust Manafort and that Yanukovychs victory in the 2010 presidential_election was considered proof that Manaforts approach was successfulSince Yanukovych became president that means he worked pretty effectively said Boris Kolesnikov a former Party of Regions lawmaker and Yanukovych allyIn Washington Manafort and his team met with State_Department officials and other opinion leaders to convince them that Yanukovych was a pro-Western democrat who supported NATO and was willing to work more closely with Washington said several colleagues and former US officials Manafort tried to influence US officials into thinking that Yanukovych was redeemable a guy who could be oriented toward the West said one former senior State_Department official who met with him at the time and spoke on the condition of anonymityManafort did_not however register as a foreign agent or as a lobbyist in Washington for his work with Ukraine Two well-known Washington firms that helped with the Ukrainian lobbying effort Mercury LLC and the Podesta_Group registered as lobbyists but not as foreign agentsAlthough it is common for US political consultants to work for overseas candidates and political parties ethics_experts say that anyone who is directly paid by a foreign government or political party for work in the United_States must register as a foreign agent under the Foreign_Agents Registration_Act Officials at Mercury a Republican-leaning firm and Podesta a Democratic-oriented firm led by Tony_Podesta the brother of Hillary_Clinton adviser John D Podesta said they received signed assurances that the money they received came from a Brussels-based nonprofit called the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine not from any government or political party The two lobbying_firms whose work linked to Manafort was first reported by the registered under the Lobbying Disclosure Act rather_than the Foreign_Agents Registration_Act on the advice of an attorney Had the firms been advised that the foreign-agent registry was appropriate we would have gladly registered under FARA said Kimberley Fritts chief_executive of the Podesta GroupAs Manafort built a political consulting practice in Ukraine he also developed financial connections with wealthy figures in the region some of whom face ongoing scrutiny from the Justice DepartmentIn 2008 he tried to develop an $850million Manhattan luxury apartment project with Dmitry Firtash a Ukrainian energy tycoon with a history of legal trouble US prosecutors charged Firtash in 2013 with money-laundering and bribery as part of a broad international corruption investigation and have sought his extradition although Firtashs attorneys have called the effort politically motivatedManaforts alleged role in the deal was detailed in documents submitted as part of a 2011 New_York lawsuit that accused Firtash of working with Manafort and others to invest ill-gotten profits from energy transactions in Ukraine Manafort denied wrongdoing and the case against Manafort and Firtashs energy company ultimately was dismissedIn another business venture Oleg_Deripaska a Russian aluminum_magnate accused Manafort in a court in the Cayman Islands of taking nearly $19million intended for investments then not accounting for the money returning it or responding to numerous inquiries about exactly how the money was usedIn his legal filing Deripaska said he expected that the money would be used to make acquisitions in Russia Ukraine and other countries in eastern and southern Europe Instead the petition argues the partnership made only one purchase buying a stake in Ukrainian cable television and Internet ventures Deripaska squeezed by the 2008 credit crunch asked for the partnership to be liquidated and his money returned according to Deripaskas petition But the filing said it was unclear who was controlling the Ukrainian cable TV and Internet assets and what_happened to the money Deripaska initially provided Richard Hibey Manaforts attorney did_not respond to repeated Washington_Post requests for comment on the current status of the disputeManaforts financial connections to the region along with those of other top Trump advisers have fueled concerns among US national_security experts about Trumps foreign_policy positions which included praising Russian President_Vladimir Putin and expressing some doubt about the US commitment to NATO countries that have not paid their share of defense costsAs the controversy regarding Manafort and Ukraine swelled this week Manafort said he had cut his ties with his Ukrainian client in 2014But colleagues in Kiev and Moscow said he continued to work for the Party of Regions now called the Opposition Bloc led by Yanukovychs former chief of staff and was seen in the country as recently as last yearHe was with the Opposition Bloc said one colleague who said he saw him in Kiev in October adding that Manafort said he was in Kiev to negotiate for money he was owed for consulting with the new partyUkrainian business registration records reviewed by The_Post show that Manafort

Anu Narayanswamy in Washington contributed to this reportIf President Trump is the finicky client describing what he wants for a monstrous wall-building project along the Mexican border Stephen Colbert is the flummoxed architect trying to fashion a blueprint from his bombastic adjectivesOn The Late_Show Friday night Colbert assembled a team of builders to come up with a ballpark estimate of how_much it would cost to erect the presidents promised wallThe answer a lot based on Trumps descriptionsThat wall is going to be so big and so strong and so powerful then-candidate Trump said at a campaign stop in Holderness NHImpenetrable physical tall powerful he said in another speechWe know the length of the United_States southern border about 2000miles Colbert said and Trump gave people watching the GOP debate in Houston a sense of how tall it would be A heck of a lot taller than the ceiling youre looking atThat was all Colbert needed to pull out his whiteboard and start in on some simple calculations Colberts efforts are a comedic version of what builders have been doing since Trump was elected after making campaign promises about a massive border wallUS Customs and Border Protection has said it plans to start awarding contracts for the wall by mid-April Concept papers were due Friday its unclear_whether Colbert submitted oneThe candidate field will be narrowed by March 20 and finalists would submit offers with their proposed costs by March 24Trump has suggested the wall would cost $12 billion the AP reported Republican leaders say it would cost between $12 billion and $15 billion although an internal Department of Homeland_Security report for Secretary John_F Kelly said the final total could reach $21 billion Colberts estimate came in a heck of a lot higher 200 million cubic yards of wall his team of builders concluded would mean $400 billion just for concreteThat number more_than doubled to $985 billion when the team factored in other costs 12000 workers portable concrete plants a road next to the wall and the cost of draining swamps along the borderTotal cost $2 trillionBut that doesnt account for another of Trumps adjectives beautiful Beautifying the border wall would take something like 100 million rolls of wallpaper one of Colberts experts estimatedClearly the costs were adding up Fortunately at_least for the United_States Trump has announced where he would send the billAnd Colbert had the Mexican Consulate on speed dialThis is Stephen Colbert from The Late_Show he told the woman who answered the phone Were trying to come up with just some rough numbers Obviously dont hold my feet to the fire over this but weve got a rough number of $2 trillion to build the border wall and I was wondering if you had that in petty cash right nowFor hundreds of years this small-scale city in Englands industrial north has been synonymous with pottery colorful plates bowls and tiles fired by workers in the heat of the local kilns and sold in fine ceramics shops the world overBut come Thursday Stoke-on-Trent could be known less for shaping crockery than for smashing itThe British political order virtually unchanged for a century as the Conservative and Labour parties have traded control is under threat of a populist-infused realignment as the UK Independence Party seeks to capitalize on its success inHaving helped to push Britain toward the departure lounge of the European_Union the anti-immigration UKIP is now seeking to displace Labour as the countrys natural home for working-class votersAnd a Thursday election here to fill a vacant parliamentary seat while minor in the overall calculus of British power could be a telling indicator of just how far the countrys politics have shifted in Brexits wakeTo the right-wing UKIP the seat represents a prime opportunity to break through with working-class voters who have for decades habitually backed the center-left Labour Party but who feel increasingly disconnected from the partys cosmopolitan white-collar outlookKnown for its pottery the area is blessed with exceptional clay Stoke still produces vast quantities But its once-burgeoning coal industry has disappeared and the areas tidy central shopping district is pocked with vacant storefrontsLike Rust Belt residents who helped deliver the White_House to Donald Trump Stokes working class last_year defied the pleas of Labour leaders who advocated for Britain to stay in the EU and instead made this city the Brexit capital of Britain with nearly 70percent of voters opting for outNow UKIP is hoping to convert those Brexit voters into supporters and in the process win just its third parliamentary seat since its founding nearly a quarter-century agoPolitics is changing said Paul Nuttall a mild-mannered academic who succeeded the bombastic Nigel Farage as UKIP leader and is campaigning to represent Stoke Its not just changing in this country Its changing all over the worldUnlike Farage who focused UKIP firepower in the more traditionally conservative country landscapes of southern England Nuttall has zeroed in on the struggling postindustrial centers of Englands north Traditionally Labour strongholds they have become vulnerable as the party has become more detached from its roots Nuttall said in an_interview at the partys purple-streaked offices in the citys centerThe Labour Party is more London-centric than its ever been They talk about the issues that may concern an Islington dinner party climate_change Palestine free_trade human_rights Nuttall said referring to the trendy north-London neighborhood that happens to be home to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn But those are not the issues on the doorstep in working-class areas Those issues are immigration cutting foreign-aid budgets law and order and putting British people firstThe echoes of Trump are no accident even if Nuttall insists that unlike Farage he didnt support the New_York billionaireUKIP is hoping to use at_least part of the Trump playbook and ride a populist wave to powerBut Labour has recognized the threat and is waging a determined battle to keep a seat it has held for nearly 70 years from falling into the hands of the far rightThis is a defining moment said Jack Dromey a Labour member of Parliament who is directing the partys campaign here Its the moment where either UKIP breaks through or we turn the tide against a grotesque populism purporting to be the party of the working classDromey a former union leader said voters in areas such as Stoke were right to feel discontent with a political establishment that hasnt always defended the interests of the working classTheres a distinct pride in Stoke Theres also a sense that Stoke is not the city it once was he said as party activists rushed in and out of party headquarters bearing stacks of red Labour leaflets I understand why people feel the way they doBut he depicted UKIP and Nuttall as opportunists seeking to capitalize on the working classs grievances for their own gainsUKIP is a party with no answers he said They simply seek to exploit discontentAnalysts say the outcome of Thursdays contest is impossible to predict with Labour UKIP and even the ruling Conservatives jousting over a seat that is normally so comfortably in Labours column that a vote count is hardly neededRob Ford a University of Manchester political_scientist who co-wrote a book on UKIP said that Stoke with its high concentration of white working-class and less-educated voters is exactly the sort of seat UKIP has long covetedOn paper its an area where UKIP should do well he saidBut paradoxically its success in pushing Britain toward Brexit and Prime_Minister Theresa Mays insistence on following through on UKIP demands for a clean break with Europe may have blunted the partys appeal By promising to deliver on UKIPs core demand May and her ruling Conservative Party have co-opted the anger that fed last years referendum vote at_least for the time beingThe large dissatisfied and distrustful element is still out there Its just that theyre unusually happy right_now Ford said They wont stay that way for too longIf UKIP comes up short in Stoke it would mark a significant setback to Nuttalls strategy of broadening UKIPs appeal by targeting working-class voters The UKIP leader who was Farages longtime deputy has already been damaged by claims he inflated his connections to the 1989 Hillsborough disaster when 96 soccer fans were crushed to death at a crowded stadiumBut in many ways Labour and its leader Corbyn have more on the line The party is suffering from historically bad polling figures that should they hold point to a Tory rout in the next general election in 2020On Thursday Labour faces the prospect of losing not only Stoke but also another traditionally safe Labour seat Copeland where the Tories are running hardCorbyn who shocked Britain by emerging from the far-left backbenches to become party leader in late 2015 has been unable to satisfy the partys pro-EU progressive wing or its Euroskeptical working-class base If his party loses both seats Thursday Labour could drift even further into the political wildernessCorbyn is not their only problem Ford said But hes made all their problems worseThose problems are easy enough to see on the streets of StokeTo Peter Doyle a cheerful pub and hotel owner Corbyn is a waste of space who hasnt used his role to defend Britain from the most dire impacts of Brexit Instead of Labour which sometimes gets his vote Doyle will be backing the ardently pro-EU Liberal DemocratsIm in business Doyle said Ive just come through one of the biggest recessions in British history I dont_want to go through another oneBut to Graham Patrick a longtime pottery worker who is now retired Labours opposition to Brexit marks it as out of touchLabour hasnt done much for us said Patrick who wore a faded blue Yankees cap with a purple UKIP rosette pinned to his chest as he walked through

former presidents George_W Bush and Bill ClintonLewis said on Meet the Press that he would not extend an invitation to TrumpThe Chinese_tourists were hesitant for a second perhaps startled by their North_Korean guides perfect use of Chinese curse words perhaps surprised by the sentimentF--- the Japanese devils F--- their mothers Mr Lee the guide shouted out to a busload of visitors making a day trip across the Yalu River into Sinuiju North KoreaRecovering from their initial surprise most of the middle-aged Chinese visitors joined in F--- the Japanese devils F--- their mothers they cheered back with whistles and clapping in an expletive-filled echoIt was a bonding moment between the neighborsThe excursion into North_Korea from this border town in northeastern China took a group of 51 Chinese_tourists by turns curious and nostalgic into the land of the Kims Their small green bus which carried them over the river and back in time was for Chinese visitors only The people on the bus did_not want to be fully identified because it could go badly for them but here is their accountIts like going back to elementary school said Lin a professor from Fujian And that was not criticismFirst stop a central square in Sinuiju with its new bronze statues of Kim_Il Sung and Kim_Jong Il the first two generations of the worlds only communist dynasty The tourists were told to get gaudy bunches of flowers at $3 a pop that was $150 for North_Korea to place at the feet of the two KimsThey had not even left the square before the flower vendors began clearing away the flowers and placing them back in their plastic baskets for the next wave of tourists They should at_least wait until we leave said Gu a middle-aged businesswoman from Shenzhen They need to work on their skillsRelations between Beijing and Pyongyang have become strained in recent_years as North_Korean leader_Kim Jong_Un has repeatedly defied and snubbed Xi_Jinping the Chinese president who is three decades his senior and many multiples his powerBut even as economic and political ties wobble tourism has become an important source of foreign revenue for North_Korea and it is more easily extracted from Chinese_tourists who tend to be obedient and sympathetic than say Americans who have proved less so Many Chinese come for what might be described as communostalgia a chance to reminisce about the good old days of iron-fisted central planningWith Sinuiju not having a lot of what would be called in any other country tourist attractions the next stop was a museum at which the guide talked crying about the time Kim_Il Sung visited The unfazed Chinese_tourists quietly waited for it to endLuckily they soon found themselves in the museum gift shop where cases displayed creams and lotions made in the local cosmetics factory another of Sinuijus attractionsThis stuff is so cheap And its natural and pure North_Korea isnt polluted like China Gu said She bought a dozen gift sets That was $550 more for North KoreaBack on the bus Mr Lee a slickly dressed 27-year-old started his anti-Japanese tirade simultaneously shocking and uniting his audience But he did allow that not all Japanese people are bad Then Mr Lee led the group into a restaurant designed for tourists After a lunch of fried fish kimchi glass noodles and pork with potato North_Korean women in bright traditional dress began singing old Red Army songs transporting the older Chinese_tourists back to their youths Gu and her friends had tears in their eyes These are songs we sang when we were growing up one saidPretty young North_Korean women took middle-aged Chinese men with beer bellies by the hand and dragged them onstage to sing together while the guides snapped photosThe North_Korean tour guides were perhaps better proponents of Chinese nationalism than the officials Xi has dispatched to try to whip up domestic fervorAfter another gift shop the final stop on the tour was a kindergarten where 5-year-olds welcomed the tourists in Korean and Chinese The most popular performance featured five boys dressed as North_Korean soldiers going through field exercises Then out came two dressed as Japanese soldiers with rats tails and then one as a senior American officer with a wolfs tail The Chinese_tourists lapped it upYoung kids in China these days are too spoiled too materialistic said Qi a man from Liaoning province We should have more nationalist education in our schools Look at North_Korea They know how to educate kidsAt the end of the performance one of the guides announced that the teachers would happily accept any gifts for the children Some tourists offered pencils cookies and sausages they had brought from ChinaOn the bus others felt bad they had nothing to give Not to worry Mr Lee had a planThe children had trained for a whole year for this performance he said They have eaten bitterness he said using a Chinese phrase for enduring hardshipPassengers began handing over Chinese notes worth $750 or $15When they arrived at the tourist center on the border it was time to hand over something else This time it was their cameras which had to be checked for photos deemed undesirable As the North_Koreans were censoring the photos the guides came out with flashy individualized folders featuring pictures of each tourist at the sites they had visited There were photos of them singing with North_Korean women at lunch pictures from the museum and snapshots of a chance encounter in a park with a couple on their wedding dayThe tourists were surprised at all of the trouble the North_Koreans had gone to and so quickly Many did_not have photos of themselves And it was good to help the poor starving North_Koreans wasnt it More than half of the tourists handed over $30 for their folder exorbitant at local pricesTheyre very smart Lin said While our photos were being deleted they were selling us pictures From the first step we took in this land they had planned out exactly how to get our money Congcong_Zhang in Sinuiju North_Korea contributed to this reportScott Pruitt the head of the Environmental Protection_Agency is poised to make wholesale changestothe agencys key advisory group by jettisoning scientists who have received grants from the EPA and replacing them with industry experts and state government officialsThe move represents a fundamental shift one that could change the scientific and technical advice that historically has guided the agency as it crafts environmental regulations The decision to bar any researcher who receives EPA grant money from serving as an adviser appears to be unprecedentedA list of expected appointees to the EPAs Science Advisory Board obtained by The Washington_Post from multiple individuals familiar_with the appointmentsinclude several categories of experts voices from regulated industries academics and environmental regulators from conservative states and researchers who have a history of critiquing the science and economics underpinning tighter environmental regulations They would replace a number of scientists who currently have agency grants and whose terms areexpiringThe formal list of appointees is scheduled to be announced TuesdayTerry F Yosie who was the advisory_boards director during the Reagan administration said the changes represent a major purge of independent scientists and a decision to sideline the SAB from major EPA decision-making in the futureThe EPA could not immediately be reached for comment but Pruitt suggested in a speech this month at the Heritage_Foundation that he planned to rid the agencys scientific advisory_boards of researchers with EPA funding He argued that the current structure raises questions about their independence though he did_not voice similar objections to industry-funded scientistsWhats most_important at the agency is to have scientific advisers that are objective independent-minded providing transparent recommendations Pruitt If we have individuals who are on those boards sometimes receiving money from the agency that to me causes questions on the independence and the veracity and the transparency of those recommendations that are coming our wayAmong the likely appointees are sharp proponents of deregulation who have argued both in academic circles and while_serving in government that federal regulators need to raise

international Paris climate agreement The report projected that meeting Americas commitment under the accord would mean as much as 27 million lost jobs by 2025That study was based on several assumptions including the idea that the United_States would meet its emissions targets not by maximizing energy efficiency or other low-cost approaches but by forcing the industrial sector to cut emissions by 40_percent between 2005 and 2025 The report did_not take into account potential benefits from cutting greenhouse gas emissions or technological advances that could make cutting carbon emissions cheaperAfter Trumps use of these statistics drew criticism NERA issued a statement saying that the 2016 reportstudy was not a cost-benefit analysis of the Paris agreement nor does it purport

assignment board members must go through a pretty elaborate conflict of interest process to make clear that they dont have a stake in the outcomeI just study how farmers make decisions she added Whether EPA regulates something or not that doesnt play into what I doAngela Nugent who previously worked for the EPA as the designated federal officer for the board said that the determination regarding EPA grants would differ from how the agency used to determine when a conflict of interest had occurredIt would be a major departure from current policy to assume that board members have a conflict of interest based on their grants without looking at the actual situation in which they are being asked to do their work and how those grants might affect it she saidIn the past Nugent said the board has required financial disclosures from members in relation to each particular study or project on which they were advisingDeterminations of conflict of interest were then made relating to the specifics of the subject matter conflicts rather_than a blanket bar because an individual had an EPA grantCurrent advisory members reached out to Pruitt on Sept 13 formally asking him to meet with them so they could discuss his agenda and their role in advising the agencySuch a meeting would afford you the opportunity to highlight EPA activities and priorities and would allow for a dialogue on

Araud He explained that shouldLe Pen make good on her vowsto remove France from the European_Union and the eurozone these departures would trigger a political earthquake inthe WestIt means the collapse of the EU because the EU without France doesnt make any sense he said And it means the collapse of the euro and a financial_crisis which will have consequences throughout the worldAraudspoke with Todays WorldView on Wednesday at the French embassy a vast and secluded compound on the leafy fringes of Georgetown Just a day earlier another French ambassador had seemingly broken diplomatic protocol to protest Le_Pen Thierry Dana Francesenvoy in Japan saying he would not serve in a government run by the far-rightIf the pieces of the French tragedy which are being put in place were to lead to her election I would stand aside from any diplomatic role Dana Araud on Twitter tweeted praise of Danas excellent articleTrs beau texte de mon homologue Tokyo Grard Araud (@GerardAraud) Le_Pen an ultra-nationalist who takes a hardline stance on immigration and Islam stands herbest chance yet to become president For now she isstill likely toBut in thewake of last years seismic political upheavals it would be foolish towrite her offAs Arauds tenure as Frances representative in the United Statesdraws to an end the 64-year-old can perhaps afford to be outspoken A career diplomat he has spent more_than a decade in the US in various posts including a stint as the French ambassador to the United_Nations He has watched with interest as his counterpartsin Washington come to grips with the new reality of life under PresidentTrumpThis city was in denial that something was happening said Araud gesturing to the capitals wonks and officialdom This city woke up on the ninth of November and its still under shockTill Nov 8 when I was asked whether our [own] far-right candidate would be elected my answer was no Suddenly I felt that I couldnt have the same answer Araud said He added that Trumps victory signaled that something major was happening in western democracies that Brexit was not an accident that we were facing a global crisis and that the world of our certainties was collapsing (Araud said as much on Twitterat the time provoking enough of a firestorm that he was )Like many other diplomats in Washington Araud says its too early to draw any real conclusions about the shape of US foreign_policy under Trump But officialsin European capitals have expressed general alarm over a vision of the global order that seems a radical rejection of longstanding American policiesMy advice to my authorities is to say try to forget the tweets and wait for the real policy said Araud He stressed that he has not had any hint from the new administration that Frances close relationship to the United_States willchangeI personally met Secretary [of Defense James] Mattis and his first sentence to me was that the French were the best allies of the US on the battlefield right_now said Araud a reference to French counterterrorism efforts in Syria Iraq and North AfricaMattis Vice_President Pence and Secretary of State_Rex Tillerson have all sought to reassure their European counterparts thatAmerican commitments wont change Next weeks visit to Washington by German Chancellor_Angela Merkelmay also generate more positive soundbitesI have spent twelve years of my_life in [the United States] but I have never felt the sort of paranoid frenzy that I see now on both_sides the sort of take-no-prisoners [approach to politics] and conspiracy theories he said What happened with the election comes on the top of a radicalization process that we are facing everywhere In Europe also our political life is much more radicalized than it was fifteen or twenty years agoWhileAraud is sanguine about the social tensions and economic inequities that have led us to this moment of crisis he also expressed bewildermentwith those in the United_States including who seem to be cheering the unraveling of the European_Union and the wider international liberal orderWhen you talk about the liberal order it isa Western order an American-led order said Araud before embarking on a bit of a history lesson The European_Union basically has two godfathers One is the president of the United_States and the other one is the pope In the 1950s Washington and the Catholic Church championed European integration as a bulwark against communismSo its a bit paradoxical to see the Americans joining the adversaries of what is an American order he said Thats a bit weirdPresident Trump pledged Friday that his administration remains committed to maintaining the United_States long-standing security alliance with Japan aiming to calm jitters in Tokyo over his inflammatory rhetoric on the campaign trailIn a news_conference with Prime_Minister Shinzo_Abe at the White_House Trump called the alliance the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Pacific region and he vowed to make ties_between the two countries even closerTrumps remarks on the alliance which hewed closely to statements of previous US presidents would not have been remarkable were it not for he aimed_at Japan during the 2016_presidential campaign He denounced a sizable US trade deficit to Japan and suggested Japan and South_Korea were not paying their share to support American troops based in the regionBut the summit aggressively pursued by the Japanese aimed to erase doubts even as the two sides remain at odds over how to move_forward on trade and economic tiesTrump sought to present the two countries in close harmony over shared challenges on North_Koreas nuclear_weapons programs and Chinas aggression in the South China_Sea both of which I consider a very very high priority he saidOn several occasions Trump gave Abe extended handshakes one in the Oval_Office lasted 19 seconds and patted him on the back displaying a personal warmth that has begun to develop between the two_men since Abe became the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his election victory in November Strong hands Trump remarked in the Oval_Office mimicking a golf swing The two were scheduled to play a round this weekend at Mar-a-Lago Trumps winter retreat in Palm_Beach FlaI grabbed him and hugged him because thats the way we feel Trump said at the news_conference describing his greeting of Abe outside the West_Wing We have a very very good bond very very good chemistryIll let you know if it changes Trump added drawing laughs in the East Room before adding But I dont_think it will Abe who has made a concerted effort to court Trump since his election praised the presidents outsider candidacy and uphill struggle and fight to win the White HouseThe Japanese leader also pledged that his country would play a greater role in defense and security operations although he was vague on what that might entail Japans Self-Defense Forces are prohibited from combat missions abroad under the constitution imposed on the country by the United_States after World_War IIOf course there are disagreements Abe said but we should not close down the dialogue just by pointing to the differences and ignoring the common interests and common goalsThe summit was being watched closely by US allies and partners across the globe for signs over how Trump would deal with a powerful ally after the unpredictable bluster of his campaign and early weeks of his presidency Trump has clashed with the leaders of Mexico and Australia and his move to cancel US participation in a 12-nation Pacific Rim trade pact that includes Japan raised alarms over how he would receive AbeAfter finishing formal talks Trump and Abe left the White_House together through the South Lawn entrance and boarded Marine One followed by Trumps daughter_Ivanka and her_husband Jared_Kushner a senior adviser to Trump Another Trump adviser Stephen_K Bannon also joined them on the presidential helicopter which whisked them past the Washington Monument on a flight path to Joint Base Andrews in Camp Springs Md where Air_Force One was waitingThere the two leaders were met by their wives first_lady Melania Trump and Akie Abe for the trip to Mar-a-Lago White_House officials said Trump plans to use the retreat for diplomatic bonding sessions in the way other presidents have used Camp DavidDuring the news_conference Trump was asked about his first phone conversation with Chinese President_Xi Jinping which had come Thursday evening The White_House said Trump reaffirmed his administration would honor Beijings One China policy that stipulates Taiwan is officially part of China despite the island having a separate governmentTrump angered Beijing by receiving a congratulatory phone_call from Taiwans president after his election and publicly questioning the One China policy suggesting his administration might renounce it unless China offered better trade deals to the United StatesOn Friday Trump characterized the call with Xi as very very warmI think we are on the process of getting along very well he saidFor his part Abe largely avoided talking in specifics about Trumps decision to break with his predecessor and withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership a 12-nation Pacific Rim free-trade deal that Trump opposed during the campaignBut he did promise that Japan would support Trumps economic_growth strategyThere will be even more new jobs born in the US Abe saidTrump promised that the United_States would be an even bigger player than it is right_now by a lot when it comes to tradeIn a joint statement the two nations said Trump accepted Abes invitation to visit Japan later this yearAnd in another gesture of goodwill Abe made sure to praise Trumps golf gameMy scores in golf are not up to the level of Donald at all Abe said in Japanese according to a translatorIt was not clear however whether Trump understood him the president failed to attach the earpiece of his translation device until after Abes opening statementInvestigators are focusing on a series of meetings held by Jared_Kushner President Trumps_son-in-law and an influential White_House adviser as part of their probe into Russian_meddling in the 2016 election and related matters according to people_familiar with the investigationKushner who held meetings in December with the Russian_ambassador and a banker from Moscow is being investigated because of the extent and nature of his interactions with the Russians the people saidThe Washington_Post reported last_week that a senior White_House official close to the president was a significant focus of the high-stakes investigation though it did_not name KushnerFBI agents also remain keenly interested in former Trump national_security adviser_Michael Flynn and former Trump campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort but Kushner is the only current White_House official known to be considered a key person in the probeThe Post has not been told that Kushner is a target or the central focus of the investigation and he has not been accused of any wrongdoing Target is a word that generally refers to someone who is the main suspect of investigators attention though prosecutors can and do bring charges_against people who are not marked with that distinctionMr Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry said Jamie Gorelick one of his attorneysIn addition to possible_coordination between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign to influence the 2016_presidential election investigators are also looking broadly into possible financial crimes but the people_familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak_publicly did_not specify who or what was being examined Sarah_Isgur Flores a Justice_Department spokeswoman said I cant confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of investigations or subjects of investigations The FBI declined to comment At the time of the December meetings Trump already had won the election Contacts between people on the transition_team and foreign_governments can be routine but the meetings and phone_calls with the Russians were not made public at the timeIn early December Kushner met in New_York with the Russian_ambassador to the United_States Sergey_Kislyak and he later sent a deputy to meet with Kislyak Flynn was also present at the early-December meeting and later that month Flynn held a call with Kislyak to discuss US-imposed sanctions against Russia Flynn initially mischaracterized the conversation even to Vice_President Pence ultimately prompting his ouster from the White HouseKushner also met in December with Sergey Gorkov the head of Vnesheconombank which has been the subject of US sanctions following Russias annexation of Crimea and its support of separatists in eastern UkraineIn addition to the December meetings a former senior intelligence official said FBI_agents had been looking closely at earlier exchanges between Trump associates and the Russians dating to the spring of 2016 including one at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington Kushner and Kislyak along with close Trump adviser and current attorney_general Jeff_Sessions were present at an where then-candidate Trump promised in a speech to seek better relations with Russia It is unclear_whether Kushner and Kislyak interacted thereThe that Kushner omitted from security-clearance forms his December meetings with Kislyak and Gorkov though his attorney said that was a mere error and he told the FBI soon after that he would amend the forms The White_House said that his meetings were and inconsequentialKushner has with the Senate_Intelligence Committee which is conducting one of several investigations into Russian_meddling in the 2016 electionIn many ways Kushner is a unique figure inside the White HouseHe is arguably the presidents most trusted adviser and he is also a close member of the presidents family His list of policy responsibilities is vast his foreign_policy portfolio alone includes Canada and Mexico China and peace in the Middle_East yet he rarely speaks publicly about any of themFormer FBI_director Robert_S Mueller_III is now leading the probe into possible_coordination between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign and he has set_up shop in the Patrick Henry Building in downtown DC Even before he was picked by Deputy_Attorney General_Rod J_Rosenstein to take over the case investigators had been stepping up their efforts issuing subpoenas and looking to conduct interviews people_familiar with the matter saidA small_group of lawmakers known as the Gang of Eight was recently notified of the change in tempo and focus in the investigation at a classified briefingIt is unclear exactly how Muellers leadership will affect the direction of the probe This week Justice_Department ethics_experts even_though lawyers at his former firm WilmerHale represent several people who could be caught up in the matter including Kushner Manafort and Trumps daughter_Ivanka who is married to KushnerMueller resigned from the firm to take over the investigationInvestigators are continuing to look aggressively into the dealings of Flynn and a grand_jury in Alexandria_Va recently issued a subpoenas for records related to Flynns businesses and finances according to people_familiar with the matterFlynns company the Flynn Intel Group was paid more_than $500000 by a company owned by a Turkish American businessman close to top Turkish officials

Robert_E Lee was an honorable man Kelly told Ingraham He was a man that gave up his country to fight for his state which 150 years_ago was more important than country It was always loyalty to state

is today accepted as right and wrong and go back 100 200 300 years or more and say what those you know what Christopher Columbus did was wrong he said You_know 500 years later its inconceivable to me that you would take what we think now and apply it back then The comments quickly touched off a cascade of strong reactionsamong progressives on social_media author Ta-Nehisi Coates pointed out that

reemerged as a particularly potent and emotional fight exploding into full view in August after a weekend of white nationalist rallies in Charlottesville protesting the planned removal of a Robert_E

begun debating how to addressthe Confederate statues that dot the South with many choosing to remove the monuments But the issue has taken an increasingly political turn since Charlottesville emerging asan in the gubernatorial race in VirginiaSome polls have shown that the public is divided about the statues and what they represent About 54 percent of Americans viewed the statues as symbols of Southern pride and not white_supremacy to a poll from the Economist and YouGov in the summerWhile some contend that the Civil_War was fought over states_rights scholars that slavery was the primary driver of theconflictWhite House_Chief of Staff_John F_Kelly said Monday he would not apologize for the false attacks he leveled against Rep Frederica S Wilson (D-Fla) this month when he sought to defend President Trump for his handling of a condolence call to the widow of a fallen soldierOn Oct 19 ina rare appearance at the White Housemedia briefing Kelly attacked Wilson as an empty barrel and accused her ofgrandstanding at a public event two years_ago in Florida by takingcredit for securing federal funding for a new buildingVideo of the event soon released by the Florida Sun Sentinel showed Wilson did no such thing Rather she used her speech to praise the two slainFBI agents in whose memorythe building was namedWilson accused Kelly of character assassination and members of the Congressional Black Caucus demanded that Kelly apologizeIn an_interview to be broadcast Monday_night Fox_News Channel host Laura Ingraham asked Kelly whether hehad something to apologize forOh no Kelly replied No Never Well Ill apologize if I need to But for something like that absolutely not I stand by my comments Kelly suggested that he may have been accusing Wilson of grandstanding in a private discussion as opposed to in her public speech although his comment to Ingraham was vagueIll go back and talk about before her comments and at the reception afterwards Kelly said Again it was a package deal Dont want to get into itKelly went on to say that Myeshia Johnson the widow of fallen Sgt La_David Johnson has actedwithin her rights to speak out publicly about Trumps handling of his condolence callAs far as the young widow goes she has every right to say what she wants to say Kelly told Ingraham But its the politicization of something that was so from the heartIngrahams interview one of Kellys rare public appearances delved into a range of other topics including the removal of Confederate and other historical monuments an issue that has animated Trump in recent monthsIngraham asked Kelly about a historic church in Alexandria_Va where former president George Washington worshiped deciding to remove plaques memorializing both Washington and Confederate general Robert_E Lee because they were considered intolerant Well historys history Kelly said And there are certain things in history that were not so good and other things that were very very good I_think we make a

Jon Stewart just cant stay off television On Tuesday the former Daily Show host once_again joined his old friend Stephen Colbert on The Late_Show This time Stewart wanted to share his thoughts on the first 11_days of President Trump in the White HouseOf course he did so while wearing a very long tie and an animal skin cap Is this your Donald Trump impression Colbert inquired I thought this is how men dress now said Stewart who that he lives in Colberts studio since The Daily Show is off the air The president sets mens fashion super long tie dead animal on headStewart said he stopped by to deliver some news Hehad special exclusive access to even of Suddenly part of Stewarts animal hat fell in his face and he and Colbert could barely hold it together The audience also couldnt stop laughingPeople this nation is in crisis Stewart admonished This is seriousOnce the crowd settled down Stewart read his version of Trumps next executive orderBy the authority vested in me by the Constitution I Donald_J Jonah Jameson Trump hereby direct that to secure our border China shall immediately and without hesitation send us their wall Stewart said slipping into a Trump accent Done

mostly lookeddirectly into the cameraI Donald_J Trump dodeclare by executive_order that I Donald_J Trump am exhausting It has been 11_days Stephen Eleven fing days Eleven The presidency is supposed to

just your respect but your adoration Parades with the tanks and the synchronized dancing And why cant they train 10000 doves to spell out Trumpin the clouds How hard can it be theyre already flyingI Donald_J Trump am exhausting because it is going to take relentless stamina vigilance and every institutional check and balance this great country can muster to keep me Donald_J Trump from going full with the lightning coming out of the fingertips and the We have never faced this before purposeful vindictive chaos But perhaps therein lies the saving grace of my Donald_J Trumps presidency No one action will be adequate All actions will be necessary And if we do not allow Donald Trump to exhaust our fight and somehow come through this presidency calamity-less and constitutionally partially intact then I Donald_J Trump will have demonstrated the greatness of America just not the way I thought I was gonnaThe acting_attorney general informed the Trump White_House late last_month that she believed Michael_Flynn had misled senior administration officials about the nature of his communications with the Russian_ambassador to the United_States and warned that the national_security adviser was potentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail current and former US officials saidThe message delivered by and a senior career national_security official to the White_House counsel was prompted by concerns that Flynn when asked about his calls and texts with the Russiandiplomat had told Vice President-elect Mike_Pence and others that he had not discussed the on Russia for its interference in the 2016 election the officials said It is unclear what the White_House counsel Donald McGahn did with the information night in the wake of revelations about his contacts with the Russian_ambassador In the waning days of the Obama_administration James_R Clapper_Jr who was the director of national intelligence and John Brennan the CIA_director at the time shared Yatess concerns and concurred with her recommendation to inform the Trump White_House They feared that Flynn had put himself in a compromising position and thought that Pence had a right to know that he had been misled according to one of the officials who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence mattersA senior Trump administration official said before Flynns resignation that the White_House was aware of the matter adding that weve been working on this for weeksThe current and former officials said that although they believed that Pence was misled about the contents of Flynns communications with the Russian_ambassador they couldnt rule out that Flynn was acting with the knowledge of others in the transitionThe FBI Yates Clapper and Brennan declined to comment on the matter In a Feb8 interview with The Washington_Post Flynn categorically denied discussing sanctions with Russian_Ambassador Sergey_Kislyak repeating public assertions made in January by top Trump officials One day after the interview Flynn revised his account telling The_Post through a spokesman that he couldnt be certain that the topic never came upTwo officials said a main topic of the relevant call was the sanctions Officials also said there was no_evidence that Russia had attempted to exploit the discrepancy between public statements by Trump officials and what Flynn had discussed Flynn told The_Post earlier_this month that he first met Kislyak in 2013 when Flynn was director of the Defense Intelligence_Agency and made a trip to MoscowUS intelligence reports during the 2016_presidential campaign showed that Kislyak was in touch with Flynn officials said Communications between the two continued after Trumps victory on Nov8 according to officials with access to intelligence reports on the matterKislyak in a brief interview with The_Post confirmed having contacts with Flynn before and after the election but he declined to say what was discussedFor Yates and other officials concerns about the communications peaked in the days after the Obama_administration on Dec29 announced measures to punish Russia for what it said was the Kremlins interference in the election in an attempt to helpTrumpAfter the sanctions were rolled out the Obama_administration braced itself for the Russian retaliation To the surprise of many US officials Russian President_Vladimir Putin announced on Dec30 that there would be no response Trump praised the decision on TwitterIntelligence analysts began to search for clues that could help explain Putins move The search turned up Kislyaks communications which the FBI routinely monitors and the phone_call in question with Flynn From that call and subsequent intercepts FBI_agents wrote a secret report summarizing Flynns discussions with KislyakYates then the deputy attorney_general considered Flynns comments in the intercepted call to be highly significant and potentially illegal according to an official familiar_with herthinkingYates and other intelligence officials suspected that Flynn could be in violation of an obscure US statute known as the Logan Act which bars US citizens from interfering in diplomatic disputes with another countryAt the same_time Yates and other law_enforcement officials knew there was little chance of bringing against Flynn a case related to the Logan Act a statute that has never been used in a prosecution In_addition to the legal and political hurdles Yates and other officials were aware of an FBI investigation looking at possible contacts_between Trump associates and Russia which now included the Flynn-Kislyak communicationsWord of the calls leaked out on Jan12 in What did Flynn say and did it undercut US sanctions Ignatius wrote citing the Logan ActThe next_day a Trump transition official told The_Post I can tell_you that during his call sanctions were not discussed whatsoeverWhite House_press secretary_Sean Spicer in a conference call with reporters on Jan13 said that the conversation between Flynn and Kislyak had centeredon the logistics of a post-inauguration call between Trump and Putin That was it plain and simple Spicer addedOn Jan15 Pence was asked about the phone_call during Citing a conversation he had with Flynn Pence said the incoming national_security adviser and Kislyak did_not discuss anything having to do with the United_States decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against RussiaBefore the Pence statement on Jan15 top Justice_Department and intelligence officials had discussed whether the incoming Trump White_House should be notified about the contents of the Flynn-Kislyak communicationsPences statement on CBS made the issue more urgent current and former officials said because US intelligence_agencies had reason to believe that Russia was aware that Flynn and Kislyak had discussed sanctions in their December call contrary to public statementsThe internal debate over how to handle the intelligence on Flynn and Kislyak came to a head on Jan19 Obamas last full day in officeYates Clapper and Brennan argued for briefing the incoming administration so the new president could decide how to deal with the matter The officials discussed options including telling Pence the incoming White_House counsel the incoming chief of staff or Trump himselfFBI Director_James B_Comey initially opposed notification citing concerns that it could complicate the agencys investigationClapper and Brennan left their positions when Trump was sworn in but Yates stayed on as acting_attorney general until Jan30 when for refusing to defend his executive_order temporarily barring refugees and people from seven majority-Muslim countries an action that had been challenged in courtA turning point came after Jan23 when Spicer in his first official media briefing again was asked about Flynns communications with Kislyak Spicer said that he had talked to Flynn about the issue again last night There was just one call Spicer said And it covered four subjects a plane crash that claimed the lives of a Russian military choir Christmas greetings Russian-led talks over the Syrian civil_war and the logistics of setting_up a call between Putin and Trump Spicer said that was the extent of the conversationYates again raised the issue with Comey who now backed away from his opposition to informing the White_House Yates and the senior career national_security official spoke to McGahn the White_House counsel who didnt respond Monday to a request for comment his national_security adviser after the news brokeOn Monday afternoon Kellyanne_Conway counselor to the president said Trump had full confidence in Flynn Minutes later however Spicer delivered a contradictory statement to reportersThe president is evaluating the situation Spicers statement read Hes speaking to Vice_President Pence relative to the conversation the vice_president had with Gen Flynn and also speaking to various other people about what he considers the single most_important subject there is Our national securityAnd then late Monday Flynn resigned Karen DeYoung and Greg Miller contributed to this reportAlternative facts are not facts They are falsehoods Chuck Todd tells Pres Trumps counselor Kellyanne_Conway this morning WATCH Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) If there is one video clip that describes the new reality for the political media and for the truth during the President Trump era it is the one aboveIts a discussion about White_House press_secretary Sean_Spicer on his first full day in that job having taken to the podium and about the size of Trumps inauguration crowdWhy put him out there for the very first time in front of that podium to utter a provable falsehood Chuck Todd Its a small thing but the first time he confronts the public its a falsehoodAfter some tense back and forth Conway offered thisDont be so overly dramatic about it Chuck Youre saying its a falsehood and theyre giving our press_secretary Sean_Spicer gave alternative facts to that But the point really is At this point a visibly exasperated Todd cut in Wait a minute Alternative facts Alternative facts Four of the five facts he uttered were just not true Alternative facts are not facts theyre falsehoodsFake news is so yesterday Alternative facts is where its at nowThis of course isnt the first time the Trump team and its supporters have responded to journalists calling out their falsehoods by claiming the truth isnt so black and white or that its not a big dealFormer Trump campaign_manager Corey_Lewandowski comparing Trump with a guy at the bar and saying Youre going to say things and sometimes you dont have all the facts to back it upThat same week pro-Trump CNN pundit Scottie Nell Hughes One thing thats been interesting this campaign season to watch is that people that say facts are facts theyre not really facts Everybody has a way its kind of like looking at ratings or looking at a glass of half-full water Everybody has a way of interpreting them to be the truth or not trueTheres no such thing unfortunately anymore of factsHughes is not an official spokesman for the Trump team but that last comment is basically what Conway is arguing today that there are so many shades of gray that clear facts just dont really existThis of course is a hugely cynical worldview But its about the only way the Trump team can fight back given how questionable Whether you like Trump or not its demonstrably true that he says things that are easily proved false over and over again The question the media has regularly confronted is not whether Trumps facts are correct but whether to say hes deliberately lying or notA memo is circulating on social_media right_now that claims to be from someone who worked in a past White_House and tries to explain what the Trump team is doingRe Spicers lies this is from someone who worked in a past administration Important read Anna Rascout-Paz (@rascouet) Its not clear where this memo came from but no matter the provenance it makes some good points Trump himself has been using his own brand of the truth which is often false for months And there was really no way that his administration wasnt going to have to deal with that same tendency during his presidencyOn Saturday in Spicers statement and now Sunday in Conways interview the two are attempting to set a precedent that says they dont recognize the concept of facts as the media has come to define them they have their own alternative facts and theyll rely on thoseAnd as brazen as it is its likely to appeal to that one-third of Americans the memo describes as being Trumps base Polls have regularly shown a large portion of Republicans are more apt to believe Trumps claims even if they are pretty patently false Its a symptom of media distrustThe New_York Timess Glenn Thrush tweeted this Saturday after Spicers statementPrediction There will be a poll out next week that will show 70-80% of Trump supporters believing that Mall photos were fake_news Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) Both fake_news and the concept of alternative facts are now cudgels in the effort to obfuscate when reporters point out that Trump and his team have their facts wrong Welcome to our new political reality or rather realitiesKellyanne Conway thinks she took too_much flak for to justify President Trumps travel_ban She said she simply and she later said Except now she doesnt appear to have misspoken at all she seems to have believed that the Bowling_Green massacre was a real thingHow do we know Because she cited the same nonexistent attack in separate interviews with two other outlets Cosmopolitan magazine and TMZWhile discussing why former president_Barack Obama halted refugees from Iraq in 2011 He did that because two Iraqi nationals came to this country joined ISIS traveled back to the Middle_East to get trained and refine their terrorism skills and come back here and were the masterminds behind the Bowling_Green massacre of taking innocent soldiers lives awayAnd she echoed those comments when that same_day as Monday afternoonHe did that because I assume there were two Iraqis who came here got radicalized joined ISIS and then were the masterminds behind the Bowling_Green attack on our brave soldiers she saidConways version of events here is a mess The the two_men admitted using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) against US soldiers in Iraq and attempted to send weapons and money to al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) for the purpose of killing US soldiers The FBI say the two_men traveled back to the Middle_East to train for an attack And there was no attack on US soilConways initial quote last_week about Bowling_Green with MSNBCs Chris Matthews was that the Iraqis were the masterminds behind the Bowling_Green massacreAnd that she meant the men were the masterminds of the plot which was to send weapons to al-Qaeda in IraqBut masterminds is also a word that generally connotes a complex terrorist act And now we have these new quotesshowing Conway believed this Bowling_Green massacre involved overseas training and taking innocent soldiers lives away in Bowling_Green KyTrump supporters will dismiss this as quibbling given that the men did target US soldiers in Iraq But Trumps travel_ban is aimed_at preventing terrorism of which Bowling_Green isnt an example Yet Conway cited it three_times as justification and seemed to believe a massacre occurred thereAnd it all goes back to a point I made last_week about what this says about the White_Houses messaging operation A week after Trumps travel_ban was instituted Conway still Perhaps it could be excused as a slip of the tongue But in context its just more evidence of a White_House messaging operation that doesnt have its shoes on the right feet Time and again in the last two_weeks Trumps top messengers have gotten their facts wrong mixed their messages and struggled to defend their boss There simply doesnt_seem to be any planAdd this one to the list was offered to SOTU on Sunday by the White_House We passed Those are the facts CNN Communications (@CNNPR)For a few hours after a bombshell in which actor Anthony Rapp

Intl Emmy Awards (@iemmys)Kim Jong_Il the North_Korean leader who threatened the world with his nuclear_weapons ambitions and suppressed his own people with imprisonment and isolation left in the wake of his death Saturday an antiquated country with a power vacuum raises immediate questions about the future and the stability of perhaps the worlds most isolated state which for six decades has been held together by the Kim family personality cult Kim was deified by state media described as the Dear Leader A weeping television anchor Monday told North_Korea of Kims deathSecurity analysts and officials from Seoul to Washington have long believed that Kims death would double as a pivot point on the Korean_Peninsula But that poses a threat of its own as North_Korea tries to pass power to Kims youngest son who is in his 20sIn an announcement Monday North_Korea called Kim_Jong Eun a great successor and urged its people to follow his leadership The state also test-fired two short-range missiles off its east coast according to South_Koreas Yonhap_News Agency Yonhap quoted an official in Seoul as saying the test most_likely was part of a routine drill and was not related to Kim_Jong Ils death Until late last_year the younger Kim had lived his life almost entirely behind a wall of privacy But as his father struggled with his health he accelerated a controversial and in late September 2010 named Kim_Jong Eun to several top military and political posts This year when the elder Kim made his customary visits to military camps and factories across the country his son often accompanied him not as an equal but as a traineeOne concern described by numerous Korean security experts is that the younger Kim could face opposition from more senior North_Korean officials including Jang Song Thaek who had been acting as a caretaker for the transition In recent_years Kim_Jong Il tried to minimize the power of other older party members often demoting them sometimes even banishing them to the countryside so they wouldnt form allies of their ownSince taking over from his father Kim_Il Sung in 1994 Kim kept a tight hold on North_Korean society using the juche ideology emphasizing national self-reliance to rationalize strict crackdowns on political opposition Those who spoke out against the Kim family were sent to prison camps defectors say along with their parents and childrenThe countrys leadership maintained a ban on most communication Most North_Koreans even now have no access to the Internet Several hundred thousand North_Koreans now have cellphones but they can make only domestic callsAs a result North_Korea dealt with almost no dissent a stark contrast to Arab countries that this year revolted against authoritarian rulers For almost two_decades now North_Korea has defied predictions of its demise Kims death sparked new concerns that the country could become less stableIn Tokyo Japanese leaders held an emergency security meeting South_Koreas Joint_Chiefs of Staff put its front-line military on emergency alert with heightened concern about a provocation along the contested maritime border dipped more_than 45 percent amid the news of Kims deathIn recent_years particularly since his apparent August 2008 stroke US intelligence_agencies had monitored Kims health closely But it was not clear whether they knew his death was imminent Kim took several trips this year to and Russia traveling by heavily armored trainAnalysts at the CIA and other agencies have warned that his demise could destabilize the country and make it more dangerousThis brings extraordinary change and uncertainty to a country that has seen little change in decades said one US official who spoke on the condition of anonymity South_Koreas concern is warranted frankly because an insecure North_Korea could well be an even more dangerous North KoreaFor almost two_decades South_Korea and the United_States have discussed contingencies in the event of Kims death and North_Koreas collapse If the Korean_Peninsula were to be unified millions of impoverished North_Koreans could flood the border into the South The cost of unification according to one major study could exceed $1 trillion and last_year President Lee Myung-bak proposed a unification tax not yet put into place to prepare for such a momentThe White_House issued a statement late Sunday acknowledging Kims death The president has been notified and we are in close touch with our allies in South_Korea and Japan We remain committed to stability on the Korean peninsula and to the freedom and security of our alliesSecretary of State Hillary_Rodham Clinton was briefed on the reports of Kims death a department spokesman saidClinton has increased the pressure on the North_Korean government in recent_weeks traveling to Burma last_month in a bid to drive a wedge between Pyongyang and one of its few customers for nuclear technology After the trip there was speculation that she might follow her Burma visit with a trip to the North_Korean capital Clinton also appointed a new US envoy last fall to make a new push for a diplomatic breakthrough on North_Koreas nuclear_program Especially in the past two years North_Korea has depended for much of its security on China which supplies Pyongyang with much-needed aid and investment China has also used its influence to block UN measures against North_Korea and US officials have called on China to use its influence to encourage North_Koreas liberalizationAlmost nothing is known about how Kim_Jong Eun if he successfully takes power will run the countryBefore his death Kim_Jong Il had been grooming his third and youngest son as his successor Kim_Jong Eun studied for a time in Switzerland at a German-speaking high_school in Liebefeld a suburb of the Swiss capital Bern Former classmates remember a shy but determined boy obsessed with American basketball and expensive sports shoes They say he spoke passable German and made some local friends but was monitored closely by staff members s from the North_Korean Embassy in BernHe vanished in the middle of the school year in 2000 apparently to return to Pyongyang and had not been seen in public since until he emerged at his fathers heir apparent last_year A campaign of hagiographic propaganda hailed him as the Dear Young General but it is unclear how_much support he has

major change is needed to kick-start South_Koreas anemic economy South Koreans have long bristled at the power of the conglomerates known here as chaebol but have been afraid that change would inflict huge economic pain on the countryThat thinking has shifted during the scandal embroiling the president which centers on allegations that the chaebol particularly Samsung paid bribes to win favorable treatment from the government thereby becoming even more powerfulThis shift means that the main point of difference_between presidential candidates is foreign_policy and national securityEveryone agrees we need to do something about the chaebol said Shim Jae-hoon a veteran political commentator Its North_Korea that will be the deciding factor and that will clinch the presidency in the next election As did former president Roh rival candidate Moon comes from the progressive camp that favors engagement with Pyongyang as a way to minimize tensions and the economic gap_between the two

nuclear belligerence and to keep some leverage_over Pyongyang he saidThat stance doesnt however mean hes opposed to talkingI think there should be inter-Korean dialogue but I believe that we need to

Im_going to win Yoonjung_Seo contributed to this reportSpecial counsel_Robert S_Mueller III on Monday revealed charges_against three former Trump campaign officials including onetime campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort marking the first criminal allegations to come from probes into possible Russian influence in US political affairsThe charges are striking for their breadth touching all levels of the Trump campaign and exploring possible personal financial wrongdoing by those involved as well as what appeared to be a concerted effort by one campaign official to arrange a meeting with Russian officials One of the three charged former Trump admitted to making a false statement to FBI investigators who asked about his contacts with foreigners claiming to have high-level Russian connections Manafort and longtime business_partner Rick_Gates meanwhile were charged in a 12-count_indictment with conspiracy to launder money making false_statements and other charges in connection with their work advising a Russia-friendly political party in Ukraine The investigation which the FBI began last_year but escalated significantly with Muellers appointment in May has taken a heavy toll on the Trump administration repeatedly putting the president on the defensive as reports have emerged about the work the special_counsels team is doing With Mondays revelations a week that otherwise might have been spent with Washington focused on the Republican tax plan will have talking heads dissecting the criminal counts against former Trump campaign officials and speculating about the next shoe to drop Papadopouloss plea_agreement signed earlier_this month and unsealed_Monday described his extensive efforts to try to broker connections with Russian officials and arrange a meeting between them and the Trump campaign Emails show that his offers were sometimes looked at warily though more-senior campaign officials at_least entertained themManafort and Gates pleaded not guilty in a brief appearance in DC federal court Monday afternoon A federal magistrate judge put the men on home confinement and set a $10 million unsecured bond for Manafort and a $5million unsecured bond for Gates That means the men would be in debt to the government if they failed to show up for court though they do not have to put any money down Both surrendered their passports to the FBI The next hearing in the case was scheduled for Nov 2 before US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson a 2011 President_Barack Obama appointee who previously worked as a federal_prosecutor in the DistrictFor their part Trump his spokeswoman and his lawyer sought to cast the charges as having nothing to do with the president White_House press_secretary Sarah_Huckabee Sanders asserted that Papadopoulos had an extremely limited volunteer role in the campaign and said that no activity was ever done in an official capacity on behalf of the campaign in that regard Ty Cobb a White_House lawyer overseeing the administrations handling of the Mueller probe said The one thing thats clear is theres no reference to collusion no reference to the presidentThe president himself to declare Sorry but this is years_ago before Paul_Manafort was part of the Trump campaign But why arent Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus Also there is NO COLLUSION he said in a follow-up Sanders said that Trump had no intention or plan to make any changes with regard to the special_counsel and Cobb said there had been no talk of possible pardons for Manafort or Gates No no no Thats never come up and wont come up Cobb said in an interviewOutside the DC courthouse Kevin Downing a lawyer for Manafort said President Donald Trump was correct There is no_evidence that Mr Manafort and the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian_government Glenn Selig a Gates spokesman said that Gates welcomes the opportunity to confront these charges in courtThis fight is just beginning Selig said The charges are a major step in the investigation but they do not represent a conclusion Court documents revealed that Papadopoulos for example has been cooperating with investigators for three months having been arrested and charged in July after landing at Dulles International Airport on a flight from Germany The information he provides could be key to furthering Muellers investigation_into others legal_analysts said Papadopoulos admitted that he had lied to the FBI about his interactions with people he thought had connections with the Russian_government essentially understating the conversations and claiming falsely that they had occurred before he joined Trumps campaign In a January 2017 interview with the FBI Papadopoulos told agents that a London-based professor claimed to him that he had dirt on Hillary_Clinton including thousands of emails But Papadopoulos said that initially he viewed the professor as a nothing In reality according to his plea Papadopoulos understood that the professor had connections to Russian_government officials and he treated him seriously An email quoted in court_filings appears to match one in which Papadopoulos identified the professor with whom he met as Joseph Mifsud the director of the London Academy of Diplomacy After a March_2016 meeting with the professor who was not identified in court_records Papadopoulos_emailed a campaign supervisor and other members of the campaigns foreign_policy team He claimed that the professor had introduced him to Putins_niece and the Russian_ambassador in London and that the purpose was to arrange a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss US-Russia ties under President Trump court_documents say The government noted that the woman was not Russian President_Vladimir Putins_niece and while Papadopoulos expected the professor to introduce him to the Russian_ambassador that never happened But in the months that followed Papadopoulos continued to correspond with the woman and the professor about a meeting between the Trump campaign possibly including Trump himself and Russian officialsThe Russian_government has an open invitation by Putin for Mr Trump to meet him when he is ready Papadopoulos wrote to a senior policy_adviser for the campaign on April 25At one point a campaign official forwarded one of Papadopouloss emails to another campaign official saying We_need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips It should be someone low_level in the campaign so as not to send any signal DT would appear to be a reference to Donald Trump Papadopouloss effort continued into the summer of 2016 and in August 2016 a campaign supervisor told Papadopoulos and another foreign_policy adviser that they should meet with Russian officials That ultimately did_not take_place according to the pleaAccording to documents and interviews the supervisor was national campaign co-chairman Sam_Clovis whose lawyer said he actually opposed the trip and was just being polite Other officials who received emails from Papadopoulos were campaign_manager Corey_Lewandowski and ManafortLawyers for Papadopoulos said in a statement We will have the opportunity to comment on Georges involvement when called upon by the Court at a later date We look_forward to telling all of the details of Georges story at that timeIn a separate indictment the special_counsel alleged that Manafort and Gates laundered money for nearly a decade through scores of US and foreign corporations and accounts and gave false_statements to the Justice_Department and others when asked about their work on behalf of a foreign entity The time period stretched into at_least 2016 though it did_not seem to involve the Trump campaign According to the indictment Manafort and Gates arranged to hire two Washington-based lobbying_firms to work on behalf of their Ukrainian clients arranging meetings with US officials and boosting their public image in the United_States Though it was not named one of the firms referenced in the indictment is the Podesta_Group Tony_Podesta the head of the firm The other firm is Mercury Public_Affairs according to people_familiar with the matter A partner at Mercury said the firm believed our work was intended to serve an important and proper purposeProsecutors say Manafort and Gates arranged for a Brussels-based nonprofit to nominally hire the Washington companies to hide the fact that the two_men were working for Ukrainian government officials otherwise they would have been required to register under the Foreign_Agents Registration ActIn fact prosecutors allege Manafort was communicating directly with then-Ukrainian President Viktor_Yanukovych about the effort promising in 2012 to provide him weekly updates Prosecutors say that when the Justice_Department approached Manafort and Gates in 2016 and 2017 about whether they should have registered as foreign agents for the work they responded with false and misleading letters according to the indictmentManafort and Gates also were accused of trying to hide money kept in foreign_bank accounts Manafort from 2011 to 2014 and Gates from 2012 to 2014 And Manafort was accused of filing fraudulent tax_returns stating on tax forms he filed from 2008 to 2014 that he controlled no foreign_bank accountsAll told more_than $75 million flowed through offshore_accounts the special_counsel alleged From 2008 to 2014 according to the indictment Manafort arranged to wire $12 million from offshore_accounts to pay for personal expenses including $5 million to a home renovation contractor in the Hamptons more_than $13 million to a home entertainment and lighting vendor based in Florida $934000 to an antique-rug dealer in Alexandria and $849000 to a mens clothier in New YorkLaw

according to interviews with current and former senior officials in the inspector generals office congressional_investigators and a review of internal email and other documentsSchmitz also drew scrutiny for his unusual fascination with Baron Friedrich Von Steuben a Revolutionary War hero who is considered the militarys first true inspector general Schmitz even replaced the official inspector

defense contractor Blackwater In in The Washington_Post covering the move DanielleBrian executive director of the Project on Government Oversight said The inspector general is a standard-bearer for ethics and integrity for the Pentagon To see a person who has been holding that position cash in on his public service and go work for one of their contractors is tremendously disappointing In a brief phone_call Monday Schmitz confirmed that he is working for theTrump campaign and said that he has been involved for the past month He said he frequently confers with Sam_Clovis one of Trumps top policy advisers and that there has been a series of conference calls and briefings in recent weeksAccording to his LinkedIn profile Schmitz attended the US Naval Academy and Stanford Law School and

people in energy policy circles in London Washington and New_York said they knew nothing of himAlmostall his workappears to have revolved around the role of Greece Cyprus and an Israeli natural_gas discovery in the eastern Mediterranean YetJonathan Sterndirector of gas research at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said when asked about PapadopoulosHe does ring a very faint bell but hes not written anything very significant on East Mediterranean natural_gas and pipelines that I can rememberIndeed Papadopoulos has not left much of a paper trail He has written an oped piece in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz and three articles for Arutz Sheva an Israeli news site He has given an_interview on another Web siteHis points in all of them boil down to this Israel should use the natural_gas it has found in the giant Leviathan field offshore in the eastern Mediterranean to build bridges to Greece and Cyprus and avoid dealing with Turkey at all costs Any extra gas could be sent to Egypt which Papadopoulos said already has liquefied natural_gas plants for importing gasHe also Israel to settle antitrust issues regarding its oil and gas industry by providing the regulatory certainty so that relatively large companies can exploit the natural_gas soonPapadopoulos who bears the same name as the Greek colonel who led a 1967 coup has also written the United_States should station a fleet of warships in Crete and that Cyprus should join NATOShipping the natural_gas to Turkey by pipeline and from there to the rest of Europe might be relatively inexpensive Papadopoulos has written but he said Israel should look elsewhere The Turkish option he in March 2014 is bereft of the political realities in the region and does_not take into account the potentially devastating impact this option can have on Israels strategic relations with EU member Cyprus and by extension all of Europe He writes Regional economic cooperation between Israel and Cyprus should be the guiding principle that anchors Israel economically to EuropeIn October 2015 he in Haaretz that Israels energy exports can serve as the basis for enhancing strategic relations between Israel and Egypt They could also serve as the foundation for political and security cooperation with Greece and CyprusElizabeth Rosenberg an energy expert at the Center for a New American Security said judging from the limited writing Papadopoulos has done that his approach wont square well with an American audience he lacks a strongcontemporary backgroundon domesticenergy issues She added that he has argued forIsraeli gas moving to Europe If that eventually comes to pass it willcompete with US gas to EuropeThe United_States andIsrael are allies butwhose team is he onPapadopoulos also wrote in January 2014 that Israel and Greeces robust military relations have redrawn the political map of the region The US would be wise to shift its policies and resources towards improving relations at all levels with its stalwart allies in the region Israel Greece and Cyprus to contain the newly emergent Russian fleet and malignant jihadist forces operating around Israels bordersEarier Papadopoulos wrote about terrorism for The Chicago Examiner and as an intern at the Jamestown Foundation In 2011 he wrote As history has explained to its readers the ancient Greek mythological hero Hercules fought the mythical hydra which

todays predicamentMichael Flynn the national_security adviser to President Trump resigned late Monday over revelations about his to the United_States and his misleading statements about the matter to senior Trump administration officialsFlynn stepped_down amid mounting pressure on the Trump administration to account for its false_statements about Flynns conduct after The Washington_Post reported Monday that the Justice_Department had warned the White_House last_month that Flynn had so mischaracterized his communications with the Russian diplomat that he might be vulnerable to blackmail by Moscow In his Flynn said he had inadvertently briefed the Vice_President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone_calls with the Russian_ambassador I have sincerely apologized to the president and the vice presidentFlynn was referring to his disproven claims to Vice_President Pence and others a month ago that he had never discussed US sanctions against Moscow with Russian_Ambassador Sergey_Kislyak Pence White_House spokesman Sean_Spicer and others relying on Flynns accounts publicly defended him and repeatedly declared in categorical terms that sanctions were never discussedPresident Trump accepted Flynns resignation letter and appointed Keith Kellogg a decorated retired Army lieutenant general as acting national_security adviserFlynns resignation after just 24 days on the job caps a decorated career in public service for the retired lieutenant general and intelligence officialKellogg is one of three candidates Trump is considering as a permanent replacement for Flynn according to a senior White_House official The other two are David H Petraeus a former CIA_director and retired general and a former deputy commander of the US Central CommandOne senior White_House official said that Trump did_not fire Flynn rather Flynn made the decision to resign on his own late Monday evening because of what this official said was the cumulative effect of damaging news coverage about his conversations with the Russian envoy This official who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the situation said Trump does_not relish firing people despite his television persona on The Apprentice and had intended to wait several more days before deciding whether to seek Flynns resignationThere obviously were a lot of issues but the president was hanging in there this official said Flynns departure just weeks into the Trump administration compounds the confusion in the National_Security Council that is supposed to serve as a disciplined coordination center for the administrations handling of international affairsInstead the White_House faces an escalating court fight over an immigration ban aimed_at Muslim-majority countries has alienated key allies with Trumps brusque phone_calls to foreign leaders and seemed so caught off-guard by North_Koreas that Trump and senior officials were shown in full view of patrons at Trumps Mar-a Lago resort Flynn was forced out less_than a week after it was disclosed that he had discussed US sanctions against Russia with that countrys ambassador before Trump was sworn in as presidentBut Flynns undoing was more directly tied to his inaccurate accounts of those contacts to senior Trump officials including Pence who officials said was incensed to learn that Flynn has not told him the truth Flynn again denied that he had discussed the subject in an_interview with The Washington_Post last_week only to back away from that statement a day later by acknowledging through a spokesman that while he couldnt recall speaking about sanctions he could not rule it outIn fact US intelligence and law_enforcement officials have said that sanctions were a main subject of Flynns conversation with Kislyak on the day that the Obama_administration announced a series of punitive measures aimed_at punishing Moscow for its meddling in the 2016 US presidential electionUS officials said that Flynn told Kislyak that Moscow should not overreact to the sanctions indicating that the two sides would soon be in position to revisit the matter presumably in Moscows favorIn conveying that message Flynn may have broken a law against unauthorized individuals negotiating with foreign_governments over conflicts He is unlikely to face legal sanction however because that law dates to 1799 and has never been used in a prosecutionBut Flynns departure is unlikely to end the trouble the issue has created for the Trump administration The_Post reported Monday that then-acting US attorney_general Sally Q Yates told the White_House counsel last_month that Flynns misleading statements to Pence and others whose own government would have known that sanctions were discussedThe White_House appears to have let its repeated false_statements about Flynn stand for weeks after that notification from Yates and has yet to account for what it did with the warning she conveyed The disclosures about Flynn have added to the swirling suspicion about the Trump administrations relationship with Moscow suspicion based in part on Trumps repeated expressions of Flynns resignation appears to end the career of a highly decorated US military intelligence_officer who served repeated tours in Afghanistan and Iraq but became a polarizing figure in last years presidential campaignIn a speech at the Republican_National Convention Flynn led vitriolic attacks on Democratic_nominee Hillary_Clinton leading chants of Lock_her up and declaring that if he had been even partly as careless as she was in her handling of sensitive material by email he would be in jail Flynn spent last weekend at Mar-a-Lago with Trump staffing the president during his visit with Japanese_Prime Minister_Shinzo Abe Back at the White_House on Monday Flynn attended classified briefings helped orchestrate the visit of Canadian Prime_Minister Justin Trudeau and led Trumps morning intelligence briefing this official saidSome of Trumps political advisers felt Flynn should not be fired in the midst of intense media scrutiny and calls for his resignation from Democratic opponentsPart of me said nobody should be firing this guy not on the day that Nancy_Pelosi said fire this guy the official said But by Monday evening Flynn had decided he could not surviveIt was when you feel like youre looking around the room and asking Wheres my friend the White_House official said The Pence thing was huge He is not somebody whos quick to anger That was very telling to everybodyFlynn presented his resignation letter to Trump roughly around 9 pm shortly_after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchins swearing-in ceremony in the Oval_Office Trump accepted the letterIt was a sad moment the White_House official saidIt took Stephen Colbert and Joe Scarborough all of two minutes to get to Kellyanne_Conway and the L-wordScarborough was a guest Tuesday night on Colberts Late_Show and he seemed eager to explain the decision to last weekIt got to a point where Kellyanne would keep coming out and everything she said was disproven like five_minutes later Scarborough said And it wasnt disproven by a fact-checker it was somebody else in the administration that would come out and actually say well actually no thats not trueTheres a quicker way to say that entire sentence Colbert replied She just liedScarborough a former Republican congressman from Florida is the host of Morning Joe Co-host Mika Brzezinski said earlier_this month that Conway tries to book herself on the show but I wont do it cause I dont believe in fake_news or information that is not true Every time Ive seen her on television somethings askew off or incorrect Conway was the person who ushered the phrase alternative facts into the popular American lexicon It was January on Meet the Press and host Chuck Todd was pressing her on why the White_House press_secretary made easily disproved claims about the size of Trumps inauguration crowdConway told Todd that White_House press_secretary Sean_Spicer had alternative factsAlternative facts are not facts Todd responded Theyre falsehoodsThe statement and Conways credibility took a hitTim OBrien (@obrienillustration Instagram) has created perhaps the ultimate visual on Andy Revkin (@Revkin) It got worse a few_days later when Conwayused the Bowling_Green massacre in justifying Trumps travel_ban saying most people dont_know about it because it didnt get coveredIt also didnt happen There has by terrorists or anyone elseConway said shed misspoken but The Washington_Posts Aaron Blake reported that On I meant to say Bowling_Green terrorists as reported here Kellyanne_Conway (@KellyannePolls) As The Posts the Morning Joe hosts have characterized Conway as an attention seeker who texts TV producers in a constant effort to get on air so she can speak for a White_House where she actually isnt in the knowBorchers wrote that the morning show hosts described Conway as pretty much like her caricature on Saturday Night LiveScarborough also used his time on the show to talk about Conways boss the president who they think based on his Twitter feed is an avid watcher Hes watched the show for years kind of goes in waves Well always look in the camera and say Donald we know youre not watching the show but how you doingColbert pushed back jesting about calling Trump Donald instead of Mr PresidentThe way hes acted over the past month has made it even harder to call him Mr President Scarborough repliedSince Trump took_office Colberts show has gotten more political a topical shift toward more timely material orchestrated by Chris Lichts takeover backstage In early February Colberts The Late_Show beat out Jimmy Fallons The Tonight Show for the first time since Colbert replaced David Letterman in September 2015And Colbert has kept pouring it on Last week he He has made fun of Trump calling the media and he hasA little-noticed court filing unsealed this week as part of special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_IIIs ongoing probe could have big consequences for his other targets showing hes willing to use suspects lawyers to provide evidence against themAfter unsealing a 12-count_indictment against Paul_Manafort the US District Court also unsealed an opinion from Chief Judge Beryl A Howell saying one of Manaforts former lawyers could be compelled to testify to the grand juryTypically such information is protected by attorney-client privilege a bedrock principle of US legal practice that says a lawyer must keep confidential what they are told by their clientsThere are some exceptions to that confidentiality including in instances where a suspect may have lied to his or her lawyer causing that lawyer to unwittingly lie to the government Howell ruled that in Manaforts case the exception applied and the attorney could be called to testify before the grand juryThe opinion is troubling because people make representations to the government all the time through their lawyers and I_think theres a general expectation of confidentiality behind the conversations that go into those representations said Peter D Hardy a partner at the Ballard Spahr law_firm Its widening a door thats not often used And the wider the door gets maybe the more people will use it Hardy said the use of what lawyers call the crime-fraud exception indicates the special_counsel team is highly intelligent highly aggressive and theyre_going to pursue legal theories that your average prosecutor will not use Will they use the specific theory again Its certainly possibleManafort is hardly the only person under_scrutiny who used lawyers to make government filings One of Muellers other key targets Michael_Flynn has also filed government papers regarding his work on behalf of another governmentNo public charges have been filed against Flynn former national_security adviser in the Trump administration but he remains under investigation according to officials familiar_with the matter who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigationIn the Manafort case the judge began her ruling by declaring This is a matter of national importance The ruling does_not identify Manaforts lawyer it refers to the attorney simply as the Witness but people_familiar with the case said it was Melissa Laurenza who was willing to testify if her clients consented which they did_not Neither Laurenza nor her lawyer responded to a request for comment TuesdayA Manafort spokesman also declined to commentAfter several hearings on the subject the judge decided prosecutors could ask the lawyer seven out of eight proposed questions ruling one went too far The judge said investigators had gathered enough evidence from other sources to justify questioning the lawyer though the details of that evidence were redacted from the court filingThat legal fight took_place under seal in September but the opinion was unsealed_Monday the same_day charges were announced against Manafort and his deputy_Rick GatesProsecutors also revealed Monday that a had pleaded_guilty and been cooperating with investigators for monthsIn Manaforts case prosecutors used information from his former lawyer to charge him with lying to the government about his work for a foreign government Ukraine While most of the indictment focuses on issues of alleged money_laundering conspiracy and failure to file reports to tax authorities the last two counts of the indictment say that Manafort and Gates knowingly and willfully caused to be made a false statement in a government filing required under the Foreign_Agents Registration_Act or FARA Court filings suggest those two charges stem in part from information provided by Manaforts former lawyerIn the FARA filing Manafort and Gates denied that their work on the part of Ukraines Party of Regions constituted lobbying on behalf of a foreign governmentJacob Frenkel a white-collar attorney at Dickinson Wright who previously worked in the Office of the Independent Counsel said Howells ruling was likely a critical one for prosecutors who otherwise would need to jump over and avoid altogether the communications with counselIt is invaluable to the FARA counts and to the issue of Manaforts state of mind more broadly in the indictment because an experienced credible lawyer is going to have instant credibility with a jury Frenkel saidFrenkel said that the ruling was written in such a way that Howell seemed to believe it would be appealedThe attorneys testimony will be central to an actual case if this case ever gets there Frenkel saidWith the guilty plea of one Trump campaign official and a 31-page indictment of two others special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III spoke volumes more about the Russia probe than months of heated public debate Without uttering a word Muellers message was clear according to veteran lawyers He isnt bluffing and witnesses are talkingThe double-barreled court_filings ratchet up the pressure on everyone under_scrutiny in the investigation lawyers said in part because they show that a former Trump campaign adviser began cooperating with the FBI three months_ago This is the way you kick off a big case said Patrick Cotter a white-collar defense lawyer in Chicago who once worked as a federal_prosecutor in New_York alongside Andrew Weissmann who is spearheading the prosecution of former Trump campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort and his deputy_Rick Gates Prosecutors also announced a guilty plea from former campaign adviser George_Papadopoulos about his interactions with people linked to the Russian_government Papadopoulos has who questioned him about those contacts according to court recordsOh man they couldnt have sent a message any clearer if theyd rented a revolving neon sign in Times Square Cotter said And the message isnt just about Manafort Its a message to the next five guys they talk to And the message is We are coming and we are not playing and we are not bluffingThe special_counsel also appears to be moving fastWhite-collar cases often begin by flipping bit players far down the chain of command The prosecution team that sent WorldCom chief_executive Bernie Ebbers to prison for decades began with charges_against a low-level accountant Prosecutors then worked their way up the corporate ladder flipping senior managers until they had a case against EbbersAnd as Mueller probes whether Trump associates conspired with Russian_government actors to influence the 2016_presidential election he already has a cooperator at the lower rungs of the campaign Papadopoulos The prosecutors court_filings say that Papadopoulos sought to arrange a meeting between officials with the Trump campaign and the Russian_government and talked to people connected to the Russian_government about providing dirt on Democratic candidate Hillary ClintonPeter Zeidenberg a former federal_prosecutor with expertise in national_security called the Papadopoulos plea a big deal because it goes much closer to the issue of collusionThe fact that hes been cooperating for three months is important too he said Who else is cooperating that we dont_know about Thats what people in the White_House need to be worried aboutWhile the Papadopoulos court_filings offer more links_between Trump associates and Russian figures they do not define the extent to which senior campaign officials supported that effortIts not a direct connection as yet said Daniel E Toomey a former prosecutor in Washington There are additional bread crumbs that are missing leading to the White HouseToomey called the indictment of Manafort and Gates extraordinarily intricate and said it will put enormous pressure on the defendants to cooperate This becomes a paper case The documents speak for themselves he said This case by my estimation will take months to try The cost of the litigation for Manafort will be in the millions of dollars Veteran lawyers described the indictment as daunting alleging $18 million worth of money_laundering which prosecutors said in court could mean more_than a dozen years in prisonThe indictment even seems to go out of its way to kneecap a standard defense argument in such cases that the defendant got bad advice from his accountant The indictment charges that Manafort wrote specifically to his accountant that he did_not have foreign_bank accounts Nick Akerman a former assistant special Watergate prosecutor said the court_filings all spell bad news for President TrumpAkerman said he could not see any defense to the Manafort indictmentHe has no choice but to plead guilty Thats what the indictment says to me he said The only defense that youve got is to go in there and start singing like a canary to avoid jail time And once he starts singing one of the tunes is bound to be Donald Trump But Jay Nanavati a former Justice_Department tax prosecutor said the filing of the indictment shows that so_far prosecutors have not been able to convince Manafort to cooperate but this is still how you start moving up the ladder in any organizationWhats striking about the indictment Nanavati said is the number of people who worked for Manafort accountants lawyers and others who provided key evidence against him That could be an ominous warning for other subjects of the probe like former national_security adviser_Michael Flynn who used lawyers to make official statements to the government that have now come into question And unidentified lobbying_firms indirectly hired by Manafort he said are in significant trouble because of the written exchanges referenced in the indictment alleging that some people at the firms were aware that Manafort was lying about their work togetherNanavati said a key change in US tax enforcement that began in 2008 going after foreign_bank accounts controlled by Americans probably played an important role in the case against Manafort Before the Justice_Department started cracking through the layers of Swiss banking secrecy that hid Americans accounts in 2008 he said the requirement on Americans to declare foreign_bank accounts was on the books but basically nobody ever did it and almost no one ever got prosecuted for it That changed in 2008 and tax return preparers started asking With the decline of bank secrecy Nanavati said crimes such as tax evasion and money_laundering through foreign accounts became harder to hide and made the charges_against Manafort easier to bringA key leader of the tax enforcement effort was then-Justice Department lawyer Kevin DowningDowning is now Manaforts defense lawyer Outside court on Monday he blasted the governments indictment for claiming his client committed crimes via foreign_bank accounts To claim that maintaining such accounts to bring all your funds into the United_States as a scheme to conceal from the United_States government is ridiculous Downing saidTaking off his glasses and affecting a somber tone Stephen Colbert encouraged his viewers to never fjorget the people who didnt die in a Swedish terrorist attack that never happenedThen a video montage flashed images of the Swedes who were not lost Swedish Fish Ikea the pop group Abba even the Muppet known as Colbert went on the air with new material on Presidents Day and the Late_Show host had some low-hanging fruit to work withAt a Florida rally on Saturday President Trump mentioned several countries that had been attacked by terrorists after taking in refugeesWeve got to keep our_country safe he said You look at whats_happening in Germany You look at whats_happening last night in Sweden Sweden who would believe thisThe answer according to Colbert No one would believe that but maybe someone who skips their intelligence briefingsTrump later said his statements were in response to something hed seen on Fox NewsMy statement as to whats_happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on concerning immigrants & Sweden Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) In_addition to being simply inaccurate Saturdays statements about Sweden were the third time Trump or people in his administration had tried to make a policy point by talking_about an attack by foreign terrorists that didnt in fact happenTragically Sweden is the third not-a-terrorist attack that hasnot shocked the world in the last_month Colbert said First there wasnt the Bowling_Green massacre then no one was lost in Atlanta And now its not Swedens turn When will it begin Earlier this month White_House counselor Kellyanne_Conway

cars on fires and looted shops In total police were investigating a case of vandalism and aggravated thefts three incidents of violent rioting and three assaults including one against a police officerPreet Bharara one of the most high-profile federal_prosecutors in the country said he was fired Saturday after refusing to submit a letter of resignation as part of an ouster of the remaining US attorneys who were holdovers from the Obama_administration according to people_familiar with the matterBhararas dismissal was an about-face from President Trumps assurances to the Manhattan-based prosecutor in November weeks after the election that he wanted him to stay on the job following a meeting at Trump_Tower according to BhararaTwo people close to Trump said the presidents chief_strategist Stephen_K Bannon and Attorney_General Jeff_Sessions wanted a clean slate of federal_prosecutors and were unconcerned about any perception that the White_House changed its mind about Bharara The removal of former president_Barack Obamas federal_prosecutors is about asserting whos in power the two saidThe departure of Bharara the US attorney for the Southern_District of New_York capped a confusing sequence of events beginning Friday when acting deputy attorney_general Dana Boente began making calls to 46 prosecutors asking for their resignations by the end of the day Requests for resignation are a normal part of a transition of power from one administration to another although both the Bush and Obama_administrations let their US attorneys leave gradually During Fridays call with Bharara the New_York prosecutor asked for clarity about whether the requests for resignations applied to him given his previous conversation with Trump and did_not immediately get a definitive answer according to a person_familiar with the exchangeWhen asked Friday whether Bharara was also being asked for a resignation letter one White_House official not authorized to speak_publicly said Everybodys gone and would not engage further on the issueOn Saturday morning when the administration had still not received Bhararas resignation Boente attempted to call the US attorney to find out why but the two_men did_not immediately connect according to people_familiar with the discussionsWhen they finally did speak shortly_before 230 pm Boente informed Bharara that the order to submit his resignation indeed applied to him because he was a presidentially appointed US attorney according to a Justice_Department official with knowledge of the conversationBharara asked Boente if he was firing him and Boente replied that he was asking him to submit his resignation the official saidMinutes later Bharara announced on Twitter that he was out I did_not resign Bharara said Moments ago I was fired Being the US Attorney in SDNY will forever be the greatest honor of my professional lifeBharara sent an email to his staff asserting again that Boente had removed him from his jobNeedless to say it is personally very sad for me the note said This is the greatest place on Earth and I love you all Even on a day when your US Attorney gets fired it is still Thanksgiving because you all still get to do the most honorable work there is to doBharara added that the office could not be in better hands than with the deputy US attorney for the Southern_District of New_York Joon H Kim whom he called a tremendous leader and public servant and who loves the office just as much as I doWithin the Justice_Department some are questioning whether a recent phone_call from Trump to Bharara may have contributed to the decision to remove the Obama holdovers according to a person_familiar with the matterOn Thursday a White_House aide called and left a message for Bharara saying the president wanted to speak with him though the prospective topic of discussion was unclear Bharara consulted his staff and determined that it would probably be a violation of Justice_Department protocols for him to speak directly to the president this person said That protocol exists in order to prevent political interference or the appearance of political interference with Justice_Department workBharara then contacted the chief of staff for the attorney_general Jody Hunt told him of his own determination and the two agreed that it would be a violation of the Justice_Department protocol for Bharara to call the president back Bharara then called the White_House staffer who had left the message and said he wouldnt be talking to the president and explained why this person said Its unclear_whether the Trump call and its aftermath had anything to do with Fridays decision Bharara who was born in India and came to the United_States as a child had a particularly powerful perch in the criminal justice system The Southern_District of New_York has 220 assistant US attorneys making it one of the largest federal_prosecutors offices in the countryDuring his tenure Bharara indicted 17 prominent New_York politicians for malfeasance 10of them Democrats Along with his bipartisan prosecutions Bharara developed a reputation for being tough on insider trading although he was criticized for the lack of prosecutions that followed the financial crisisBharara was an outspoken man in a job that has been held by vocal and politically aspirant predecessors including former New_York mayor Rudolph W Giuliani and FBI_Director James_B ComeyThere is no_indication that the ouster of Bharara stems from a disagreement about a particular case or investigation While the FBI has been conducting a counterintelligence inquiry looking for evidence of contacts_between agents of the Russian_government and Trump campaign advisers and a former campaign adviser to Trump has been part of an investigation_into possible overseas corruption there have been no signs that Bhararas office has been involved in either of those probes or any other inquiries that might touch on the president or people close to him On Wednesday watchdog groups Bharara to probe whether Trump has received payments or other benefits from foreign_governments through his business_interests in violation of the Constitutions emoluments_clause which prohibits top officials from receiving favors or payments from foreign governmentsThe president complained on Twitter earlier_this month that Obama had ordered wiretapping of Trump_Tower during the election season an accusation that multiple federal law_enforcement officials have said is untrue partly because presidents cannot order the FBI to wiretap Americans and also because no such surveillance was undertaken But Bharara was not drawn into that debate which principally revolved around the Justice_Department and FBI headquartersInitially after Trump won the presidency it looked as if Bhararas position was safe Trump brought up Bhararas name in November during a phone conversation with Sen Charles_E Schumer (D-NY) whom the president-elect was calling to congratulate on becoming the leader of the Senate Democrats according to people_familiar with the matter In that conversation Trump said he was thinking of keeping Bharara in his job these people said Schumer praised Bharara and Trump then arranged a meeting with Bharara at Trump TowerDuring the conversation Trump told Bharara to call Sessions his nominee for attorney_general who also asked Bharara to stay people_familiar with the conversation saidWhen Bharara was leaving according to one person he asked the president-elect what he should tell the reporters in the lobby Trump told Bharara to tell them he was staying on this person saidBharara told_reporters afterward that the president-elect presumably because hes a New_Yorker and is aware of the great work that our office has done over the past seven years asked to meet with him and discuss whether he would remain in his positionWe had a good meeting Bharara

meeting held during last years presidential campaign between Donald Trump Jr and a Russian lawyer raises new questions about how the key session came togetherThe note was written by the Russian lawyer and sent to a music promoter who had helped arrange the sessionIt could offer evidence backing up the Russian lawyers claims that she was meeting with Trump Jr solely to discuss a 2012 law despised by the Kremlin that imposed financial sanctions on wealthy Russians as punishment for human_rights abusesThat is the version of events the lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya has asserted in media interviews since the New_York Times first disclosed the Trump_Tower meeting in JulyBut her version conflicts with explosive correspondence released previously that shows the music promoter told Trump Jr before the meeting that Veselnitskaya would bring damaging_information about Hillary_Clinton on behalf of the Russian_government to help the Trump campaignThe newly disclosed email was provided to The Washington_Post by Scott Balber a US lawyer representing Aras_Agalarov the Russian billionaire who hosted the Trump-owned Miss_Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013 and who had helped secure the Trump_Tower meeting for VeselnitskayaBalber said he was releasing the email from Veselnitskaya because he thinks it bolsters his clients claim that the Trump_Tower meeting was not part of a Russian_government effort to assist President Trumps campaign despite what music publicist Rob Goldstone had writtenThe newly disclosed email shows Veselnitskaya wrote Goldstone on the morning of the scheduled meeting to ask whether she could bring a lobbyist and trusted associateThe lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin is working to advance these issues with several congressmen she continued He has invaluable knowledge about the positions held by the members of the Foreign_Relations Committee that will be important to our discussionAt the time Veselnitskaya was preparing to testify before the congressional committee about the law the Magnitsky ActThe email offers no conclusive evidence about why Trump Jr accepted the meeting with Russians as his father prepared to accept the Republican nomination for president Trump Jr had reacted enthusiastically when told over email by Goldstone that Agalarov had met with a top prosecutor in Russia and been provided incriminating information about Clinton that the Russian lawyer would conveyIf its what you say I love it Trump Jr wroteBalbers clients also include Agalarovs pop star son Emin who is represented by Goldstone and asked Goldstone to set_up a meeting He also represents Ike Kaveladze a US-based employee of the Agalarovs Agalarov denies that he met with a Russian prosecutor about the US presidential campaign as Goldstone wroteBalber said Veselnitskaya provided him with the email during an_interview in Moscow last_month which he conducted to better understand how the Trump_Tower meeting came together by speaking to the person who had first requested itMy clients have been implicated in my view unfairly in some theory that they were involved in an effort to influence the election campaign by providing some secret damaging_information about Hillary_Clinton he said The documents he said are consistent with what my clients have saidVeselnitskaya did_not respond to a request for commentBalber said Veselnitskaya also provided him a detailed account of how she secured the meetingHer account began when she was extended an offer to testify at a June 14 2016 congressional hearing about the Magnitsky_Act by US Rep Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif) an advocate of closer ties with Russia The_Post has reported that her testimony was ultimately scuttled after opposition from Foreign_Affairs Committee_Chairman Edward R Royce (R-Calif)Veselnitskaya has said she was interested in the Magnitsky_Act issue on behalf of a private client She was working closely in the United_States with Akhmetshin a Russian American lobbyist who has been accused of having ties to Russian intelligence He has denied ties to the Russian governmentVeselnitskaya told Balber that she met with a series of well-connected Russians in early June_2016 to discuss her upcoming trip to the United_States One person with whom she met was Agalarov for whom she had previously done legal workVeselnitskaya told Balber she did_not seek a meeting with the Trump campaign but was surprised and pleased when Agalarov explained his business connection to the presidential_candidate and offered to make a connection Veselnitskaya told Agalarov that she had in October 2015 provided information intended to undermine the US law to Yuri Chaika the Russian prosecutor general Balber said Balber said he believes it is possible Veselnitskayas statement resulted in a misunderstanding about the prosecutors roleRobert Gage an attorney for Goldstone declined to commentBy June 7 2016 Goldstone had confirmed that Veselnitskaya and her translator were confirmed to meet with the candidates son along with top campaign aide Paul_Manafort and Trumps_son-in-law Jared_Kushner Two days later Veselnitskaya sent the email asking if she could bring AkhmetshinAkhmetshin has previously told The_Post that he was invited to the meeting at the last minute after having lunch in New_York City with Veselnitskaya where she asked his advice on what to say The newly released email shows Veselnitskaya asked Goldstone if the lobbyist could attend at 924 am not after lunch and that she wrote she had a signed a nondisclosure agreement with AkhmetshinMichael Tremonte a lawyer for Akhmetshin said that the lobbyist was invited to the meeting over lunchHe has no recollection of signing a nondisclosure agreement in connection with the meeting and was not

issuing instructions for developing the Korean revolution on a higher stageThe prominence put on the economy at the first to be held in 36 years underscores the emphasis that Kim the third-generation leader of North_Korea has placed on improving living standards and at the same_time pursuing nuclear_weapons But it is something of a risky move for Kim because he could be held accountable for itAlso at the congress which got underway Friday Kim said North_Korea would not use its nuclear_weapons unless its sovereignty was violated a familiar refrain from Pyongyang which presents its nuclear and missile program as necessary for self-defense Kim has lauded North_Koreas advances in nuclear technology as South_Korean officials continue to warn that a fifth test could be imminentThe surprisingly full remarks from Kim were reported on North_Koreas state television and in the official media Sunday Foreign journalists allowed to travel to Pyongyang for the congress have not been given any access to the forum apart from being taken to a street corner across from the venueThe agenda for the congress includes a review of the partys work and rules the election of Kim to the top position in the party and the filling of other senior positions according to the Norths official Korean_Central News AgencyAnalysts seized on the news that Kim has announced a plan for developing which remains in dire shape despite growing modestly in the past few years International sanctions_imposed this year after nuclear and ballistic_missile tests are expected to create additional challenges Michael Madden who runs the site said the plan is a big deal because Kim is taking public responsibility for economic_development something his father never didIt has appeared that Kim has been trying to rule like his grandfather Kim_Il Sung who placed more importance on the Workers_Party than on the military His father and predecessor Kim_Jong Il promoted a military first policyThe announcement of a five-year economic plan slightly proves the hypothesis that Kim_Jong Un is ruling like his grandfather he even appropriated a Kim_Il Sung policy direction here with more formal lines of control and authority like a five-year economic plan Madden saidIn an address at the congress Kim announced a five-year strategy for the state economic_development from 2016 to 2020 Such plans are commonplace in communist systems but North_Korea hasnt produced one since the 1980sKim said that the period since the last Workers_Party congress was an unprecedentedly grim struggle in North_Koreas long history Over the next five_years North_Korea should fly the flag of victory and become a scientific and technological economic and highly civilized power Kim saidIt is imperative to carry through the five-year strategy for the state economic_development from 2016 to 2020 Kim reportedly told the congress It is necessary to further increase the might of the politico-ideological power and military powerAlthough there were few other details analysts said it was remarkable that Kim had spoken publicly about his plans for economic_growth His father who died in 2011 and presided over a period of economic devastation and widespread famine did_not utter public statements that he could be held accountable forBut Kim_Jong Un has been promoting a byungjin or simultaneous pursuit policy under which he has been trying to grow the economy and develop nuclear_weapons and ballistic_missiles to deliver them The Souths Bank of Korea estimates that the Norths economy has been growing at about 1 or 2percent a year but Andrei Lankov a North_Korea specialist at Kookmin University in Seoul agrees with other analysts who think that its growth has been much higher potentially as high as the 7percent estimate from the Hyundai Economic Research Institute in SeoulRecent events also prove that North_Korea is making technical advances on its weapons_program North_Korean scientists would have learned more about their technical abilities and shortcomings during the nuclear_test in January and a long-range rocket_launch in February They would also have learned from their more Jeffrey_Lewis an arms control expert at the Center for Nonproliferation_Studies in California has saidDuring the congress Kim repeated the line that North_Korea would not go on the offensive with its weaponsAs a responsible nuclear_weapons state our republic will not use a nuclear_weapon unless its sovereignty is encroached upon by any aggressive hostile forces with nukes Kim told the meeting according to KCNAPlans to deploy an American antimissile_battery to South_Korea and the growing North_Korean threat will be at the top of James Mattiss agenda this week when the new defense secretary visits South_Korea and Japan on his first foreign tripMattis a retired Marine general nicknamed Mad Dog will meet with Han Min-koo the South_Korean defense minister in Seoul on Thursday before heading to Tokyo Han is expected to reiterate South_Koreas commitment to hosting the Terminal_High Altitude Aerial Defense system or THAADBut with China exacting economic revenge on South_Korea over its and the South_Korean government in crisis some in Seoul now have jitters about the planMoon Jae-in an opposition candidate running at the top of the presidential polls has said decisions on the THAAD_deployment should wait until the next South_Korean administration is in placeThat could take months with the Constitutional_Court now deciding whether to uphold the National Assemblys motion to impeach President Park_Geun-hye who made the decision to host THAAD for her role in a sensational political scandal If the court forces her from office elections must be held within 60 days Otherwise they will take_place in December as scheduled In the meantime the Chinese government which has made no secret of its opposition to the THAAD plan is trying to persuade South_Korean political leaders to change their mindsAlthough Washington and Seoul insist that its purpose is to guard against the threat of North_Korean missiles Beijing views the system as another attempt to curtail its military expansionIn recent_weeks China has slapped a number of trade sanctions on South_Korea in an apparent effort to dissuade Seoul from going ahead with the deploymentChina is one of the biggest reasons why people are opposing THAAD and I would say that its based on reasonable concerns said Kim Dong-yub of the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul Just go into a department store and you can feel the change he said referring to the sudden drop in Chinese_tourists coming to South KoreaIn the past month China has banned imports of South_Korean bidet toilet seats and South_Korean cosmetics which are hugely popular among young women who love Korean dramas Classical musicians have joined K-pop stars in having visas denied and concerts canceled Meanwhile department stores in China run by Lotte the South_Korean retail group have been subject to a sudden flurry of safety and hygiene inspections and tax audits although Beijing rejects any suggestion that this is related to THAADLotte owns the country club 200 miles from Seoul earmarked for the THAAD_battery It will swap with the government for another parcel of landLotte appeared to be taking it slow with the internal procedures needed to be completed before the swap can take_place a possible sign that it is worried about the impact on its business in China It has more_than 150 stores in China and is building a huge retail and amusement park complex in the southwestern city of ChengduChinese tourists accounted for more_than 70percent of Lotte Duty Frees sales in the first quarter of last_year It is true that we are sandwiched between our role as a South_Korean enterprise South_Koreas relations with China and possible economic loss the Yonhap_News Agency quoted a senior Lotte official as saying Small South_Korean companies are suffering too There has been a sharp decrease in Chinese_tourists said Kim Seo-kyung who owns a clothing store in Myeongdong a fashion district in Seoul usually teeming with Chinese shoppersMaybe its because of THAAD and because the relationship between South_Korea and China has soured Kim said She estimated that her revenue had fallen about 40percent since last yearBusinesses around South_Korea reported a sharp drop in tourist numbers over the Lunar New Year holiday this past weekendAmerican proponents of THAAD say they hope South_Korean authorities will not waverThe THAAD is a far more effective ballistic_missile defense_system than anything South_Korea has or will have for decades said Bruce Klingner a Northeast Asia specialist at the Heritage_Foundation To not deploy THAAD is to choose to put South_Korea and US forces stationed there at grave risk to North_Korean nuclear chemical and biological attackNorth Koreas Kim_Jong Un has overseen the test of a solid-fuel_rocket engine state media announced Thursday claiming a major technological advancement that could greatly increase Pyongyangs ability to strike other countries including the United StatesExperts are working to verify North_Koreas latest boast but if true it would mark another worrying development in the states pursuit of weapons of mass destructionThis is dangerous said senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation_Studies in Monterey CalifBased on the images we have we cant say whether this is functional she said But at this point we need to stop thinking about whether they have this technology or not because if they dont have it now they will have it soon and we need to start preparing for that dayNorth Koreas Korean_Central News_Agency (KCNA) on Thursday published a photo of Kim with the rocket against a graffiti-style sign that read Ruthless thunderbolt of fire for the American imperialists and Park Geun-hyes clique Park is the president of South_Korea and has been adopting an increasingly tough line against the North KCNA said Kim ordered the launch of a high-power solid-fuel_rocket engine that was designed and manufactured by the Korean styleThe engine spewed out huge flames with a deafening boom it saidThe engine would boost the power of ballistic rockets capable of mercilessly striking hostile forces the report said noting Kims great pleasure and satisfaction with what KCNA said was a successful testNorth Koreas rockets and missiles have been powered by a Soviet-era liquid-fuel engine which has to be loaded at the launch site That takes time which gives satellites an opportunity to spot activity taking placeBut solid-fuel rockets can be deployed much more quickly meaning there could be much less warning if any of a North_Korean missile_launch experts saidIf solid-fuel rockets are on mobile launchers which can be hidden in tunnels or buildings and wheeled out when theyre needed they could be deployed anywhere at short notice Analysts are now poring over photos to estimate the size of the rocket and glean any other details they can about its capability But in Seoul South_Koreas defense ministry was taking the claim seriouslyMoon Sang-gyun a spokesman for the defense ministry told_reporters Thursday that the military is preparing countermeasuresSeparately to be fully prepared to aggressively cope with North_Koreas reckless provocations her spokesman said Thursday The previous day North_Korea had threatened to North_Korea has a habit of making boasts that do not appear true as it continues work on nuclear_weapons and the means to deliver themIn recent months Pyongyang has claimed to have developed and a submarine-launched_ballistic missile Neither claim is borne out by seismic data and photo analysis experts say This month Kim claimed that North_Korea was able to miniaturize a nuclear_warhead Analysts were skeptical although US military leaders say it is only a matter of time until North_Korea masters this technologyNorth Korea is clearly making progress in some areas It is conducting frequent medium- and long-range missile_tests and every test enables its scientists to fix problems and improve capabilityThis should be a concern for American policymakers Hanham saidWe have a laundry list of things that we dont_want North_Korea to have We dont_want them to be road mobile we dont_want them to have longer ranges we dont_want them to have compact warheads we dont_want them to have solid-fuel motors she said The North_Koreans are basically going down that list and ticking everything offNorth Korea defiantly celebrated its fifth nuclear_test Friday claiming that it can now make warheads small enough to fit onto a missile and warning its enemies specifically the United_States that it has the ability to counter any attackAlthough the Norths proclaimed advancements could not be verified and Pyongyang has a track record of exaggeration the test appeared to mark another step toward North_Koreas goal of putting a nuclear_warhead on a weapon_capable of reaching the mainland United StatesFridays test the Norths second this year underscored the ability of Kim_Jong Uns_regime to make progress on its nuclear and missile_programs despite waves of international sanctions and isolation This is our response to hostile powers including the United_States We are sending out a message that if the enemies attack us we can counterattack Ri Chun Hee a veteran North_Korean newsreader said on state television We will_continue taking measures to protect our dignity and our right to exist from the American threat The test also appeared to be much bigger than North_Koreas previous four detonations since its first in 2006The US Geological Survey detected an artificial near North_Koreas nuclear_test site at 9 am local time on Friday a national holiday marking the 68th anniversary of the formation of the communist regime by Kim_Il Sung the current leaders grandfatherThis is clearly a nuclear_test said Jeffrey_Lewis director of the East_Asia nonproliferation program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation_Studies in Monterey Calif He estimated the size at between 10 and 20 kilotons The Norths last nuclear_test carried_out in January was about six kilotonsThe test happened just a few hours after President Obamas plane stopped in Japan to refuel on his way home from Laos where he attended a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) The president talked to South_Koreas president Park_Geun-hye who was still in Laos and Japanese_Prime Minister_Shinzo Abe said White_House press_secretary Josh EarnestIn a White_House statement Friday Obama called the test a grave threat to regional and international security and noted Pyongyangs claims to be developing nuclear_warheads capable of hitting the United_States and its alliesThe United_States does_not and never will accept North_Korea as a nuclear state Obama said Far from achieving its stated national_security and economic_development goals North_Koreas provocative and destabilizing actions have instead served to isolate and impoverish its people through its relentless pursuit of nuclear_weapons and ballistic_missile capabilities He said the latest test shows that North_Korea has no interest in being a responsible member of the international communityAfter consulting by phone with the South_Korean and Japanese leaders Obama said they would work with the UN_Security Council and international_community to impose significant penalties including new sanctions He also vowed to push ahead with deployment of a Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defense_(THAAD) battery in South_Korea and pledged to provide extended deterrence guaranteed by the full spectrum of US defense capabilitiesAt a news_conference Thursday in Laos Obama dismissed Chinas objections to the THAAD_deployment saying he told Chinese President_Xi Jinping that we cannot have a situation where were unable to defend either ourselves or our treaty allies against increasingly provocative behavior and escalating capabilities by the North_Koreans Obama added And I indicated to him that if the THAAD bothered him particularly since it has no purpose other than defensive and does_not change the strategic balance between the United_States and China that they need to work with us more effectively to change Pyongyangs behavior China the closest thing North_Korea has to an ally issued a statement resolutely opposing the test which it said took_place despite the widespread objection of the international communityWe strongly urge North_Korea to keep its promise to denuclearize to abide by relevant resolutions from the UN_Security Council and to stop making any moves that worsen the situation the statement from Chinas Foreign_Ministry saidIn its official announcement of what it said was a nuclear_warhead explosion test North_Korea claimed that it had been able to make smaller lighter and diversified nuclear_warheads of higher strike powerThis has definitely put on a higher level the [countrys] technology of mounting nuclear_warheads on ballistic rockets said the statement carried by the official Korean_Central News_Agency Kim has been ordering speedy progress on missile development as evidenced by recent salvos of medium-range missiles and has been making observable gains with nuclear devices But there remains no clear evidence that North_Koreas scientists have been able to put the two together to make a warhead that can be delivered to a targetHowever a growing number of analysts and American military chiefs believe it is just a matter of time until North_Korea masters this technologyThis test seemed to have a dual purpose said Yang Moo-jin a professor at the University of North_Korean Studies in SeoulDomestically Kim_Jong Un wants to present himself as a strong leader standing strong against the US he said He suggested that this could be because Kim at 32 is young but also perhaps because recent high-level defections have raised speculation of cracks in the regimeInternationally this test is designed to show that sanctions_imposed against North_Korea and international pressure are not working Theyre urging the world to accept its failure and revise its North_Korea policy Yang saidFridays test highlights North_Koreas continued defiance but also the ineffectiveness of even the most recent waves of tough sanctions_imposed after the nuclear_test in January analysts saidThe whole expectation eight or nine months_ago was that sanctions were finally going to bring North_Korea to heel but clearly that is not the case said David Kang a professor of international relations at the University of Southern California Clearly they respond to pressure with pressure of their own Still the international_community is expected to look for ways to inflict more pain on North_Korea which is already under sweeping sanctionsNorth Koreas desperate dependence on nuclear development is testimony to Kim_Jong Uns fanatical recklessness said Park the South_Korean president who cut short her visit to Laos to return to Seoul North_Koreas provocations will do nothing but accelerate its self-destructionIn Tokyo prime_minister Abe also struck an angry toneIf North_Korea conducted a nuclear_test I cant absolutely tolerate it he said We have to strongly protestAfter North_Koreas nuclear_test in January which the regime claimed was of a hydrogen_bomb and a long-range ballistic_missile test in February the UN_Security Council imposed tough new sanctionsIt ordered a ban on mineral exports from North_Korea a major source of income for the regime and strict inspections of all cargo going in and out of the country The United_States followed with new financial sanctions and by designating Kim_Jong Un by name for human_rights abuses South_Korea has also taken a strident approach closing an inter-Korean industrial park that had been a major source of revenue for the regimeBut Kim has not wavered testing a range of missiles this year and apparently making some technological progress including on a submarine-launched_ballistic missileTheres now obvious progress in North_Koreas nuclear and missile_programs They seem to be making precisely the technical progress that people dont_want said Euan Graham a security expert at the Lowy Institute in Sydney who once served as a British diplomat in Pyongyang North_Korea is obviously prepared to take the economic pain and is able to continue to materially supply the two programs On Monday North_Korea launched three medium-range missiles as China was hosting a meeting of Group of 20 leaders including Obama The rockets flew 620 miles falling inside_Japans air defense identification zoneA day after those launches the Security_Council issued its latest condemnationThe members of the Security_Council deplore all the Democratic_Peoples Republic of Koreas ballistic_missile activities including these launches noting that such activities contribute to [its] development of nuclear_weapons delivery systems and increase tension the council said in statement Tuesday using North_Koreas official nameAnalysts expect another_round of discussions on ways to put pressure on North KoreaSanctions and targeted financial measures may take time to have an impact on the regimes financial condition said Bruce Klingner a northeast Asia specialist at the Heritage_Foundation a conservative Washington-based think tankThe difficulty Klingner said would be in maintaining international resolve Sanctions can not be effectively implemented without the support of ChinaChinas implementation of sanctions has been patchy in the past and some analysts are concerned that Beijing angered by South_Koreas decision to host an American anti-missile battery might lose its appetite for enforcement William Branigin in Washington Yoonjung_Seo in Seoul Gu Jinglu in Beijing and Yuki Oda in Tokyo contributed to this reportNorth Korea fired a ballistic_missile Sunday morning its first provocation since Donald Trump was elected president of the United_States and one that sets up a test for the new administration in WashingtonThe missile was fired shortly_before 8am local time from a known test_site in North Pyongan province in the west of the country not far from the border with China and flew over the Korean_Peninsula and into the Sea of Japan South_Koreas joint chiefs of staff saidThe launch happened while President Trump was hosting Japanese_Prime Minister_Shinzo Abe at his golf resort in Florida In a brief joint appearance after the news of the missile_test the two presented a united front Abe called the test absolutely intolerable He said that in his summit with Trump at the White_House on Friday the president assured me the United_States will always stand with Japan 100 percentAfter Abe spoke Trump who had been standing behind him took the microphone and said I just want everybody to understand and fully know that the United_States of America stands behind Japan its great ally 100percentTrump did_not mention South_Korea also an important US ally Neither leader answered questionsSouth Koreas military leaders were still working to analyze data from the projectile but said it appeared to be a medium-range Musudan missile the type that North_Korea had been trying to perfect last_year The Musudan is technically capable of flying as far as 2400 miles putting Guam within range and almost reaching Alaska But the joint chiefs said this missile appeared to fly only 300 miles The military is determining if the missile is a modified Musudan intermediate-range ballistic_missile or the shorter range Rodong missile a military official told the Souths Yonhap_News AgencyBut some analysts thought the launch could have been the first stages of an_intercontinental ballistic_missile capable of reaching the United StatesI think were all waiting for the first two stages of the ICBM said Jeffrey_Lewis of the Center for Nonproliferation_Studies at the Middlebury_Institute of International_Studies They finished testing that engine on the stand so now its time to test it in the airI dont_think this [missile test] is designed to respond to Trump I_think this is part of Kim_Jong Uns continued efforts to try to advance his programs said Jon Wolfsthal a senior nonproliferation official in the Obama_administration now at Harvards Belfer Center But it has the added effect of calling Trumps bluff The real question is not what North_Korea has done but what the US is going to do about it he saidKims regime has declared a goal of producing an_intercontinental missile that can deliver a nuclear payload to the United_States and last_year appeared to be making a concerted effort toward achieving that goal It conducted two nuclear_tests and dozens of missile_tests including eight Musudan tests Only one in June was a success flying about 250miles and reaching a surprisingly high altitudeBut the regime had not fired any since October perhaps to avoid influencing domestic politics in the United_States ahead of the presidential_election and in South_Korea where the conservative president has been impeached and there is now a good chance of a progressive administration that is friendlier to PyongyangIn his New Years address Kim said that North_Korea had test-fired in various ways for a nuclear strike to cope with the imperialists nuclear war threats and said that the country had entered the final stage of preparation for the test launch of intercontinental_ballistic missile In response Trump tweeted North_Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear_weapon capable of reaching parts of the US It wont happenBut apart from repeating the usual pledges to work to stop North_Korea from reaching its nuclear goals the Trump administration has said little on what it would do to stop Kim The administration is understood to be embarking on a view of North_Korea after eight years in which the Obama_administration practiced strategic patience hoping that it could wait out North KoreaIn Seoul the national_security council convened a meeting and acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn said the South_Korean government would work with its allies to ensure a concerted response to punish North_Korea John Wagner in Florida and David Nakamura in Washington contributed to this reportNorth Korea fired three medium-range ballistic_missiles into the sea off its east coast Monday landing close to Japan in a show of force that coincided with the meeting of leaders of the worlds 20 largest economies in neighboring ChinaNorth Korea launched the missiles believed to be Rodongs from a site south of Pyongyang at 1214 pm local time South_Koreas military said They flew about 600_miles and landed well inside_Japans air defense identification zone the area in which Tokyo controls aircraft movementThe launches coming as the G-20 meeting continued in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou and just days before North_Korea marks the 68th anniversary of the formation of its government constituted an armed protest an official from South_Koreas joint chiefs of staff said in a statementWe are fully prepared to fight tonight in case North_Korea makes any provocative moves the statement said according to the Yonhap_News Agency using the catchphrase of the American and South_Korean military alliesJapans Defense_Ministry added that the missiles landed between 120 and 160 miles west of Hokkaido the northernmost of Japans four main islandsAt the G-20 meeting South_Korean President Park_Geun-hye and Japanese_Prime Minister_Shinzo Abe met immediately and agreed to cooperate against North KoreaIn Washington State_Department spokesman John Kirby said the United_States strongly condemns the launchesThese launches which have become far too common in the past several months violate multiple UN_Security Council Resolutions explicitly prohibiting North_Koreas launches using ballistic_missile technology he said in a statement adding that US officials would raise the issue during the meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Laos on TuesdayOur commitment to the defense of our allies in the face of these threats remains ironclad Kirby saidMondays launches were just the latest salvo in a steady series of missiles coming from North_Korea Last month Kim_Jong Uns_regime claimed a great success in launching a ballistic_missile from a submarine about 300 miles toward Japan on top of making progress on its medium-range Musudan missile technology This is a particularly tense time in the region because of frictions over the Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defence (THAAD) anti-missile battery that the United_States will deploy to South_Korea part of their defense against North KoreaBeijing has protested strongly against the plan viewing it as part of an American effort to restrain a strengthening China and worrying that the system will home in on Chinas military activitiesThe issue has helped close the gap_between China and its erstwhile client state North_Korea after the provocations of a nuclear_test and long-range missile_launch earlier_this year Beijing and Pyongyang have traditionally been as close as lips and teeth as the saying goes but Xi_Jinping Chinas president has made his disdain for the young Kim clear Earlier in the day during a bilateral meeting at the G-20 with Xi Park said she hoped Seoul and Beijing would be able to unite together against North KoreaI hope that through earnest communication our two countries can turn this challenge into an opportunity to further strengthen and move_forward our bilateral relationship Park said during a bilateral meeting with Xi according to YonhapBut Xi reiterated his strong objections to Parks decision to accept the THAAD_battery onto South_Korean soilMishandling the issue is not conducive to strategic stability in the region and could intensify disputes Xi told Park according to a report from the Chinese state-run news_agency XinhuaNorth Korean leader_Kim Jong_Un boasted about the greatest success of a ballistic_missile launched from a submarine this week which appeared to be a major technological breakthrough for the nuclear-armed nationAfter a series of flops North_Korea launched a missile from a submarine near its east coast port of Sinpo early Wednesday It flew about 300 miles before falling into the sea inside_Japans air defense identification zone the area in which Tokyo controls aircraft movementThe launch apparently of a KN-11 or North Star missile contravenes UN resolutions and was roundly condemned by Japan South_Korea and China as well as by the United_States and the United NationsBut in North_Koreas state news media Thursday the apparently successful launch was cause for major celebration The Rodong Sinmun the newspaper of the ruling Korean Workers_Party carried seven color photos on its front page Thursday including a large one of Kim surrounded by military officials all of them smiling broadlySuch images are used in North_Korean propaganda in an effort to convince the populace who have little if any access to outside information that their impoverished and technologically backward country is strong and standing up to a United_States that the state media say is trying to destroy North_Korea Kim lauded the missile_launch as a great manifestation and demonstration of the tremendous power and inexhaustible muscle according to the state-run_Korean Central_News AgencyNorth Korea has joined the front rank of the military powers fully equipped with nuclear attack capability and the US mainland is now within North_Koreas striking range he saidThe missile was launched at a steep angle a South_Korean military source told Yonhap_News Agency in Seoul and probably could have traveled for more_than 600_miles if it had been fired at a regular angleThe launch coincided with the start of annual drills between the South_Korean and US militaries exercises that always elicit an angry reaction from the North which views them as a pretext for an invasion The young North_Korean leader came out with another_round of bluster ThursdayI do not guess what ridiculous remarks the US and its followers will make about this test-fire but I can say their rash acts will only precipitate their self-destruction Kim reportedly said The military has also clearly been trying to advance its ballistic_missile program conducting a series of land- and sea-based tests over the past_year It appears to be trying to work on its intermediate-range Musudan missile which can theoretically reach Guam and its submarine-launched missiles which would give it the ability to stage an attack from seaThe tests have had a patchy record of success The most recent KN-11 launches three in the past_year were all deemed failures because the missiles exploded at launch or traveled only a short distanceBut analysts say that even failures offer lessons for North_Koreas rocket scientistsJoseph S Bermudez a military analyst affiliated with the Washington-based US-Korea Institute at SAIS said this weeks test showed that North_Korea remains strongly committed to the long-term development of an operational submarine-launched_ballistic missile (SLBM) and is learning from its previous successes and failures Assuming the current rate of development while North_Korea still faces significant technological challenges including building a new class of submarine to carry the missile it is on track to develop the capability to strike targets in the region including Japan by 2020 Bermudez said in a commentary The latest launch was widely condemnedStphane Dujarric spokesman for UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said North_Koreas defiance of the international_community was deeply troubling The foreign ministers of Japan South_Korea and even China North_Koreas main ally said after a meeting in Tokyo that the launch was totally unacceptableNorth Korea launched four_missiles Monday morning a provocative barrage that coincided both with joint US-South Korean military_exercises on the southern half of the peninsula and with the opening of the annual National Peoples Congress in ChinaThe launches follow a remarkable month in which Kim_Jong Uns_regime tested a solid-fuel_rocket that it says is part of an_intercontinental ballistic_missile capable of hitting the United_States and in which the regime is accused of assassinating the leaders half_brother Both actions have angered allies and adversaries in the region and Mondays launches will only exacerbate thatEvery year this time they try to do something to defy the exercises said Bruce Bennett a North_Korea expert at the Rand_Corp in California This time I_think theyre also interested in making a statement to the Chinese and to let Beijing know this coal ban is going to hurt he said referring to Beijings decision last_month to stop importing coal from North_Korea cutting off a major economic lifelineThe four_missiles were fired from a known launch site on North_Koreas west coast not far from the border with China at 736 am local time They flew more_than 600_miles across the country before splashing into the sea between Japan and the Korean_Peninsula the Souths Joint_Chiefs of Staff said in a text message to local reportersThe joint chiefs initially suspected that at_least one of the projectiles might have been an_intercontinental ballistic_missile capable of hitting the United_States West Coast but later backed away from that analysis A US defense official said the Pentagon does_not think the missile was an ICBMThe US Strategic Command said its systems detected and tracked the projectile but determined the missile_launch from North_Korea did_not pose a threat to North America Regardless the launches have ratcheted up the tensions in the regionSouth Korea strongly condemns North_Koreas missile_launch today as a direct challenge and grave provocation despite warnings by the international_community Hwang Kyo-ahn the prime_minister who is acting president said during an emergency meeting of the national_security council North_Koreas nuclear missile provocation is a real and imminent threat against the lives and safety of South KoreansIn Japan the government said three of the missiles had landed perilously close splashing down within its exclusive_economic zone and within about 200 miles of its coastline in Akita prefectureThese missile_launches clearly show that North_Korea has developed a new threat a visibly worried Prime_Minister Shinzo_Abe told_reporters in Tokyo We will collect information and strongly protest to North KoreaBennett of Rand said the range of the missiles could have served as a warning to China The missiles had 12 of Chinas 20 largest cities within reach he saidChina expressed its dismay over the launch with a Foreign_Ministry spokeswoman saying it opposes launches that undermine UN resolutions Russia meanwhile was more blunt describing itself as seriously worried about the launches which raise tensions in the region North_Korea has repeatedly claimed to be working on an ICBM capable of reaching the west coast of the United_States and has been making observable progress toward this goal In his New Years address Kim said North_Korea had entered the final stage of preparation for a test-launch of an_intercontinental ballistic missileRegardless of whether Mondays launch was an ICBM it is just a matter of time until North_Korea succeeds in its goal of making one said Jeffrey_Lewis director of the East_Asia Non-Proliferation Program at the Middlebury_Institute of International_Studies at Monterey in CaliforniaIt doesnt matter if its today or tomorrow or next week or next year thats where this is heading Lewis said But we have no plan other than saying this is unacceptable or that it wont_happen he added referring to a tweet from President Trump earlier_this yearAfter Kims statement in a Jan 1 address that North_Korea was working on its ICBM program Trump tweeted It wont_happen His administration is reviewing its policy toward North_Korea which was characterized as strategic patience during the Obama_administration waiting for sanctions to hurt and a humbled Kim to come to the negotiating table The latest provocation came as large-scale military_exercises involving more_than 320000 South_Korean and US troops and high-tech US firepower continue in South_Korea They began last_week and will_continue through the end of AprilIn the past_year or two the with the two militaries practicing decapitation strikes on the North_Korean leadershipNorth Korea denounced the exercises and warned last_week that it was ready to retaliate North_Korea will never remain a passive onlooker to the new US administration overtly revealing its intention to put military pressure on [North Korea] and invade it while crying out for peace by dint of strength the state-run_Korean Central_News Agency reported in a statement it attributed to the Foreign MinistryNorth Korea last_month its first since Trump was elected president The missile appeared to show significant technological advances with upgraded power and range and analysts said it could mark another step in the push toward the capacity to hit Alaska or Washington stateAfter that Kims regime is suspected of ordering the assassination on the leaders half_brother Kim_Jong Nam who was attacked with a chemical weapon at the airport in Kuala_Lumpur Malaysia and died within 20 minutesThe assassination led the Trump administration to to go to New_York for meetings with former US officials involved in North_Korea policy which would have been the first time in more_than five_years that such a meeting had taken place on US soil Yoonjung_Seo in Seoul Yuki Oda in Tokyo and Missy Ryan in Washington contributed to this reportNorth Korea on Sunday declared that it had successfully put an earth observation satellite into_orbit under the direct orders of leader_Kim Jong_Un and said it planned to launch many moreBoth the South_Korean defense ministry and the launched at 9 am North_Korean time from a launch pad near the Chinese border appeared to have successfully reached spaceThe United_States Japan and South_Korea immediately condemned the launch a move widely seen as another step toward North_Korea mastering the technology for making a missile_capable of striking the mainland United_States The UN_Security Council called an emergency meeting for later Sunday to discuss how to respond to the countrys latest provocationBut North_Korea gloated about its most recent advance into space It said it that it had fired a Kwangmyongsong-4 (the name translates as lode star) a newer-model satellite than the one launched three years_ago and one that it said was equipped with devices for Earth measurement and communicationTodays success is a proud result of scientific achievement and an exercise of our legitimate right to space Ri Chun Hee North_Koreas most famous newsreader who was brought out of retirement to announce declared in a special broadcast from Pyongyang following the launchThe success of Kwangmyongsong-4 launch is a groundbreaking event The National Aerospace Development Administration plans to launch many more satellites following our national policy of focusing on the importance of science and technology she saidKim the 33-year-old third-generation leader of North_Korea personally signed the order to launch on Saturday Ri said The satellite entered orbit after nine minutes and 46 seconds she said in the broadcast on The launch took_place half an hour before the Republican presidential debate started and candidates Donald Trump and Sen Marco_Rubio (R-Fla) both urged China to get tough The rocket_launch was expected Pyongyang had to maritime and airspace authorities and analysts had detected movement at its launch site but coming just a month after a nuclear_test it nevertheless showed Kims continued willingness to defy the international communityThe rocket was projected to fly down South_Koreas west coast with the first stage expected to splash down near the southern island of Jeju while the second stage was forecast to go over the southern Japanese islands of Okinawa and in the sea east of the Philippines Television stations in Japan and South_Korea showed footage of the rocket flying through the skyThe rocket went missing from South_Korean military radar in the sea near Jeju Island at 936 am said defense ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun but the Japanese government said that it passed over the southern islands of Okinawa at about 941 am There were no reports of any debris falling on landWe can definitely say that this was an attempted space launch said Melissa Hanham a nuclear expert at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation StudiesNorth Korea previously fired a Kwangmyongsong-3 on an Unha-3 (galaxy) missile into_orbit in December 2012 the month that North_Korea marked the first anniversary of the death of Kim_Jong Il the current leaders father Kims regime had said it would launch the same kind of satellite into_orbit and the launch came a few hours after that window began Sundays launch also coincides with another key date North_Koreas celebration of Kim_Jong Ils birthday Feb 16North Korea has said the launches were of satellites intended for scientific purposes but analysts and many governments see this as a disguised missile_test North_Korea has successfully launched short- and medium-range missiles but has been working to develop a reliable long-range intercontinental_ballistic missile_capable of reaching the West Coast of the United StatesThis kind of rocket is designed as a space launch vehicle Before we can consider it an_intercontinental ballistic_missile there are a number of modifications that have to be made Hanham said A space rocket goes into the atmosphere to launch a satellite into_orbit but an_intercontinental ballistic_missile needs to return to Earth from the atmosphere to reach its target and deliver a warheadJim Walsh a research associate in the Security Studies Program at MIT said that even_though most of North_Koreas rocket and missile_tests had been failures and Pyongyang was still using liquid-launched rockets a technology now considered archaic everywhere else there was still reason for concernThis doesnt_mean that theyre not making progress The more tests they do the more they learn and theyre beavering away trying to improve their technology he said And it also means that at some level theyre still able to evade sanctionsNevertheless the international_community immediately resumed calls for North_Korea to face strong punishment for its actions through more sanctionsA spokesman for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called the launch deeply deplorable and exhorted North_Korea to halt its provocative actions and return to compliance with its international obligations Both South_Korean President Park_Geun-hye and Japanese_Prime Minister_Shinzo Abe called emergency meetings of their national_security councils during which both said they could not accept such a provocationFrom Washington Susan Rice President Obamas national_security adviser said that the launch using ballistic_missile technology following so closely after North_Koreas fourth_nuclear test represents yet_another destabilizing and provocative action and is a flagrant violation of multiple United_Nations Security_Council resolutionsNorth Koreas missile and nuclear_weapons programs represent serious threats to our interests including the security of some of our closest allies and undermine peace and security in the broader region she said in a statement Rice also reiterated calls mainly directed at China North_Koreas closest ally and a veto-wielding permanent member of the Security_Council for the international_community to stand together and demonstrate to North_Korea that its reckless actions must have serious consequencesBut China does_not seem particularly keen to crack down on its neighbor A immediately after the launch said Amid criticism and condemnation what should be borne in mind is that negotiations are the only viable solution to the predicament on the Korean_Peninsula as China has repeatedly pointed outA series of UN resolutions has prohibited North_Korea from carrying out nuclear or ballistic_missile tests but Kims regime has shown little regard for these orders Yoongjung Seo in Seoul and Yuki Oda in Tokyo contributed to this reportNorth Korea was practicing to strike United_States military bases in Japan with its state media in Pyongyang reported Tuesday and it appeared to be trying to outsmart a new American antimissile_battery being deployed to South_Korea by firing multiple rockets at onceKim Jong_Un presided over Mondays launch of the four_missiles feasting his eyes on the trails of ballistic rockets the state-run_Korean Central_News Agency reported in a statement that analysts called a brazen declaration of the countrys intent to strike enemies with a nuclear_weapon if it came under attackIf the United_States or South_Korea fires even a single flame inside North_Korean territory we will demolish the origin of the invasion and provocation with a nuclear tipped missile the KCNA statement saidThe four ballistic_missiles fired Monday morning were launched by the elite Hwasong ballistic_missile division tasked to strike the bases of the US imperialist aggressor forces in Japan KCNA said The United_States has numerous military bases and about 54000 military personnel stationed in Japan the legacy of its postwar security alliance with the countryThree of the four_missiles flew about 600_miles over North_Korea and landed in the sea within Japans_exclusive economic_zone off the Oga Peninsula in Akita prefecture home to a Japanese self-defense forces base The fourth fell just outside the zone North_Korea did_not say what kind of missiles it had fired but after poring over photos released by state media analysts at the Middlebury_Institute of International_Studies in California said they were extended-range Scuds capable of flying more_than 600 milesNorth Korea has tested these types of missiles before so the point of Mondays launches was not to see if the rockets would fly but to test how quickly the unit could set them up and deploy them classic training for a wartime situation said Jeffrey_Lewis director of the East_Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury InstituteThey want to know if they can get these missiles out into the field rapidly and deploy them all at once Lewis said They are practicing launching a nuclear-armed missile and hitting targets in Japan as if this was a real war North_Koreas extended-range Scud is halfway between a traditional short-range Scud and the medium-range missile known as the Rodong But they can be produced much more cheaply than the Rodong Lewis said meaning that North_Korea could fire them with more abandonKCNA reported that the four_missiles were launched simultaneously and that Kim commented that they are so accurate that they look like acrobatic flying corps in formationThis appeared to be a further challenge to the United_States and South_Korea which said Tuesday that it had started deploying the advanced antimissile_battery called Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defense or THAAD designed to protect the region against North_Koreas rockets The first parts of the THAAD_system arrived Monday at Osan Air Base south of Seoul South_Koreas Defense_Ministry saidBut THAAD would have difficulty intercepting four_missiles launched at the same_time analysts saidFurthermore Osan Air Base is less_than 300 miles from the missile_launch site in North_Korea another apparent message to Pyongyangs enemiesThe launches coincided with joint US-South Korean military_exercises on the southern half of the Korean_Peninsula drills that take_place every year and that North_Korea views as preparation for an invasion After the missiles were launched Monday the US Strategic Command said it had determined that the missile_launch did_not pose a threat to North AmericaBut KCNA reported that the 33-year-old Kim had ordered the strategic forces to be on high alert as required by the grim situation in which an actual war may break out anytime and get fully ready to promptly moveNorth Korea has been making clear progress on its missile program and has a declared goal of developing an_intercontinental ballistic_missile capable of reaching the West Coast of the United_States It has also conducted five nuclear_tests and claims to be able to miniaturize a warhead so that it could be fitted onto a missileHowever it has not yet proven the ability to either attach a warhead to a missile or to be able to deliver a missile to a target something that would involve mastering the difficult step of reentry The launches also appeared designed to send a message to both President Trump and the Japanese prime_minister Shinzo_Abe said Joshua Pollack editor of the Nonproliferation ReviewWe might infer that the choice of Japan as a target might be based on a desire to do something new compared to last_year raising the stakes of the exercises but also on Abes visit to the US and joint appearances with Trump Pollack saidNorth Korea launched a medium-range missile last_month its first since Trump was elected while the president was hosting Abe for dinner at his Mar-a-Lago_Club in FloridaTrump spoke by phone with Abe and South_Koreas acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn Tuesday morningBoth Japan and the US confirmed that this North_Korean missile_launch was a clear violation of UN_Security Council_resolutions and was an obvious challenge to the region and the international_community Abe told_reporters in Tokyo repeating his assertion that the North_Korean threat had reached a new stageIn New_York a spokesman for UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres said he condemned the actions which violate Security_Council resolutions and seriously undermine regional peace and stabilityPyongyang cant stop shooting (a) missiles into the sea and (b) itself in the footAt 736 am Monday local time North_Korea launched four_missiles that flew about 600_miles over land before splashing into the Sea of Japan As my colleague Anna Fifield three landed within Japans_exclusive economic_zone dropping about 200 miles from the coastThe test was timed to provoke It came not a month after North_Korea tested a solid-fuel_rocket that it claims is part of an_intercontinental ballistic_missile capable of hitting the United_States and three weeks after the in Malaysia of ruler Kim_Jong Uns_half brother Kim_Jong Nam who had been under Chinese protectionIt also coincided withjoint US-South Korean military_exercises on the southern half of the Korean_Peninsula and to Beijings certain dismay the opening of Chinas National Peoples Congress the Communist Partys tightly scripted not-to-be-interrupted-or-overshadowed political spectacleIndeed although North_Korea has been getting on a lot of nerves lately it may be China that is most acutely frustrated And since China is North_Koreas only real ally that could hurt Kim_Jong UnChina and North_Korea used to be tight Mao Zedong once said the neighbors were as close as lips and teethBut in recent_years China has grown frustrated with the Norths potentially destabilizing economic woes as well as a nuclear_program that from Beijings perspective keeps the US military at the gateAlthough critics have long accused Beijing of propping up the Kim regime the Chinese side responded to last months rocket test and assassination with what appeared to be a real piece of economic punishment Beijing coal imports a financial lifeline for North_Korea until the end of 2017Mondays test will only deepen Beijings displeasure China is in the midst of a major campaign against US plans to deploy the (THAAD)_system to South_Korea THAAD is a land-based missile_defense system that would be operated by US troops stationed in South_Korea Seoul and Washington argue it is a necessary defense against North KoreaBut China hates the plan To Beijing THAAD is a security threat designed to undermine the Chinese military a strategic plot hatched by the Americans In recent_weeks China has stepped up public criticism of the project and moved to punish South_Korea for forging ahead with the plan>Chinas party-controlled press is already about destroying or blinding the THAAD_system To express its displeasure with South_Korea China has also to pop stars and pulled wildly popular South_Korean television dramas off the air Lets see how far South_Korean TV dramas and stars can go without strong support from the Chinese market read one editorial in the Global_Times a newspaper known for its nationalist toneThe THAAD installation is a mighty blow against strategic mutual trust between Beijing and Seoul the paper continued Ties will inevitably hit rock bottom and this will be a loss for both_sides In the long-run China needs to get ready to confront SeoulThe US and South_Korea are not dealing with the THAAD issue very well because they have not fully considered Chinas security concernssaidCui Zhiying director of the Korean_Peninsula Research Center at Shanghais Tongji University All parties should cooperate on this issue instead of the US and South_Korea getting together to suppress ChinaAnd thats just it China never liked North_Koreas missile_tests but right_now they are particularly inconvenient Interrupting Chinas National Peoples Congress with yet_another missile_test makes it harder for Beijing to rail against South_Koreas plans because it makes THAADs stated purpose shooting down North_Korean missiles seem legitChina on Monday expressed wary dismay at the latest development with a spokesman for the Foreign_Ministry saying Beijing opposes launches that undermine United_Nations Security_Council resolutions Behind closed doors Chinese cadres will no_doubt have more to say to their erstwhile friendsKeeping up its drumbeat of colorfully worded threats North_Korea warned Wednesday that it may launch an ultra-precision strike to scorch the South_Korean presidents officeTensions are running high on the Korean_Peninsula as the United_States and South_Korea conduct and mounting against Pyongyang start to biteIncensed at both efforts North_Koreas propaganda machine has been outdoing itself with ever-more inventive and florid statementsIn its latest missive the Norths organization in charge of relations with the South declared that Pyongyangs forces were prepared to annihilat[e] the enemy without mercyWe do not hide the fact that it may start inside the Cheong wa Dae or near it the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said in a statement carried Wednesday by the Norths Korean_Central News_Agency using the Korean term for South_Koreas presidential Blue_House President Park_Geun-hye lives and works thereAll the dens of the enemy in South_Korea including the Cheong wa Dae are the primary targets of the ultra-precision strike means it said Powerful large-caliber multiple-rocket-launching systems are at the ready to scorch the Cheong wa Dae bossed by Park_Geun-hye in a jiffy North_Koreas state media have recently been running footage of Kim_Jong Un the states leader overseeing launches from what it calls a Korean-style large-caliber multiple-launch rocket system Some of the projectiles appear to have been launched from a mobile system akin to the one Pyongyang has describedOnce their buttons are pushed [Cheong wa Dae] is bound to be reduced to a sea in flames and ashes the committee said in the reportTensions between the two Koreas divided since the end of World WarII have been running particularly high in recent months after Kim in January ordered the and then oversaw what is thought to have been the launch of a Park who had been pursuing a trustpolitik approach of using carrots and sticks on North_Korea has this year abandoned any attempt at engaging the Pyongyang regime and has instead taken a surprisingly tough approach She that had generated hundreds of millions of dollars for the North and imposed tough new sanctions on the regimeNorth Koreas response has been typically shrill but also with the regime calling the Souths first female president a capricious whore among various choice labelsPark vowed Wednesday to continue exerting pressure on North_Korea over its nuclear and missile programsWe will create the conditions in which North_Korea cannot survive unless it changes she said in a speech at a hotel in Seoul according to the Yonhap_News AgencyNorth Korea has a habit of making threats on which it cannot practically follow through Nevertheless the annual joint military_exercises in the South and the increased military activities in the North have ensured that tensions are running higher than usualThe diplomats decision to defect from a regime he had spent his whole life defending did_not happen overnightInstead his misgivings had been simmering for two_decades even as he went around Europe espousing the superiority of the North_Korean system They finally reached a boiling point when Thae Yong-ho realized that this regime to which he had been so loyal expected him to lie to his childrenIve known that there was no future for North_Korea for a long time Thae told The Washington_Post in his first interview with the foreign media since his escape from the North_Korean Embassy in London where he served as deputy ambassadorBut last_summer he realized his hopes had been misplaced that supreme leader who was educated in Switzerland and is only 33 would turn out to be a reformer Thae fled together with his wife and his two sons now ages 19 and 26Kim Jong_Un is still young Thae said I was afraid that even my grandsons would have to live under this system I decided that if I didnt cut the chains of slavery off [my sons] they would complain Why didnt you let us be freeThae is the highest ranking diplomat to defect from North_Korea After several months being debriefed by the South_Korean intelligence service he was in Seoul speaking out against the regimes reign of terror Over the past month Thae has predicted to South_Korean media the demise of North_Korea with the same fervor with which he once extolled its glories His hard-line statements happen to fit nicely with the hawkish stance taken by the South_Korean government over the past eight years But Thae said he was not being expedient and was speaking his real mind and was intent on using his influence for goodEveryone knows about my defection Just staying at home or living a quiet life would not effect any change in North_Korea Thae a genial 54-year-old who speaks impeccable English said during an_interview in a hotel hereSouth Korean authorities are concerned about Thaes safety and the possibility of an attempt on his life North_Korea released a tirade against him after his defection calling him human scum and a criminal and has made attempts once successfully on the lives of other high-profile defectors Thae was accompanied by an entourage of bodyguards and intelligence officials to the interviewHe spent more_than two hours describing his disappointment with Kim his fears for his children and his conviction that giving North_Koreans information about the outside_world would help sow the seeds of dissent just as it had for him and his familyThe regime can only stay in place by preventing outside information he said People there are not educated about the outside_world and have no opportunity to experience freedom or a system that is differentIn North_Korea the Internet is banned for all but a handful of elites radios and televisions play only state propaganda and the newspapers are full of the leaders great feats South_Korean dramas are increasingly being smuggled into North_Korea but people watch them in secret fearing severe punishment if they are caughtThae said that anything to break the information blockade in North_Korea should be encouraged from USB drives containing foreign films to radios that can be tuned to news broadcasts from abroadI would like to make it possible for people to rise up he said We should educate the North_Korean people so that they can have their own Korean SpringThaes grandfather and father were devoted to the Kim dynasty and Thae grew up knowing only North_Koreas peculiar brand of communist personality cult Then in the 1990s as a relatively young diplomat he was posted to Denmark where his younger son was born and after that to SwedenIn Scandinavia home to the flagbearers of European socialism Thaes eyes began to openDuring my first foreign posting in Denmark I came to doubt and question whether North_Korea could say that it was a true socialist or communist system he said Thaes time there coincided with a devastating famine in North_Korea that killed as many as 3 million peopleNorth Korean society doesnt have the concept of comparing he said The more time you spend in the outside_world the disbelief in your system grows more and moreThae then did two stints in the embassy in London first between 2004 and 2008 then from 2013 until his defection last_summer It was during this second stint in London in the second year of Kim_Jong Uns_regime that Thaes concerns started to become unbearableNot only me but other North_Korean elites were hopeful that because Kim_Jong Un had studied abroad and was young he might change the policy direction and modernize North_Korea he saidBut Kim soon showed his intention to continue his fathers pursuit of nuclear_weapons and his reluctance to introduce the economic reforms the impoverished country badly needsKim Jong_Un made it very clear that North_Korea should complete the path toward nuclear development Thae said This kind of policy is regarded by most North_Korean elites like me as very fanatical because it pushes North_Korea into a corner of self-destruction The doubts heightened after Kim had his uncle executed at the end of 2013 Although executions are not rare in North_Korea there was something disturbingly arbitrary about this one Thae saidStill he continued his duties in London with free housing health_care and educationBut at home Thaes younger son who was still in high_school and hoped to study computer science at a top London university was asking why North_Korea doesnt allow the Internet why North_Koreans are not allowed to watch foreign films why North_Koreans cant read any books they wantAs a father it was hard for me to tell lies and it started a debate within the family Thae said This North_Korean system is a really inhuman system It even abuses the love between parents and their childrenSo last July after much preparation and as the end of his posting was approaching Thae escaped with his wife and both their sonsThae declined to discuss the specifics of how his family fled saying that giving away details could close off the escape route for other North_Korean officials abroadHis arrival in South_Korea was the most high profile of what is said to be a string of elite defections Last year the government in Seoul hinted that there had been numerous defections from the military and diplomatic service as well as among officials charged with raising money for Kim himselfThe South_Korean government and some analysts have portrayed the defections as signs of cracks in Kims regime which has endured despite repeated predictions of its imminent collapse A former intelligence official told The_Post that about 100 elite defectors have been debriefed at a secret residential center run by the governmentThere is no sense of solidarity or loyalty between Kim_Jong Un and senior officials Thae said Senior officials know that this system cant continueStill Thae described feeling shame about his previous role saying he was an actor who pretended to love the systemNow he is trying to fix that Ive decided to spend the rest of my_life meaningfully and I want to do something significant not just for my family but also my countryKim Jong_Nam the half_brother of the North_Korean leader died a very painful death within 20 minutes of having poison smeared on his face Malaysian authorities said SundayThis suggests he was exposed to an overwhelming amount of VX a nerve agent that is classified as a weapon of mass destruction S Subramaniam Malaysias health minister saidThe absorption level was so rapid that within a few minutes the guy had symptoms Subramaniam told_reporters in Kuala_Lumpur Malaysias capital From the time of the onset he died within 15 to 20 minutesKim Jong_Nam the estranged older brother of North_Korean leader_Kim Jong_Un was attacked in the busy Kuala_Lumpur airport on Feb 13 by two women who wiped a substance on his face and in his eyes They fled while their victim sought help but he died in an ambulance on the way to the hospitalMalaysian police said Friday that the autopsy showed Kim_Jong Nam died of exposure to VX a chemical weapon that can be absorbed through the skin or mucous membranes All suspicions about the attack rest with the regime in Pyongyang Malaysia has implicated eight North_Koreans including a diplomat said to be hiding in the North_Korean Embassy in Kuala_Lumpur and a scientist whom Malaysia has in custodySouth Korea has bluntly blamed the assassination on Kim_Jong Un accusing him of trying to eliminate potential rivals to his power while the for North_Korean diplomats who were to arrive in New_York this week for talks with former US officials The decision was made after Malaysia announced the finding of VXVX is banned under the international but North_Korea is not a signatory Pyongyang is thought to have the worlds third-largest stocks of chemical_weapons behind the United_States and Russia and is believed to have been pursuing VX according to the VX is a nerve agent that interferes with the workings of the major organs including the lungs leading to death by muscle paralysisThe muscle goes into a state of permanent contraction Subramaniam said The dose that the 45-year-old victim received was so high that his heart and lungs would have been affected quickly he said After the autopsy results and 11_days after the attack teams in hazmat suits swept the airport terminal for traces of VX or other toxins but found none and declared the terminal safeMembers of the medical staff who helped Kim are being monitored but none has shown symptoms Subramaniam saidQuestions are being raised about how the two women who carried_out the attack apparently without wearing gloves managed to survive Security camera footage shows them going to the bathroom immediately after the attack presumably to wash their handsSiti Aishah who is Indonesian and was reportedly the first to apply the oil-like substance to Kim_Jong Nam told police she vomited in a taxi after leaving the airport and continued to feel unwell She is being testedAishah has repeatedly told police that she was tricked into carrying out the attack she says she was told that it was a prank and was paid about $100 for taking part However the security footage shows the women acting with determination and immediately rushing off after the attack Malaysian authorities say that no one from Kim_Jong Nams family has come forward to claim his body They have been asking for a DNA match before releasing the body and there were reports last_week that his 22-year-old son had arrived from Macau but these turned_out to be falseNorth Korea has angrily denounced every part of the investigation accusing the South_Korean government of persuading Malaysia to besmirch Pyongyangs reputation by laying the blame on itNorth Koreas ambassador in Kuala_Lumpur strongly objected to an autopsy being carried_out at all saying that the victim whom he did_not identify was carrying a diplomatic passport and was therefore not subject to Malaysian lawsMalaysia has however insisted that it will follow all usual procedures for investigating a suspicious deathNorth Korea shot a ballistic_missile startlingly close to Japan on Wednesday sparking stern condemnations from Tokyo Seoul and WashingtonThe medium-range Rodong missile splashed down about 150 miles off the countrys northwest coast Japans Defense_Ministry said suggesting it could have landed inside_Japans exclusive_economic zone Wednesdays actions were the latest apparent protest from North_Korea over a decision by Seoul and Washington to bring an antimissile_battery system to South KoreaNorth Korea has never sent a missile into Japans_exclusive economic_zone on the Sea of Japan side of the island chain although in 1998 North_Korea fired a Taepodong-1 missile ostensibly launching a satellite over Japan and into its economic_zone on the Pacific Ocean sideMap coordinates showed the missile landing about 160 miles from the Japanese coast within Japans 200-mile EEZ This would put it within a minute of reaching Japan itself said Euan Graham who served as a British diplomat in Pyongyang North_Koreas capital Its a clear case of walking right up to the line and just putting a nose over it said Graham now an East Asian security expert at the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney Its a provocative actSouth Koreas Joint_Chiefs of Staff and the US Strategic Command said they detected two simultaneous launches of Rodong intermediate-range ballistic_missiles from the North_Korean launch site in the southwest of the country shortly_before 8 am local time WednesdayOne appeared to explode shortly_after launch they saidBut the other appeared to fly over the peninsula and some 12minutes later to land 620 miles away in the waters off the Akita prefecture The Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defense_(THAAD) system aimed_at intercepting North_Korean missiles is set to be deployed near the rural area of Seongju South_Korea some 200 miles southeast of Seoul by the end of next year The plan is controversial among residents in the area many of whom fear they will become a target for North KoreaPyongyang has called the THAAD_battery vicious warmongering and has threatened a nuclear strike against the siteMeanwhile China views the deployment as a thinly disguised attempt to keep it in check Beijing seized on Wednesdays launch as further proof that the United_States plan to deploy the system was causing instability in the regionSouth Korea is putting the cart before the horse in their pursuit of national_security as the key to security lies in good neighborly and friendly relations with its neighbors rather_than a bunch of US-made missiles the Chinese state-run news_agency South_Korean military officials told_reporters in Seoul that Wednesdays launches the latest in a volley of missiles North_Korea has fired in recent months suggested Pyongyang was trying to show off its ability to target and perhaps even hit nearby countries it deemed hostileAfter the launch of shorter-range Scud missiles last_month North_Korean state media ran footage showing Kim_Jong Un sitting in front of maps that right down to the southern port city of Busan within rangeWith Wednesdays launches Pyongyang was signaling to Tokyo that it also had the capacity to strike Japan Graham noted And although North_Korea relies on the support of China the latest act will probably set alarm bells ringing in Beijing because it means the Chinese capital is also in rangeKims regime would almost certainly never hurl missiles toward China but its ability to do so could increase Beijings rationale for developing its own missile_defense system Graham said Fears about North_Koreas technical abilities have been mounting While some of North_Koreas recent missile_launches especially of the Musudan-type missile appear to have been failures analysts say that the Norths scientists are honing their technology with every testThe progress North_Korea is making might embolden the regime and encourage it to take even more incendiary action Tokyo said in its annual defense white paper released Tuesday North_Korea appeared to be making progress in its aim to make nuclear_warheads capable of being carried to the mainland United_States it saidAmong US allies there was sharp condemnation Wednesday of North_Koreas latest defiance of The launch was an unforgivable act of aggression that represents a grave threat to the security of Japan said Prime_Minister Shinzo_Abe A spokesman for South_Koreas Unification Ministry called the missile_launch a serious provocation to South_Korea and the international communityThe Pentagon urged North_Korea to refrain from ratcheting up tensions in the region It should focus instead on taking concrete steps toward fulfilling its commitments and international obligations said Gary Ross a US Navy commanderBut analysts expect North_Korea to continue with missile_launches and other provocations over the next few_weeks as South_Korea and the

North_Korean representatives to the United_States for talks with former American officials the first such meeting in more_than five_years and a sign that Pyongyang sees a potential opening with the Trump administrationArranging the talks has become a lot more complicated over the past eight days with North_Korea and the assassination of Kim_Jong Uns_half brother in Malaysia an act that many suspect was Malaysian police on Sunday named as suspects four North_Koreans who left the country on the day of the attackAnalysts also say they highly doubt that Pyongyang which has insisted on being recognized as a nuclear state would be willing to moderate its position on its weapons programIf the talks do take_place they could offer a glimmer of hope for an already-hostile relationship that has only deteriorated as the Kim government works aggressively to develop a nuclear-tipped missile_capable of reaching the continental United StatesThe planning for the Track 15 talks with the US side made up of the former officials who usually take part in Track 2 talks but the North_Korean side composed of government officials is still in a preparatory stage according to people with knowledge of the arrangementsThe State_Department has not approved the North_Koreans visas for the talks which would take_place in New_York within the next few weeksThe North_Koreans have expressed an interest in engagement but nothings been approved yet said one person_familiar with the preparations speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss them Others who have been in touch with North_Koreans describe an intense interest in what President Trump might doIf this happens it would be an interesting signal to the new administration one person said of the discussions The talks would be the clearest indication yet that Kim wants to talk with the Trump administration If this happens I would take it as a very positive sign from both_sides said another person with knowledge of the arrangementsIn recent_years there have been sporadic Track 15 talks that have taken place in Kuala_Lumpur Geneva Berlin and Ulaanbaatar Mongolia But these talks have not taken place in the United_States since July 2011 before Kim succeeded his father in North KoreaThe planned talks are being organized by Donald S Zagoria of the National_Committee on American Foreign Policy who served as a consultant on Asia during the Carter administration and has organized previous rounds of such talks Zagoria declined to comment on the preparationsThe talks would be run independently of the State_Department where officials have privately questioned the utility of such discussions But if the administration issued the visas it would be an implicit seal of approval And if the discussions go well they could pave the way for official talks Choe Son Hui the director of the US affairs department in North_Koreas Foreign_Ministry is likely to lead the delegation from PyongyangShe is well known to American officials having participated in official meetings including the six-party talks on denuclearization as well as in other Track15 talksChoe has a direct line to Kim according to Thae Yong Ho the North_Korean deputy ambassador to London who defected to South_Korea last_year Since Trump was elected there has been a notable change in North_Koreas usually bombastic rhetoricPyongyang had been sharply critical of the Obama_administration saying its policy of strategic patience waiting for North_Korea to change its nuclear calculations was an aggressive and heinous strategic suffocation policy against North KoreaBut in its announcement of its missile_launch Feb 12 the Norths state media did_not include its usual bluster about needing a deterrent against the United_States and its hostile policiesIn his own statement after the launch Trump notably did_not condemn Pyongyang The new president has in fact said very little about how he plans to deal with North_Korea North_Korea well take care of it folks were going to take care of it all he said at his last_week without elaboratingHis administration is conducting a review of North_Korea policy This provides space to broaden the options for dealing with Pyongyang and an opportunity to influence the new president analysts sayWhile some expect him to take a hard-line approach encouraged by hawkish advisers others say that Trump who prides himself on making deals could be open to dialogue with the North_Korean regimeUS policy is hanging in the balance said Adam Cathcart an expert on North_Korea at the University of Leeds in BritainI think the North_Koreans ought to be pretty happy because the Americans have laid off criticizing them too_much and have in fact been making things quite easy for them Cathcart said But at some point they are going to have to decide whether to pick up the cudgel For those favoring an even tougher approach to North_Korea recent events have provided plenty of ammunitionOn Feb 12 North_Korea tested a ballistic_missile for the first time since Trump was elected The missile appeared to show significant technological advances with upgraded power and range and could mark another step in the push toward the capacity to hit Alaska or Washington stateThen on Feb 13 the estranged half_brother of the North_Korean leader was attacked and apparently poisoned at Kuala_Lumpur International Airport He died shortly afterwardAlthough the investigation is ongoing the South_Korean government has blamed the assassination on Kim_Jong Un who has eliminated potential rivals to his power over the past four yearsMalaysian police have arrested one North_Korean man in connection with the attack and on Sunday named four other North_Koreans suspected of being involvedThe four had been in Malaysia for several weeks but all left on the day of the attack said Noor Rashid Ibrahim Malaysias deputy national police chief on Sunday at a news conferenceComplicating the environment further the South_Korean and US militaries are due to start annual joint exercises next month an event that always elicits an angry response from Pyongyang which sees the drills as a pretext for an invasionIn the past_year or two the with the two militaries practicing decapitation strikes on the North_Korean leadershipAs ordinary North_Koreans have found ways to get information the state denies them soppy South_Korean dramas and peppy pop songs novels news from the outside_world so too has the Kim regime found news ways to crack down on them according to a new report released WednesdayThe regime has developed sophisticated new tools to check just what its citizens are up to according to Compromising Connectivity a new report from The report underlines the challenges in getting information into the most tightly controlled country on the planet and the challenges that North_Korea watchers as diverse as the US Congress and small defector-led groups face in trying to penetrate itIn a lot of ways the expansion of information is continuing said Nat Kretchun the lead author of the report which draws on interviews with 34 recent defectors from North_Korea Its just that we also see a lot of signs that the North_Korean government is gearing up to combat itKim Jong_Un his father and his grandfather have kept a tight grip on the North_Korean populace for more_than seven decades by denying citizens access to information State television radio and newspapers laud the work of the Kim family telling North_Koreans how lucky they are to live in such a strong and happy countryBut thanks to dramas smuggled in on USB sticks and illicit shortwave radio broadcasts from the outside an increasing number of North_Koreans have realized that their brethren in the South enjoy unimaginable levels of wealth and freedom Being caught with such banned media can result in harsh penalties including imprisonmentAt the same_time the introduction of cellphones albeit for domestic calls only and without Internet access is allowing people around the country to share information much more freely internally High-profile defectors such as who served as a North_Korean diplomat in Europe for almost 20 years have described the transformative effect of outside information and have urged governments and NGOs to flood North_Korea with itWhile imposing new sanctions on North_Korea last_year Congress allocated $50million over the next five_years for radio programming and the promotion of freedom of information inside North KoreaBut the real picture is more complicated the Intermedia report saysTheyre clearly trying to innovate their way out of the breakdown of the security apparatus rather_than going back to Kim_Il Sung times Kretchun said referring to the founding president of the totalitarian state North_Koreas security apparatus began crumbling in the 1990s after a devastating famine that gave the regime no choice but to tolerate markets which then became a venue for sharing informationThey now have a vision of a more sophisticated but no less controlled media environment he saidTake cellphones North_Koreans are now allowed such devices including a re-branded Chinese Android-based smartphone called ArirangAs recently as 2013 North_Koreans could use these to share files including songs and text through Bluetooth or micro-storage SD cards But a mandatory software update rolled out in 2013 included a program called TraceViewer that would collect browsing history and take periodic screenshots of activity which the user could not delete That means the security services can see exactly what the user has been up to long after they have removed any SD card The update also included a signature system that would prevent a device from opening any files that dont bear a North_Korean state signature and in fact automatically deletes themEven with the network restrictions that were applied at the beginning cellphones could have been a game-changing device in North_Korea Kretchun said But the system update stops that from happeningNorth Korea has a unique advantage in that it can dictate what devices their people have he said He added that the state has made it very difficult for citizens to undermine their technology They put a lot of work into making sure you have to be quite technologically sophisticated to do the equivalent of jailbreaking these phonesAccess to outside networks has also been curtailed Residents on the border with China have been able to get signals on Chinese phones but the regime appears to have cracked down on this using jammers and signal detectorsOnce I went into a house and made a call to China and inspectors came within 30 seconds said a 59-year-old man who used to work for a trading company near the Chinese city of Dandong There are inspectors going around with an eavesdropping device to control calls to China he told the reports authors But North_Koreans are still able to watch movies and dramas at home relatively easilyPreviously they watched foreign movies and soap operas on DVDs smuggled into the country but in recent_years they have developed a preference for USB sticks and SD cards which are easier to hide They plug the USBs or SD cards into their DVD players which are permitted although only to watch North_Korean propaganda and make_sure to have a DVD in the drive in case of a spot inspectionSmall portable DVD players called notels also are used for watching foreign dramasUsing small storage devices not only allows North_Koreans to hide them easily during raids but also enables them to share media with each_other All but one of the North_Korean defectors Intermedia interviewed said they had shared content with othersDespite the challenges Kretchun said there was reason to keep trying to penetrate the North_Korean regimes information blockade Right now all the arrows continue to point up People are still certainly watching foreign dramas and listening to the radio he saidSometimes the men just wanted to talk with the North_Korean women Face cam its called But most of the time they wanted the other option body cam Watching through a smartphone app the men would ask the women some of the unknown thousands of North_Koreans sold to Chinese husbands and living secretly in northern China to show their breasts or their backsides to touch themselves or perform sex acts on one anotherMost of the time the women did as requested They needed the money even if it amounted to only a few dollars a dayIn the beginning I didnt think it was going to be a big deal I thought it would be okay because I wasnt actually sleeping with anyone said Suh who until dreams of escape brought her to this dingy room in Laos had been one of the legions of North_Korean women performing online sex work in back rooms in China But then I found out how many perverts there are out thereSuh a 30-year-old who escaped from North_Korea in 2008 resorted to doing video chatting after her second child was born and her husbands meager construction earnings wouldnt stretch any furtherThere are some people who just want to look at your face but the majority of them are there for their sexual desires Suh said putting her head down so her long hair covered her cherubic face I felt so disgustingTogether with two women from her village in northeastern China who were also doing chatting work Suh fled over the summer She made the heart-wrenching decision to leave her 5-year-old daughter with her Chinese husbandThe women traveled by bus and car down through China to the border with Laos which they crossed illegally in the black of night Suh carrying her 18-month-old daughter Ji-yeon on her backThe women made it to Vientiane the Laotian capital where a Washington_Post reporter spent two days with them as they paused on their journey to what they hoped would be a better life The women talked for hours about their lives in North_Korea and in China but unlike some defectors who exaggerate their stories to make them more sensational they appeared to play down their experiences apparently out of shame Most of their stories could be verified with the pastor and broker who were helping them escape and The women had a friend film them at work before they left so they could prove what they had been doing The videos showed the women sometimes in brightly colored underwear sometimes naked sitting against a low bed covered with a purple Hello Kitty quilt in front of two computers on a low table Men sometimes visible sometimes not gave them instructions Most of the men they chatted with online were in South_Korea but a few were in America and even AfricaSafely out of China the other two women both called Kim wanted to get to South_Korea but Suh had her heart set on a more ambitious destination the United_States the strongest country on EarthI think my daughter is one lucky baby Suh said sitting on the bed in a grimy room in Vientiane and looking at Ji-yeon as she slept snoring lightly Their few possessions were in plastic shopping bags save for the clothes drying on coat hangers dangling from the light fittings The baby had not even one toy All the suffering is worth it Our destiny has changed Suh saidDefections such as that of who fled to South_Korea over the summer make headlines because they are so rare But less sensationally a steady if diminishing stream of North_Koreans is making their way out down through China across to Laos then into Thailand and eventually to South KoreaMost are women from the northern provinces considered down-and-out even by North_Korean standards and face an extremely precarious life in northeastern China Many had been sold some knowingly thinking life couldnt get any worse But other women had been tricked into thinking they were heading to jobs in China only to find that the man who offered to help them escape paying bribes to border soldiers and arranging passage turned_out to be a trafficker selling the women and pocketing the profitsThe buyers are men in the countryside who are too poor or unappealing to get a wife any other way and the women are stuck in remote villages where they cannot communicate with the locals if they are permitted to leave the house that isSince Kim_Jong Un took control of North_Korea at the end of 2011 security has been tightened and it has become increasingly difficult to escape That has driven up prices Women ages 15 to 25 are the most prized fetching between $10000 and $12000 brokers and humanitarian workers say while women in their 30s can be acquired for half thatIncreased prices mean that some Chinese families are spending their entire life savings to buy a North_Korean woman and as a result the women are sometimes shackled inside the houseBut even if the women are allowed out and even after they learn some Chinese venturing into the open is a risky business If theyre caught by the Chinese police they face repatriation to North_Korea and at a minimum time in a labor campThese North_Korean women in China faced a dire dilemma either having to remain hidden and submit to this kind of sexual exploitation or risk working outside of their residence with the very real possibility that Chinese authorities could arrest them at any time and force them back to North_Korea said Phil Robertson of Human Rights WatchThe State Departments noted that North_Korean women and girls are subjected to sexual slavery by Chinese or Korean-Chinese men forced prostitution in brothels or through Internet sex sites or compelled service as hostesses in nightclubs or karaoke barsThe State_Department reported that the Chinese government does_not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking however it is making significant efforts to do soAlthough some women take the risk of working outside the home or working behind the scenes in restaurants an increasing number feel they have no choice but to try to make money behind closed doorsThat is where video chatting comes in About one-fifth of the North_Korean women living in hiding in China are involved in this kind of online sex work said Park a broker who works to get women outThe Post agreed to withhold Parks full name to avoid jeopardizing this highly sensitive work The newspaper also agreed to use the womens family names only partly to protect relatives in North KoreaIf youre working in a restaurant or outside you run the risk of being asked for your papers by the police So doing this work is safer and the money is better Park said In the village where they lived every North_Korean woman does this Its so normal to be doing thisSome North_Korean women in China are forced into this work essentially held prisoner by pimps The women The_Post met were not forced as such But they had few other opportunitiesSuh was sold eight years_ago to a man in northern China who she said treated her well he beat her only a few times But the arrival of their second child made a tough financial situation untenable She heard about video chatting through a friend of a friend and began chatting with South_Korean men at night when everyone in her house was asleepOn her first day she earned $3 In her best week she netted $120A few months_ago Suh decided she couldnt take it I wondered why I had to do this Im a human being the same as everyone else Suh said breaking down into heaving sobs I wanted to be a good mother a strong mother for my daughters She decided to try to leave along with the two others They found out about Park and Kim Sung-eun a pastor from the Caleb Mission a church in South_Korea that helps bring defectors to safety and asked to be helped out For the second time in their lives they escaped this time to a safe house in northern China and from there they made the journey to the border then walked to LaosI was so scared but I kept on going I just kept on going Suh said I kept walking toward Pastor Kim and ParkLaos was safer but still somewhat of a gray area they may be sent back Once they got to Thailand the fear of repatriation to North_Korea would be goneWhile waiting to cross the Mekong River the women talked about the difficult decisions they had had to make Suhs 5-year-old is listed on her Chinese fathers family register which gives her legal status in China and enables her to go to school But by the time Ji-yeon was born the back channel for registration involving bribes to willing officials had closed The baby doesnt legally existSo when Suh decided to flee and realized she could only manage to take one child with her she knew it had to be Ji-yeon She thinks Ive abandoned her Suh said breaking down into another torrent of tears as she recalled telling her older daughter she would be back soonThe day they were to cross into Thailand the women were full of nervous excitement But things soon went wrong Heavy rain had swollen the Mekong and their boat missed the drop pointThey were discovered by local police and taken to a prison They were terrified and sent an endless stream of messages to Park asking if they would be sent back to North_Korea One photo they sent showed Ji-yeon standing in a cell looking out through the bars Instead they were taken to Bangkok where they are now being held at a detention center the pastor saidSuh has applied for asylum in the United_States even_though she speaks no English and knows she will receive little support unlike in South_Korea Officials from the American Embassy in Bangkok have met with Suh and her daughter the pastor said He estimated that it would take about four months for their asylum claims to be processedAn embassy spokeswoman in Bangkok declined to comment The United_States has accepted 74 refugees from North_Korea since Kim took power according to State_Department dataDuring the pause in Vientiane the relief of being out of China had washed over the women and the challenges ahead loomed The women had begun to dwell on the handicaps that North_Koreans face I have no passport no papers nothing Suh said Why are our lives so different just because of where we are bornSEOUL The Moranbong Band is back North_Koreas famous girl band had not been seen since without playing a song in December on what was supposed to be their first concert abroadWith their short skirts and high heels whose members were chosen directly by Kim_Jong Un is considered North_Koreas answer to the manufactured saccharine girl bands that have come out of South_Korea in recent yearsThere were multiple theories swirling about their sudden departure from Beijing in December ranging from the Chinese authorities being annoyed at the amount of pro-Kim propaganda in their performance to rumors one of the women tried to defect Some said the concert was too close to the anniversary of former leader_Kim Jong Ils death although that seemed unlikely since authorities on both_sides knew that date was coming upBut this week on the anniversary of his fathers birth and a week after the countrys Kim_Jong Un has been holding a range of celebrations There was a huge banquet and concert for those involved in this months launch of Kwangmyongsong-4 which North_Korea says is a space launch vehicle that put a satellite into_orbit but which pretty much everyone else views as cover for its ballistic_missile programParty time Kim_Jong Un holds a banquet/concert to celebrate rocket_launch - Anna Fifield (@annafifield) Heres what Kim said according to the official Korean_Central News AgencyThe course of conquering space was for the purpose of the revolution and independence rather_than for that of science and it was a fierce struggle to defend the peace and sovereignty from the hostile forces as well as to implement the behests of the great leaders Todays great success was recorded as a glorious page in the history of our Party and country as it gave confidence and courage to our people and dealt a telling blow to the enemies seeking to block the advance of our countryThe reports showed photos of banquet buffet tables complete with huge models of the rocketBut the star of the show was the girl group which performed a number of songs that were broadcast on North_Korean television on WednesdayTheir return was announced in a simple sentence at the end of At the banquet there was a performance of the Moranbong Band celebrating the successful launch of satellite Kwangmyongsong-4 the report saidKim Jong_Uns wife Ri Sol Ju also appeared at the event the first time shes shown up in official media this yearThe textile factories producing made in China goods from compounds just across the Yalu River from North_Korea offer a glimpse into a hidden world that is helping North_Koreas economy to thriveOperated by North_Koreans the factories produce clothes and other goods that are exported under foreign-company labels making it impossible to tell that they have been made with North_Korean hands and have contributed to North_Korean profitsThe thriving operations belie the perception in Washington that US and international sanctions are working to strangle North_Koreas ability to make money While an overwhelming majority of North_Koreans live in poverty the countrys output has been steadily increasing and an estimate by South_Koreas forecasts that the Norths economy will grow this year by a whopping 7percentA lot of that growth comes through Dandong a hive of North_Korean and Chinese managers and traders with middlemen helping them all cover their tracks One local Chinese businessman estimates that one-quarter of this citys population of 800000 is involved in doing business with North_Korea in some wayIn one factory on a recent day dozens of North_Korean women sat under fluorescent strip lights sewing seams and pressing pockets on pants some of which were destined for the United StatesThey are here to make money for the country a North_Korean factory manager said of the workersThis scene is repeated in dozens perhaps hundreds of labor compounds all along the border which in effect is little more_than a line on the map The extensive range of commercial activity suggests that it would be wrong to think that Chinas leadership is now so annoyed with Kim_Jong Un who took control of North_Korea at the end of 2011 after the death of his father that it is tightening the economic screws on the young leader next doorThis is a very sensitive part of China during a week of reporting along the North_Korean border Washington_Post reporters were monitored by police and doing business with North_Korea is a very sensitive subject The textile-factory manager would allow himself to be identified only as Mr Kim he and other North_Korean businessmen who agreed to speak about their operations otherwise did so on the condition of anonymity for fear of jeopardizing their livelihoodsNorth Koreas economy is still a basket case barely more_than one-fiftieth the size of South_Koreas But in talking_about the changes underway the businessmen described a North_Korean economy that is increasingly run according to market principles where people want to be in business not the bureaucracy and where money talksMr Kim the textile manager said he has no qualms about making pants to be worn by men going to work in imperialist aggressor countries such as the United_States South_Korea or Japan the three most hated enemies of his country He was only interested he said in maximizing profits for Pyongyang wherever they come fromIt doesnt matter whether theyre an enemy country or not Kim saidIn the clothing factory the women work 13 hours a day 28 or 29 days a month and are paid $300 each a month one-third of which they keep The rest goes back to the government in PyongyangEven though I want to pay them more I have to send a certain amount home to my country so this is all I can give them Kim said in his office at the factory On his desk an open laptop revealed that visitors had interrupted his game of solitaireThe women work on the third floor wearing their coats inside to guard against the cold and live on the second floor in shared dormitory-style rooms decorated with a banner declaring Lets realize the revolutionary ideas of Kim_Il Sung and Kim_Jong Il alongside portraits of the two former leaders grandfather and father respectively of Kim_Jong Un Signs on the doors read Call each_other comradeNorth Korea is thought to have at_least 50000 workers outside the country earning money for the regime and 13000 of them work in DandongThis neon explosion of a city contrasts starkly with the North_Korean city of Sinuiju on the opposite bank of the river where there is only a smattering of light at nightBut there are signs of large-scale construction on the North_Korean side a half-completed apartment tower with a crane on the top and other new buildings underway Although the traffic crossing the bridge between the two cities is far from jammed it is constant A steady flow of vans and container trucks and the occasional black sedan with tinted windows crossed in both directions over the course of a weekPassenger and freight trains ran regularly carrying cargo such as steel bars for construction and unrefined gold dirtConsumer goods go in the other direction The most popular items to sell in North_Korea these days are TV sets hooked up to solar panels preferably with USB ports for watching smuggled dramasHere North_Koreans are coming to grips with the fundamentals of capitalism even if they still wont use the termOver dinner one night at a Chinese restaurant another North_Korean factory manager happily chatted about his corporate role models Chief among them the titans of South_Korean conglomerates such as Samsung and Hyundai who propelled that countrys rapid economic transformationWhat had he learned from those tycoons in the SouthPerseverance the need to diversify said the businessman who manages a factory that produces goods related to the construction industry and was sporting a Tissot watch Were living in a world where new things keep appearing Who would have thought Nokia would have collapsed Their mistake was sticking with the same productHe has absorbed some of these lessons from the outside_world describing steps he has taken to increase productivity at his factory mainly by creating better working conditions so his employees want to work more and boost his profitsThis is emblematic of the tentative economic experimentation taking place since Kim_Jong Un became leaderReports from inside North_Korea suggest that even state-run companies are increasingly operated according to market principles with managers empowered to hire and fire workers previously unimaginable in the communist nation and conduct businesses the way they see bestThere are frustrations here The biggest one literally has to be the four-lane $350million New Yalu River Bridge a huge steel structure that traverses the river from a glitzy urban development Dandong New DistrictThe whole development project is now on ice partly because of the the businessman and uncle of Kim_Jong Un who was executed at the end of 2013 partly because of his decadent capitalist lifestyle Since then Jangs colleagues have been recalled to Pyongyang or have disappeared sometimes with millions of dollars in Chinese money according to businessmen hereBeijing is clearly none too happy about this and smaller Chinese operators also have complaints about dealing with North KoreaOne Korean Chinese businessman named Ri who exports raw materials from North_Korea said there are lots of fraudsters thereSometimes the North_Korean takes the money but then you cant find the person he said As the middleman I have to take responsibility for that There are some people here whove committed suicide because theyve lost everythingA well-to-do Chinese couple who run an exporting business in Dandong she was carrying a Chanel bag he had an Armani sweater could barely conceal their distaste for the state across the river They used to export kitchen goods to North_Korea but have stopped saying it was too hard to make money thereAsked if they had seen signs that North_Korea is opening up its economy the woman said Oh youre so naiveI havent seen any signs of that her_husband chimed in We built this whole new bridge but North_Korea hasnt built anythingBut while the political chill between North_Korea and China might have had an impact on state-level economic cooperation and those who played in the big leagues with Jang might have been scared away there are still plenty of small businessmen looking for and finding ways to make moneyThese guys are out there to make a buck theyre not the World Food Program and as long as these opportunities exist private profit-seeking market-conforming trade and investment will_continue said Marcus Noland an expert on the North_Korean economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in WashingtonTake Zhang a Korean Chinese merchant who runs one of the 30 or so Chinese businesses in Dandong that ship fabric to North_Korea to be turned into clothes there for European companies Zhang said that he employs a few dozen people on the Chinese side of the border but that his workforce in North_Korea fluctuates between 3000 and 10000 people depending on how many orders he hasNorth Koreans are particularly good at painstaking manual work such as lace-making and hand-stitched beadwork He pulls out his smartphone and shows a photo of a blond woman wearing an intricately embroidered pink and white dress a product of North_Korean laborZhang who speaks Korean and Chinese does_not even need his passport to enter North_Korea He has a permit that allows him to travel back and forth freely He talked about how hes developed good relations with his business partners thereOver the past few years Ive built trust with the North_Koreans he said Every year around the birthdays of the leaders I go there in person and take fruit and flower baskets I pay my respects to the leaders and Im sure my clients report this back to the authoritiesFor North_Koreans who make money on the Chinese side of the border one question is how to get it back to PyongyangSince the start of the Korean War in 1950 when it included North_Korea in the Trading With the Enemy Act the United_States has sought to restrict North_Koreas ability to bank and tradeThis has tightened markedly over the past decade with the United_States imposing rounds of sanctions designed to curtail North_Koreas ability to procure materials for its nuclear_weapons program by shutting the country out of the international financial system The latest measures were imposed in January as punishment for the The restrictions hurt at first But North_Korea has wised up It uses small banks in China or Russia to transfer money several banks in Dandong said it was possible to wire money to Pyongyang for a hefty commission or simply reverts to old-fashioned suitcases full of cash which are much harder to stop with sanctionsThere is a sense in Dandong that sanctions are an issue for Washington and Beijing but that they dont apply here on the borderIm just a local businessman Zhang said adding that sanctions apply to big international companies not to private individuals like us clearly considering his business with North_Korea domestic Anyway we find ways to get around themRi the Korean Chinese trader said that his business partners always want cashSo they come out or I go into North_Korea to settle the bills he said in his office in Dandong running wooden beads through his fingers They like to be paid in US dollars euros Japanese yen (North Koreans returning to Pyongyang apparently like to carry American dollars for the cachet)Everyone interviewed said that it is entirely possible to send cash to North_Korea people usually just carry it in bags over the bridge and that while there might technically be limits on how_much a person can carry in practice there are no checks or at_least no checks that cannot be overcome by greasing a few palmsBut the regime doesnt always want cash The North_Korean businessmen who talked to The_Post said they buy goods according to orders from Pyongyang and ship those back instead Recently they have been asked to send back solar panels and generators to help deal with North_Koreas chronic electricity shortageRelations between China and North_Korea are complicated but one thing is clear Politics and economics are not entirely intertwinedThere is a lot of jumping to conclusions in Washington and discussion about China showing a strong hand to North_Korea said John Park a North_Korea sanctions expert at MIT I dont see the evidence for thatAlthough trade appears to have dipped recently that is the result of sharp declines in prices of commodities such as coal and iron ore two of North_Koreas biggest exports to China rather_than some kind of punishment for Kims lack of deference to Xi_Jinping the Chinese presidentThe young North_Korean leader has not made the traditional pilgrimage to visit the states patronBut pragmatic China Park said does_not want North_Korea becoming unstable and risk unsettling this precarious northeastern part of ChinaAs you must have watched lots of historic soap operas in South_Korea you will know that China and North_Korea are like lips and teeth said the North_Korean factory manager over dinner repeating an old saying about the neighbors Economically nothing has changed Yoonjung_Seo and Hallie Gu

brat packWomen like to wear leggings and tight tops Elle is the most popular brand among women while men prefer Adidas and Nike she said When young people go to China they travel armed with shopping lists from their friends for workout gearAt a leisure complex next to the bowling alley in the middle of Pyongyang they run on the treadmills which show Disney cartoons on the monitors or do yogaThe complex also has a fancy restaurant that advertises for wedding functions glitzy venues cost as much as $500 an hour and a coffee shop where most drinks are priced between $4 and $8 although an iced mocha costs $9Its a cool spot When youre in there it feels like you could be anywhere in the world said Andray Abrahamian who is British and helps run an exchange program that provides financial training to North_Koreans He recently played squash on one of the three courts at the center Its not cheap Its a few dollars for a class Its definitely for people who have disposable incomeNorth Korea as a whole remains economically backward industry has all but collapsed and even in Pyongyang the official salary remains less_than $10 a month but the rise in recent_years of a merchant class has created a whole layer of nouveaux riches in the capital city Donju or masters of money have emerged with the tentative moves toward becoming a market economy that began about 15 years_ago but has picked_up momentum under Kim_Jong Un the third-generation leader who took over the reins of North_Korea at the end of 2011The donju usually hold official government positions in ministries or the military running state businesses abroad or trying to attract investment into North_Korea On the side they trade in everything they can get their hands on including flat-screen TVs and apartmentsThe money that they are making now flows through society through the markets that are present in every population center to the high-end restaurants of PyongyangKim Jong_Un is very pro-market His policy has essentially been benign neglect said Andrei Lankov a Russian historian specializing in Korea who once studied in Pyongyang A number of North_Korean capitalists Ive talked to say that theyve never had it so goodKim 33 has made it a high priority to improve the lives of his fellow millennials in particular He has ordered the construction of amusement parks and water parks and skate parks even a dolphinarium and a ski resort Around the capital volleyball and tennis courts are full of young peopleOn a trip to Pyongyang this month three Washington_Post reporters went to a German-themed restaurant near the Juche Tower that had exposed brick walls and seven kinds of North_Korean beer on tap A huge screen showed ice skatingOn the menu there was a prime steak with a baked potato for $48 although the Wiener schnitzel was more reasonable at $7 Most of the North_Koreans in the restaurant seemed to be opting for the local food although at $7 for a bowl of bibimbap the price youd pay in Seoul it was hardly cheapAt the Sunrise complex theres a sushi bar and a barbecue restaurant where groups of North_Koreans were enjoying grilled meat the waitress recommended cuts of beef that were $50 for a one-person portion and bottles of soju Koreans favorite alcoholic beverage on a recent Saturday nightA North_Korean couple pulled the bamboo curtain across the front of their table when they heard foreigners arrive In Pyonghattan discretion is key If it werent for the little badges they could be South Koreans said one expat in Pyongyang referring to the pins of Kim_Il Sung or Kim_Jong Il the first two generations of leaders that North_Koreans must wear over their hearts Theyre paying 10 to 15 euros for a meal he said He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the trouble his remarks could cause for himThere are other signs that more people have more disposable income Five or six taxi companies are operating although the drivers grumble that business isnt great and a

this privileged setThey lived in China and went to a university there Their father a high-ranking North_Korean official based in China was tasked with earning foreign currency for the regime But they traveled back and forth to PyongyangLee Hyeon-seung described his teenage life in Pyongyang one that involved listening to Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys in the days before the South_Korean wave of K-pop and schmaltzy dramas had arrivedFor the average Pyonghattanite fast fashion from such brands as Uniqlo Zara and H&M is affordable and popular All my friends lived abroad and everyone would bring stuff like this back Lee Hyeon-seung saidBut there were limits Sleeveless tops and too-short skirts are out as is hair dyeIf your clothes are too radical or extreme or theyre not in line with North_Korean style the police might take your name and then your name will be broadcast on the radio Lee Seo-hyeon said The siblings defected together with their mother and high-ranking father to South_Korea in 2014 and they now are in Northern_Virginia hoping to go to college in Washington this fallPlastic surgery already commonplace in the South has come to Pyongyang Double-eyelid operations

medical reasons but plastic surgery is not considered a valid medical reason Lee Seo-hyeon said Being beautiful and being handsome are considered a competitive advantage But how_much of the change is skin-deep and how_much is realSo much of this development is about image Abrahamian said One woman who took part in his training program started a coffee shopThe coffee shops dont make much money Its just a signifier that youre fancy and cosmopolitan he saidOne of the most obvious changes has been the construction boom in the capitalThe high-rise apartment buildings that have popped up in the center of Pyongyang from the Changjon complex near Kim_Il Sung Square to the Mirae Scientists Street look impressive from a distanceBut up close tiles are falling off buildings that are only a year old and electricity supply remains so patchy that the most-sought-after apartments are the ones on the lower stories Who wants a 20th-floor walk-upWith the Mirae Scientists Street complete Kim has ordered the development of Ryomyong Street named for the place where the dawn breaks in the Korean revolutionKim said the area would contain magnificent skyscrapers one is planned to rise 70 stories with eco-friendly design incorporating solar panels and greenhousesThese may all be part of a Potemkin village but they nonetheless underscore the fact that in North_Korea poverty is no_longer equally sharedThere is only one game in town said Lankov the historian CapitalismKim Jong_Un the third generation of North_Koreas ruling dynasty boasted Friday of magnificent and exhilarating advances in nuclear and missile capabilities this year as he convened the in his lifetimeThe congress the first held since 1980 three years before Kim was born essentially amounts to an extravagant state-choreographed spectacle built around Kims leadershipThe intent was clear with each round of rapturous applause for the 33-year-old leader a display of loyalty and bolstered legitimacy for his rule even as North_Koreas defiant policies bring further isolation and pressures But Kim wasted no time in taking another swipe His bravado was aimed directly at the international_community amid alarm over the Norths attempts at military and nuclear expansionIn this year of the seventh party congress the military and the people have accomplished great success in the first hydrogen_bomb test and the launch of an Earth observation satellite to brilliantly illuminate the prowess of Juche Korea Kim said referring to North_Koreas unique ideology that translates as self-relianceUnprecedented results have been accomplished Kim wearing a Western-style suit and tie instead of his usual Mao suit told a packed audience in the ostentatious April 25 House of Culture in central PyongyangKim ordered North_Koreas fourth_nuclear test in January an event he hailed as historic in Fridays address Pyongyang claimed to have tested an exponentially more powerful hydrogen_bomb but outside analysts said it appeared to have been a lesser atomic device similar to the Norths previous test In February Kim then oversaw the launch of what authorities said was a rocket intended to put a satellite into_orbit but outside analysts widely believe to be part of an_intercontinental ballistic_missile program aimed_at enabling North_Korea to potentially strike the continental United_States But other launches since including two intermediate-range missile_launches and another from a submarine were deemed by the United_States and South_Korea to have failed There was no mention of this in Kims triumphant address howeverStill Kims boasts seem to prove the theory that this years provocations from the nuclear and missile_tests to threats to blow up New_York and Washington were part of an effort to bolster the young leaders legitimacyHe followed the general outline of arent we great and paying tribute to his father and grandfather and to the Workers_Party leadership said Michael Madden who runs the blog He was saying we have a strong and prosperous fatherland and were not going to be bullied by big countriesThe authorities in Pyongyang allowed in about 130 foreign journalists including three from The Washington_Post to cover the event apparently wanting to make_sure their message was disseminated to a wide audience But the journalists were not permitted to enter the building where the congress was being held Friday and were instead deposited by their government minders on a street corner some 300 yards from the red-festooned venueAfter an hour they were taken back to their hotel where state television was running dramas centered on revolutionary heroes Even as the congress continued across town the journalists were then taken to an electrical cable factoryIt wasnt until 10 pm that news of the congress was shown on television with Kims speech and the orchestrated cheering supplemented with photos of Kim in a variety of military situations looking happyDetails remain scarce It is not clear when the congress will end or what else will be on the agenda Thousands of people have been on the streets of Pyongyang in the rain practicing for a torchlight parade but no date for the event has been givenNorth Korea has placed huge importance on the congress Previous such events have served as forums to show the ruling partys strength and have occasionally been used as vehicles for major announcements Kim_Il Sung the eternal president of North_Korea and the grandfather of the current leader used the 1980 congress to unveil his son Kim_Jong Il as his successor Kim_Il Sung died in 1994 and Kim_Jong Il in 2011Following in his grandfathers footsteps Kim_Jong Un has elevated the status of the Workers_Party and has effectively moved away from the military first policy promoted by his father by announcing a simultaneous push toward both nuclear and economic_development Analysts say that by calling the congress Kim is continuing this pattern of increasing the stature of the party while at the same_time bolstering his claim on the leadership North_Korea is home to the worlds only communist dynasty and Kim_Jong Un was not even 30 when he became its third-generation leaderKorean culture is Confucian and places a premium on age and seniority but Kim is a good half-century younger than some of his advisers The regime also was unable to lay the kind of groundwork for the current leader that it did for Kim_Jong IlKim Jong_Il was in the public eye moving through a series of official positions for more_than two_decades before he took the reins after Kim_Il Sungs death But there was barely more_than a year between the announcement of Kim_Jong Un as successor and his accession to the North_Korean throneAs a result few analysts were expecting bold initiatives to be unveiled at this congress given the difficulty the Kim regime has had making good on many of its promises Instead they were expecting pronouncements about the strength of the partyThe authorities here had instituted a to prepare for the congress requiring all citizens to work from 530 am until well after dark seven days a week painting buildings paving roads and planting gardens Streets have been decorated with banners and red Workers_Party flags and thousands of people have been practicing for paradesis investigating allegations by two women who said the head of its news department made unwanted physical contact with them while he was employed by another news organization nearly two_decades agoThe women both journalists at the time of the alleged incidents made the accusations in recent_weeks against senior vice_president of news and editorial director at the Washington-based public broadcasting organizationIn response to the allegations NPR said Tuesday that it has placed Oreskes on indefinite leaveIn separate complaints the women said Oreskes at the time the Washington bureau chief of the abruptly kissed them while they were speaking with him about working at the newspaper Both of them told similar stories After meeting Oreskes and discussing their job prospects they said he unexpectedly kissed them on the lips and stuck his tongue in their mouths Both of the women spoke to The Washington_Post on the condition of anonymity so as not to damage their employment prospectsThe alleged incidents occurred in the late 1990s the women said Oreskes after working at the Times and the Associated_Press in senior editing rolesThe women spoke with NPRs attorney in charge of labor and employment matters in mid-October She sent the women emails acknowledging that the news organization was looking into the information they providedNPR didnt address any of the specific allegations when contacted by The_Post for comment Instead it issued a statement reading We take these kinds of allegations very seriously If a concern is raised we review the matter promptly and take appropriate steps as warranted to assure a safe comfortable and productive work environment As a matter of policy we do not comment about personnel matters A spokeswoman Isabel Lara offered no further comment Oreskes didnt respond to multiple requests for commentThe 63-year-old editor is the latest media figure whose conduct has been called into question by women who worked for him or who sought employment when he was in a position to wield power over hiring and firing Allegations against former New Republic editor Leon Wieseltier and political journalist Mark Halperin have also come to light in the past monthBoth complainants say Oreskess alleged behavior had a lasting impactOne of the women said her encounter with him permanently damaged her confidence She was in her late 20s at the time recently arrived in Washington from a small Western town When I first went to see him it was after screwing up my nerve to try to be bold and maneuver myself into a better job and after what_happened with him I never really tried that again she saidThe women said they met with Oreskes after he expressed an interest in reviewing their work and giving them career advice possibly with an eye toward hiring them as reporters Neither was ever hiredThe first woman said she met Oreskes at the Times offices in the Army and Navy Club Building in downtown Washington Afterward she said he took out a personal ad in the Washington City Paper aimed_at her It read Saw you at the Army-Navy Building Loved hearing your life story and your ideas Hope you get this message Let_me knowShe recounted that a week later he emailed her to ask why she hadnt responded to his ad The woman said she was unaware of it and had to search for it What was especially creepy about it was that he put it in the wrong place in the paper she said in an_interview Instead of appearing in the Missed Connections section the ad was in a section called Adult Services that featured thinly disguised offers of prostitutionThereafter she said Oreskes invited her to have lunch in a room at the Watergate Hotel catered by room service She declined the offerShe nevertheless maintained contact with him hoping to keep her job prospects alive She says that when she mentioned to him that she was traveling to New_York for a job interview at the New_York Daily News he told her to book the flight he planned to take the same_day They shared a cab into the city from the airport At the end of the trip he leaned against her kissed her and slipped his tongue into her mouth she saidThe worst part of my whole encounter with Oreskes wasnt the weird offers of room service lunch or the tongue kiss but the fact that he utterly destroyed my ambition she saidThe second woman recounted a similar sequence of events After booking him on a TV program that she was producing and mentioning that she wanted to return to print reporting he offered to review her published work They agreed to meet at a local restaurant but at the last minute Oreskes called and said he had a trip planned that day and was running late He asked to meet at her apartment She agreedThe apartment meeting went off without issue although the woman recalled feeling uncomfortable when Oreskes placed his hand in the small of her back as she showed him around her apartment She then offered to drive him to Reagan National Airport for his flight As she pulled to the curb Oreskes said goodbye then kissed her unexpectedly she saidI was frozen she recalled I was shocked I thought What just happened She said she drove 100 feet pulled over and called her boyfriend to tell him about the incidentLater she said she got a voice-mail message from Oreskes saying how_much he enjoyed meeting her and that he looked forward to seeing her againAbout two months later she booked him on the TV program again and invited him to lunch She arranged to meet him at a restaurant in the center of Union Station I looked him in the eye and I said You kissed me and it was totally inappropriate Thats not the way I want to get ahead in this business His jaw dropped He said I was overcome with passion I couldnt help myselfNeither woman complained at the time both believed that their complaints would be ignored and would jeopardize any chance of working for the TimesBoth said they were motivated to come forward now by NPRs coverage of recent sexual_harassment episodes especially those involving The idea that hes in charge of that coverage is just so hypocritical to me one woman said Its sickening I want to say You owe me a public apology You should recuse yourself from NPRs coverage of harassment Two people who worked at the Times with Oreskes around the late 1990s recalled that he focused extraordinary attention on another young woman who worked as a news aide in the Washington bureau I would call it pestering said one editor It made [the woman] really nervous There was excessive phone calling [by him to her] and messages that he wanted to meet her outside the officeThis account was confirmed by Jill Abramson who was Oreskess deputy at the time Abramson who went on to become and is now a columnist and said in an_interview that she regretted not confronting Oreskes about his behaviorIf I had to do it again I would have told him to knock it off said Abramson about the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill harassment case I_think I should have raised this with [the Times human resources department] Maybe confronting him would have somehow stopped him from doing it to another womanAbramson said she hesitated in part because the young woman didnt want to raise the issue but did want Oreskess alleged behavior to stop But Abramson said I dont really feel it was in a gray area in retrospect I should have stopped himThe Times takes all allegations of sexual_harassment seriously and we are looking into it a spokeswoman for the company saidEventually another editor passed the word to a senior editor in New_York who gave Oreskes a father-son talking-to as one editor put it warning him to steer clear of the young woman The young woman eventually landed a job at another publication in WashingtonOne of the women who complained about Oreskes to NPR said she thought she saw him a few months_ago at her gym for the first time in years I just about had a heart_attack she said I fled the building feeling sick Im not sure I would want to talk to him long enough for him to apologize even if he wanted toThe latest Republican health-care bill to repeal the Affordable_Care Act would eliminate funds for fundamental public_health programs including for the prevention of bioterrorism and as well as money to provide immunizations and heart-disease screeningsAs part of the the Prevention and Public Health Fund provides almost $1 billion annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Since 2010 the fund has been an increasingly important source of money for core CDC programs today accounting for about 12 percent of the CDCs total budgetThe GOP bill would starting in October of next year No clear replacement has been proposedThis is about protecting Americans so this is about saving lives Anne Schuchat acting CDC director said in an_interview Tuesday referring to the proposed elimination of the fund She and other public_health experts held a briefing at the Capitol on Tuesday on the growing threat of An outbreak can happen anywhere she said Its not a red- or blue-state kind of thing And we want to sustain the defense of Americans health from these new emerging threatsThe CDCs former director Tom Frieden said that if the prevention funding is lost Americans will be at greater risk from vaccine-preventable disease food-borne infections and deadly infections contracted in hospitals Most of the prevention and public_health funds are sent to state and local health departments with more_than $625 million distributed among the 50 states and the District of Columbia last_year Public-health-advocacy groups and state and local public_health officials are warning the Trump administration and Congress of what they describe as the disastrous consequences of eliminating the fund without a corresponding budget increase to compensate for the lossState and local public_health officials plan to meet with members of Congress and administration officials this week to make the case for continued investments in public_health and prevention Cuts in those funds combined with potential federal budget cuts at the CDC and other health agencies could amount to a catastrophic year for public_health funding according to a statement from the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials which represents US public_health agenciesMore than 500 public_health organizations childrens advocacy groups universities and local health departments sent to President Trump last_week warning of the consequences of eliminating the prevention fund Advocates and public_health officials are hopeful that the money will be replaced but there have been few indications that that is forthcomingWe havent heard that expressed by the leadership either in the House or Senate said John Auerbach president and chief_executive of the Trust for Americas Health a public-health-advocacy organization that led the letter-writing effortMost of the attention of the ACA repeal has been on he saidBut if the CDC loses close to $1 billion in prevention funding we will see the loss of very important services that Americans in every city and town across the country have come to rely upon Auerbach saidAmong the personnel and programs that receive money from the prevention fund are the front-line workers inwho must respond to a new scary germ and health departments across the country that help them detect respond to and control Schuchat saidOne of the of the prevention fund is the CDCs immunization program which last_year received $324 million The money is sent directly to states and local communities to improve immunization infrastructure such as registries that allow providers to know which patients have received what vaccines Money from the prevention fund accounted for about 40_percent of the CDCs total immunization program funding last yearLosing this funding would cripple CDCs ability to detect prevent and respond to respiratory and related infectious diseases threats including pandemic influenza according an on the impact of the prevention fundThe prevention fund also supports a CDC-led surveillance program to monitor children at highest risk for exposure For situations such as the recent lead-in-water crisis in Flint Mich its the tool that allows you to identify when theres a cluster of lead cases Auerbach saidsEarly on Monday morning that Paul_Manafort and his former business_partner Rick_Gates were turning themselves in to federal authorities to face charges related to special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_IIIs investigation_into Russian_meddling in the 2016 electionBelow an overview of why Manafort in particular may have been ensnared by Muellers investigationPaul Manafort is a longtime political consultant and lobbyist in Washington His career took two tracks that are important for understanding how we got to this pointThe first is that Manafort helped multiple Republican presidential nominees manage their efforts at their party conventions including Gerald Ford in 1976 Ronald_Reagan in 1980 and 1984 and George H W_Bush in 1988 He also managed Bob Doles 1996 presidential bidThe second is that Manafort also worked on behalf of a number of questionable international actors including Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos and the Russia-backed president of Ukraine Viktor_Yanukovych Yanukovych was ousted in 2014 during the period in which Russia-Ukraine tensions spiked Much more on this below In March_2016 as Donald Trump was trying to ensure his victory in the Republican nomination fight he hired Manafort to help corral delegates for the upcoming convention At the time you may remember there was a lot of talk about whether or not Republican delegates pledged to Trump would hold steady as the convention unfolded Manafort had with that task in 1976 fending off a challenge from Reagan The recommendation to hire Manafort came from Trumps longtime ally Roger Stone whod formed a lobbying firm with Manafort after the 1980 electionManafort accepted a position with the Trump campaign for no salary Manaforts questionable business associations were well known but at the time Trump was still having trouble attracting top-tier Republican staffers who were skeptical that Trump was a viable candidateOnce on the campaign he butted heads with campaign_manager Corey_Lewandowski In late June Trumps children convince him to oust Lewandowski and elevate Manafort who became campaign_chairman He held that senior position with the campaign until August On the day he resigned former House speaker Newt_Gingrich Fox_News Sean Hannity that nobody should underestimate how_much Paul_Manafort did to really help get this campaign to where it is right nowIn addition to hand-picking Manafort led the effort to put down the rebellion at the convention By far most impt person in campaign John Weaver (@JWGOP) For this we need to talk a bit more about Manaforts backgroundIn 2006 Manaforts company (of which Gates was part) signed a multi-year agreement with a Russian oligarch named Oleg_Deripaska apparently based on a in which Manafort outlined a strategy that would greatly benefit the [Russian president Vladimir] Putin Government Deripaska is closely tied to PutinThat same year Manafort began working with Yanukovychs Party of Regions in Ukraine In 2010 Yanukovych was elected as that countrys president In 2014 he was ousted during a popular uprising in the country largely because of his sympathies for RussiaA ledger found in a former Party of Regions office in Kiev reported last_year that Manafort may have received nearly $13 million in off-the-record payments from the party during his time working with them Manafort denied the allegation but the Associated_Press later some of the paymentsAt the time Trump was facing about his relationship with Russia and any financial ties to the country Revelation that his campaign_chairman may have been paid by a Russian-backed political party helped spur Trump to oust Manafort from his positionNoIts important to remember that the investigation by Mueller is looking at Russian_meddling in the 2016 election as well as any possible collusion_between the Trump campaign and Russian agents But as an arm of the Justice_Department Muellers_team is also to investigate any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigationThink about it this way If the police were called to your house to interview you about noise complaint and saw you standing over a dead body holding a knife that might also come up as a subject of conversationThe indictment includes 12 counts focused on a few things Misleading the government failing to register as a foreign agent laundering money and failing to report foreign incomeIt includes a conspiracy charge which is broadly about misleading the government including that Manafort (and Gates) provided false_statements to investigators and failed to register as foreign agents (Manafort eventually did so after his work with the campaign drew attention to himself) This is a charge the Manafort conspired against the United_States on behalf of Russia during the electionThe financial charges relate to $75 million that Manafort and Gates earned overseas $18 million of which was then allegedly laundered by Manafort This money was apparently largely earned through the pairs work in UkraineIts important to note that these investigations predate Manaforts time as head of the Trump campaign In 2014 the FBI began an investigation_into Manafort including (That same year Deripaska accused Manafort and Gates of from him that was meant to be invested in a cable network in Ukraine) The investigation_into Manafort was restarted in the of last_year BuzzFeed that the FBI is investigating wire transfers that were made in 2012 and 2013 In other_words even had he not worked with Trumps campaign Manafort might have faced an indictment like this anywayThe main caveat worth remembering here is that Manafort was out of the campaign by August meaning that he wasnt there for the closing days of Trumps effort That said there are two ways in which Manafort and Russian interests overlapped during his time on the campaignThe first relates to Deripaska the Putin-allied oligarch Shortly after Manafort started with the campaign he emailed a business_partner in Ukraine and asked how his new position to get whole asking if Deripaskas team was aware of his new position Later in the campaign Manafort sought to pass word to Deripaska that a on the campaign might be possible It doesnt_seem to have happened(Worth noting During the campaign the Trump campaign then managed by Manafort worked to in the party platform about arming Ukraine in its efforts against Russia)Manafort was also one of the participants in the infamous Trump_Tower meeting set_up by Donald Trump Jr and involving a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer who was offering dirt on Hillary_Clinton During that meeting Trump Jr described Manafort as being on his phone the whole time hinting that the content was not interesting to the campaign_chairman Later though Manafort turned over from the meeting that hed taken on his phoneIt is possible that the Manafort indictment is meant to serve as leverage in Muellers broader investigation There is no mention in the indictment of Trump In 2006 Manafort bought a condominium in Trump_Tower Other New_York real_estate Manafort in 2012 is listed in the indictment because the money used to buy the properties wasnt included in his tax returnsMore charges could be filed against Manafort in the futureTrump has a pattern of continuing to talk with people hed once hired on the campaign even if theyd been fired Its not clear if that was maintained with Manafort though Manafort did former White_House chief of staff_Reince Priebus shortly_before Trumps inauguration The Daily Beast in June that Gates was a regular visitor to the White_House working with Trump ally Tom Barrack (Barrack recently over Trumps presidency in an_interview with The Post)Below our interactive timeline of how and when Russia and the Trump campaign may have intersectedA few years before he became Donald Trumps campaign_chairman longtime Republican political operative Paul_Manafort went on a spending spree with money funneled through a network of offshore bank_accounts a federal indictment unsealed_Monday alleges He bought a $15 million brownstone in a trendy New_York neighborhood and a $19million home in Arlington Va He paid for three Range Rovers and a Mercedes-Benz landscaping at his Hamptons getaway and pricey improvements at his house in Palm_Beach Fla In all out of more_than $75million that flowed through the offshore_accounts more_than $18 million was laundered with income concealed from the US government and was used in part to cover Manaforts lavish lifestyle the indictment says The indictment of the refined and impeccably dressed former campaign_chairman detailed an alleged scheme in which foreign clients paid millions in exchange for Manaforts consulting services Manaforts lawyer Kevin Downing rebutted the charges Monday saying Manafort was not seeking to launder funds Manafort a confidant of presidents dating back to George_HW Bush and Ronald_Reagan was the biggest name charged thus far in a federal investigation by special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III who is examining possible collusion by Trumps campaign with Russia Manaforts indictment along with charges_against his former business_partner Rick_Gates who also worked for the Trump campaign brought Mueller close to the inner_circle that guided Trumps 2016 victory Manafort and Gates pleaded not guilty and did_not speak to reporters This indictment is tragic for Paul and his family said Manaforts former business_partner Charles Black who said he couldnt speak to the specifics because he hasnt worked with Manafort for two_decades For him and Rick_Gates I just pray that they are innocent Manafort was brought into Trumps presidential campaign in spring 2016 tasked with tracking delegates before becoming chairman The arrival of a seasoned operative had been welcomed at the time by many Republican leaders as a sign that Trump was ready to professionalize a largely undisciplined campaign as he was preparing to secure the GOP nomination But the court_papers unsealed_Monday show how Trump in tapping Manafort also brought aboard a senior strategist with deep ongoing and potentially problematic foreign entanglements For decades Manafort has been known for his dealings with foreign leaders including some with less-than-savory reputations In recent_years in addition to his work for Trump and for a Ukrainian presidential_candidate he has made deals with foreign business titans that have resulted in controversy including one with a Russian oligarch who charged that Manafort and Gates disappeared without paying money they allegedly owed him Manafort and Gates denied the allegation Manaforts journey from being one of Washingtons most sought-after political operatives to defendant in a high-profile federal investigation is a story of a chase for power and money Manafort 68 was raised in Connecticut the son of the mayor of New Britain With a Georgetown University law degree he worked for President Gerald Fords 1976 campaign tracking delegates at the nominating convention He ran Ronald Reagans 1980 presidential campaign in the South Manaforts ascendancy in Washington reached new heights when he became a founding partner in 1980 of the lobbying firm Black Manafort & Stone with Black and Roger Stone the latter a longtime Trump confidant During Manaforts 16 years at the firm his clients included two dictators Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire (now Congo) and Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines who allegedly stole billions of dollars from their countriesIn 1989 Manafort testified before Congress about a deal in which he lobbied to obtain $43million in federal housing subsidies for a New_Jersey project while his firm held an option to buy a stake in the property The firm invested before the subsidies were awarded but Manafort testified that he had a high degree of expectation that they would win approval The technical term for what we do and what law firms associations and professional groups do is lobbying Manafort said For purposes of today I will admit that in a narrow sense some people might term it influence peddlingManaforts globe-trotting lifestyle led friends to dub him the Count of Monte Cristo a reference to the swashbuckling hero of a 19th-century French novel Manafort later became a partner in the firm of Davis Manafort which Manafort owned with Richard Davis As a partner Manafort wooed a Russian aluminum_magnate Oleg_Deripaska Manafort and Davis had proposed setting_up a $200million private equity fund to invest mostly in Russia and Ukraine according to a petition filed by Deripaska one of a number of fund contributors Derispaka invested in the partnership through a company called Surf Horizon incorporated in Cyprus in 2007 Deripaska sought repayment of some of his investment after the 2007 financial_crisis saying in a petition that he was owed $19million from a failed investment in Ukraine Deripaska said in a 2014 petition that he was still waiting to be paid but it appears that Paul_Manafort and Rick_Gates have simply disappeared Deripaskas representative said in 2016 they were still seeking the money but a Manafort spokesman subsequently told the New_York Times that no funds were owed During his time at the Trump campaign Manafort sought to communicate with Deripaska through an intermediary suggesting that his new position provided an opportunity to settle financial disputes according to Manaforts email correspondence which was turned over to investigators this year A turning point for Manafort came in the early 2000s when he became a consultant for Viktor_Yanukovych who would later become Ukraines president One of Yanukovychs supporters was a Ukrainian energy tycoon and Manafort soon tried to do business with him according to a filing in a now-dismissed lawsuit In 2008 Manafort met with Firtash to discuss a proposal to build an $850 million 65-story apartment building in New_York City A lawsuit filed by former Ukrainian prime_minister Yulia Tymoshenko alleged that Firtash worked with Manafort to invest illicit profits from energy deals in Ukraine Firtash and Manafort denied the allegations and the suit was ultimately dismissed Spokesmen for Deripaska and Firtash did_not respond to requests forcommentGates 45 met Manafort when he interned at his firm Black Manafort & Stone Manafort accompanied by Gates worked for Yanukovych and his Party of Regions as Yanukovych won the presidency of Ukraine in 2010 While Manafort said he was working for a pro-Western politician who embraced democracy Yanukovych was ultimately seen as aligned with Russian President_Vladimir Putin Between 2012 and 2014 Manaforts firm was paid $17 million by the Party of Regions according to Manaforts belated filing under the Foreign_Agents Registration_Act As part of Mondays indictment Manafort and Gates were accused of hiding their lobbying work for Ukraine in violation of the registration requirements The following year in 2015 Manafort owned an apartment at Trump_Tower in New_York City and had invested in other properties By early 2016 Manafort wanted to join Trumps presidential campaign He hadnt been in close touch with Trump for years so he sought out one of Trumps oldest and closest friends Thomas J Barrack Jr to serve as a conduit Barrack and Manafort were also longtime friends Barrack a billionaire who runs a real_estate investment company said in a recent interview that the only financial deal he had ever made with Manafort was around 2004 when he lent $15 million for a house owned by Manaforts wife Barrack said the loan was paid back at market rate in 14 months Shortly after Trump lost the Iowa caucuses Manafort met Barrack at the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills Paul came to me and said I really need to get to [Trump] I_think I can be really effective at the convention Barrack said Barrack said in the interview that he sent materials about Manafort to Trumps_son-in-law Jared_Kushner and Kushners wife Ivanka Trump Barrack had known both of them for years In the email Barrack wrote that Manafort would be a killer at the job Trump agreed to hire Manafort who said he would work without pay Manafort subsequently became campaign_chairman During his time in the position Manafort attended a June 9 2016 meeting with Kushner and Donald Trump Jr at which a Russian lawyer was said to have damaging_information about Hillary_Clinton The meeting is not mentioned in the indictment but it has been a focus of Muellers investigation_into whether Russia colluded with the Trump campaign Manafort resigned in August 2016 after reports of his ties to Yanukovych and the publication of a ledger in Ukraine that showed millions of dollars of supposedly off the books payments to Manafort from the Party of Regions a claim Manafort has denied Barrack invited Manafort to join him on his yacht off the coast of Greece He got fired and I felt terrible Barrack said When Manafort called he was depressed I said I have got five guys on a boat and Join us He came over and he spent four or five days figuring out what he would do nextBarrack subsequently hired Gates for two positions first to be deputy chairman of the Presidential Inaugural Committee of which Barrack was chairman and second as a Washington-based consultant of his company Colony NorthStar Gates remained in the latter position until the time of the indictment when his contract with the company was terminated according to an official familiar_with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasnt authorized to speak_publicly During their work in Ukraine starting in 2008 Manafort and Gates allegedly devised a scheme to defraud banks and other institutions by wiring money to accounts in a way that laundered the funds without paying taxes Details of Manaforts luxurious lifestyle and income were spread on social_media in February when hackers exposed a cache of more_than 285000 personal messages purportedly stolen from the iPhone of Manaforts daughter Andrea Manaforts spokesman previously confirmed that the phone was hacked and that some of the texts placed on line were authentic but he has declined to authenticate the entire cache In one of the posted text messages Andrea Manafort wrote to her sister in 2015 Dont fool yourself The money we have is blood money Rosalind Helderman and Alice_Crites contributed to this_reportThe United Stateswill

mansion before he was arrested according to a court documentThe suspect identified as Jonathan Tuan-Anh Tran 26 made it all the way to the exterior of the White_House which he walked alongside and then hid behind a pillar before he was spotted and apprehended near the South Portico entranceThe court document released Saturday evening omits any reference to alarms sounding and suggests that the first realization of an intruder was when a uniformed agent saw the suspect up to 200 yards from where he entered The US Secret_Service declined to answer_questions about how the man penetrated so deep onto the White_House grounds citing an ongoing investigationIn a brief statement earlier Saturday the agency said the suspect had breached the outer perimeterA DC Superior Court judge ordered Tran detained through the weekend He was charged with entering restricted grounds while carrying a dangerous weapon Tran is expected to appear in federal court Monday He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted The charges were upgraded from his initial arrest for unlawful entryTrans court-appointed attorney Gregg D Baron asked that his client be released But Judge Jennifer DiToro ruled him a flight and safety risk Tran appeared wearing a blue zip-up sweatshirt khaki jeans a white T-shirt and glasses He made no public statementA federal law_enforcement official said Tran has no prior criminal record and had no previous history with the Secret_Service The official spoke on the condition of not being named to discuss information about the suspect that is not usually made public by police Tran is from Milpitas just outside San JoseTran told a Secret_Service officer that he has been called schizophrenic according to the criminal complaint He had the Mace in a jacket pocket and a book bag with a book on Trump a US passport and an Apple laptop the complaint saysOn the computer the Secret_Service said it found a letter addressed to Trump discussing Russian hackers and that he had information of relevance Tran alleged in the letter that he had been followed and that his phone and email were being read by othersPresident Trump who was in the residence at the time of the breach said the Secret_Service service did a fantastic job last night and he described the suspect as a troubled personSurveillance video showed Tran jumping a fence near the Treasury Building on East Executive Avenue He was arrested about 1138 pm According to the criminal complaint Tran told the arresting officer I am a friend of the president I have an appointmentFriday nights fence jumper is believed to be the first since Trump took_office In the previous two years many people tried or succeeded in getting into one of the most secure residences in the world Last year the Secret_Service added small spikes or pencil points to the top of the six-foot fence that surrounds the White_House complex The agency also announced a plan to raise the height of the fence to 11 feet by 2018Perhaps the most serious breach was on Sept 19 2014 when Omar Gonzalez climbed over the north fence and made his way deep into the White_House When he was finally tackled by an off-duty Secret_Service agent in the ornate East Room he was found to have a knife in a pants pocket Two hatchets a machete and 800 rounds of ammunition were found in his car nearby Secret_Service Director Julia Pierson resigned two_weeks laterAfter that incident the Department of Homeland_Security flagged as a serious concern that not all officers on the complex were aware or heard the alarm that should have alerted them to a jumper crossing the fence line In that case a fence alarm did sound but several radio and communication failures prevented some officers from hearing itRecently departed Secret_Service director Joseph Clancy had pledged to fix the vulnerabilities that allowed the 2014 jumper to get so close to the presidential familys residence John Wagner contributed to this reportIts official Truth is deadFacts arepasseAnd this sentiment Oxford Dictionaries has selected post-truth as 2016s international word of the year after the contentious and an caused usage of the adjective to skyrocket according to the Oxford University PressThe dictionary defines post-truth as relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal beliefIn this case the post- prefix doesnt_mean after so much as it implies an atmosphere in which a notionis irrelevant but then again who says you have to take our word for it anymoreThroughout a grueling presidential campaign in which accusations of lies and alternate realities flowed freely in every direction hundreds of fact_checks were published about statements from both Donald Trump and Hillary ClintonDozens of media outlets found that Trumps relationship with the truth was well complicatedWe concede all politicians lie Nevertheless Donald Trump is in a class by himself She cited who described Trumps dishonesty in May as qualitatively different than anything before seen from a major-party nomineeNone of this seemed to matter significantly to those who supported himThere is no_doubt that even in the quadrennial truth-stretching that happens in presidential campaigns Trump has set records for fabrication days before the electionAnd yet Cillizza noted Trump was seen as more honest than Clinton by an eight-point margin according to released on Nov 2Post-truth was selected after Oxfords dictionary editors noted a roughly 2000 percent increase in its usage over 2015 it was appearing with far more frequency in news articles and on social_media in both the United Kingdom and the United StatesThe first spike came in June driven by therhetoric leading up to Oxford Dictionaries President Casper Grathwohl said in a statementPost-truth usage spiked again in July after Trump secured theRepublican presidential nominationIts not surprising that our choice reflects a year dominated by highly-charged political and social discourse Grathwohl said Fueled by the rise of social_media as a news source and a growing distrust of facts offered up by the establishment post-truth as a concept has been finding its linguistic footing for some time Post-truth was selected as the 2016 word of the year even before results of the election were knownsaid Katherine Martin the head of US dictionaries for Oxford University PressWe choose words that are going to highlight the interplay between our words and our culture Martin said The final word of the year is meant to be one that captures the ethos mood or preoccupations of that particular year and to have lasting potential as a word of cultural significanceThe Washington_Posts own Fact_Checker blog which published 314 fact_checks of the candidates who ran for president during the 2016 election cycle has noted that in many ways it was an unbalanced race but didnt go so_far as to endorse the term post-truthI have never been a fan of the word post-truth since its a facile way to describe basic human behavior since the first words were spoken The Fact_Checkers Glenn Kessler said in an email People have always been swayed by emotions and personal beliefs As fact checkers we give people the factual information and context for statements made by politicians What people do with those facts is up to them The Fact_Checkers Michelle Ye Hee Lee noted that of the blogs 314 fact_checks for this election 168 were about claims made by Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary_Clinton And ofTrumps average Pinocchio rating was 34breaking Rep Michele Bachmanns previous worst Pinocchio average of 308 in 2012Clinton on the other hand ended up with an average Pinocchio rating of 22 putting her in the same range as President Obama and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney she saidAnd what did people do with these facts They elected Trump the 45th president of the United StatesFor what its worth post-truth is not to be confused with truthiness a subtly different term that described the phenomenon of Now Im sure some of the word police the wordinistas over at Websters are gonna to say hey thats not a word said Colbert in the 2005 segment that introduced the word Well anybody who knows me know that Im no fan of dictionaries or reference books Theyre elitist Constantly telling us what is or isnt true or what did or didnt happenAt the time Colbert was still playing an exaggerated caricature of a conservative political-show hostWhos Britannica to tell me the Panama Canal was finished in 1914 he continued in the segment If I want to say it happened in 1941 thats my I dont trust books Theyre all fact no heartMerriam-Webster made truthiness its 2006 word of the yearAnd if anything the rise of truthiness cleared the path for post-truth as in In a post-truth world truthiness is all that mattersGiven that usage of the term hasnt shown any signs of slowing down I wouldnt be surprised if post-truth becomes one of the defining words of our time said Grathwohl the Oxford Dictionaries presidentEach year the Oxford staff selects hundreds of words then narrows that list down through discussions about what words are going to best highlight the ways in which the English lexicon is changing in response to current events said Martin Oxfords head of US dictionariesThis year the shortlist included adulting (often packaged into the phrase adulting so hard as in Im adulting so hard that I bought a leaf blower and increased my contribution to my 401(k) retirement savings plan) and which refers to a comfortable conviviality and feeling of contentment central to Danish culturePost-truth also beat out finalist alt-right a shortening of alternative right defined by Oxford as an ideological grouping associated with extreme conservative or reactionary viewpoints characterized by a rejection of mainstream politics and by the use of online media to disseminate deliberately controversial contentUse of alt-right in 2016 has increased dramatically as well in large part because of Trumps ties to prominent alt-right figures such as This years discussion was a bit more serious and somber than it has been in some other years Martin saidFor those who have forgotten the Oxford Dictionaries specifically this one The Oxford Dictionaries usually announces the word of the year in mid-November But Martin noted there was still time for the mood to shift during the end of the yearWho knows what will happen in the last [weeks] of 2016 she said Hopefully something really wonderful that gives us another ideaLast week Tony_Podesta an eminence in the annals of Washington lobbying threw one of his signature events a big birthday bash at his stately stone

campaign and the Russian_government Podesta abruptly quit his post atop the Podesta_Group the capitals eighth-wealthiest lobbying firm Podestas departure came as and his business_partner Rick_Gates raised questions about the work Podestas firm did with Manafort to buff the image of the Ukrainian government Podesta 74 said he was quitting because of the barrage of criticism hes been getting as special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III pursues the investigationIt is impossible to run a public affairs firm while you are under attack by Fox_News and the right wing media Podesta told employees at the Podesta_Group offices on Monday according to a person_familiar with his remarksFor decades Tony and John_Podesta brothers who share a Jesuit education a devotion to liberal causes and a passion for politics have been central players in Washington And in the past_year both have been drawn into the orbit of scandals Tonys Podesta_Group is one of two firms described in Mondays indictment as having been recruited by Manafort and Gates to lobby on behalf of Viktor_Yanukovych the former president of Ukraine who according to people_familiar with the companys involvement Federal prosecutorsManafort of creating a scheme to mislead the government about his secret work for a Ukrainian political leaderBoth the Podesta_Group and the other firm Mercury Public_Affairs have said they were hired to lobby for a European nonprofit based in Brussels trying to polish Ukraines image in the West But behind the scenes prosecutors allege the real client was a political party led by the former Ukraine president who was friendly with RussiaJohn Podesta a longtime Democratic adviser who led the presidential campaign of Hillary_Clinton has spent the past_year coping with the publication by Wikileaks of tens of thousands of his emails which were hacked by someone using a computer with an address in Ukraine The release of those emails ensnared him in the ornate conspiracy theory in which some anti-Clinton activists came to believe without evidence that sexually abused children were being hidden below a pizza place in Northwest Washington and that John_Podesta was involved with satanic rituals there a notion that police said was bogusIn an emailed statement Monday John_Podesta said I view being attacked by Donald Trump and right wing media as a badge of honor To their opponents the Podestas are quintessential swamp rats exemplars of the permanent Washington establishment Their defenders however view them as the oil that makes the gears of government turnAdvocacy is an important part of our process and its an honorable profession said former senator Tom Daschle (D-SD) now a lobbyist Both Podestas have been enormously successful but were in as toxic an environment as anyone living today has ever seen The quality of governance has suffered immensely as a result The brothers although close are quite differentTony is more gregarious and outgoing and John is more introspective and quiet but they are brothers and they are still close said Ron Klain who was chief of staff to vice presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore John is the eminence grise of the Democratic_Party and all the efforts by Republicans and completely crazy people to discredit him have not changed thatTony Podesta has been a pivotal figure in the murky connections between policy and politics becoming wealthy on fees from industries and foreign entities that want something from Congress and the White_House He also bundles big donations and dispenses them to politicians who might someday be helpful to those lobbying clientsHe and his former wife Heather Podesta held lavish fundraisers for Democratic candidates at their home which boasted a world-class art collection and a wine cellar with thousands of bottles The Podesta brothers mother made the pesto Tony dressed the part of a man in full he sported eye-catching neckties and red Prada loafers The pope wears Prada he once told a reporter and so do I(Heather and Tony several years_ago according to court_records and news reports they spent 109 hours with a mediator before coming to a settlement on how to divide their art and other properties)Although the brothers created their lobbying firm together in 1988 John_Podesta has spent most of his career inside government He had several jobs in Congress and was President Bill_Clintons chief of staff and counselor to President_Barack Obama Theyre brothers but they chose different roads to go down to craft good public policy said Rep Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn) who knows both Podestas Tony_Podesta worked on a string of losing Democratic presidential campaigns from Eugene McCarthys 1968 bid on through Hubert Humphrey Ed Muskie George McGovern Ted Kennedy Walter Mondale and finally Michael Dukakis in 1988Thats when the brothers created Podesta Associates which became the Podesta_Group representing some of the countrys biggest and most_powerful businesses including Walmart Bank of America and BP (The Washington_Post employed the firm in the early 2000s when it was part of a public company controlled by the Graham family then-owners of The Post)The Podesta_Group collected $252 million in fees over the past two_decades according toThis year the firms top clients are Mylan a pharmaceutical company Wells Fargo Crawford Group the parent of Enterprise car rentals and Lockheed Martin the defense contractor according to federal recordsAlong the way the firm also represented a number of foreign entities including the government of Egypt under ex-dictator Hosni MubarakMore and more foreign countries turn to lobbyists to do work that diplomats once did themselves said James Thurber a government professor at American University who studies lobbying Things have gotten so much more complex in the last thirty years in the business that foreign companies and foreign countries do in WashingtonMondays indictments described a multitiered arrangement in which Manafort and Gates are alleged to have pulled the strings as the other firms cited only as Company_A and Company_B were the publicly acknowledged lobbyists for the Brussels group Sources familiar_with the two companies work said the descriptions in the indictment indicate that Company_A was Mercury and Company_B was the Podesta GroupThe Podesta_Group has fully cooperated with the Special_Counsels office and taken every possible step to provide documentation that confirms compliance with the law said Molly Levinson a spokeswoman for the firm She said the work the firm did was in support of Ukraines admission to the [European Union] and the Brussels group certified that it was neither funded by nor directed by a government or political partyMichael McKeon a partner at Mercury said his firm disclosed that it worked for the Brussels group with the intention of aligning Ukraine with western democracies generally and the European_Union specificallyIn 2012 when Manafort and Gates first sought out the two firms to lobby for their business associate in Ukraine Gates wrote to Mercury that the firm would be representing the Government of Ukraine in DCDays after Donald Trump won the 2016_presidential election he summoned Preet Bharara to Trump_Tower The president-elect wanted to talk to the US attorney for the Southern_District of New_York about his futureAfterward Bharara one of the most influential prosecutors in the country best known for going after Wall_Street as well as members of both political parties told_reporters hed been asked whether he wanted to stay onThe President-elect asked presumably because hes a New_Yorker and is aware of the great work that our office has done over the past seven years asked to meet with me to discuss whether or not Id be prepared to stay on as the United_States attorney to do the work as we have done it independently without fear or favor for the last seven years Bharara said in a brief statement to reporters after meeting with Trump Three months later Bharara is suddenly out of a job part of an ouster of 46 US attorneys appointed by President_Barack ObamaBhararato tender his resignationIt was an abrupt end to Bhararas nearly-eight-year tenure prosecuting powerful people in finance and politicsI did_not resign Moments ago I was fired Being the US Attorney in SDNY will forever be the greatest honor of my professional life Preet Bharara (@PreetBharara) In 2015 described Bharara as the most_powerful prosecutor in the country for whom no target is apparently too big Bharara also had developed a reputation for wit and outspokenness FBI_director James_B Comey said the impression he gave was if Jon Stewart was a prosecutorBhararas style drew appreciation from some legal scholars but also reprimands from others for showboating as Jenkins reportedOnce Bharara opened a speaking engagement before a roomful of financial traders by saying I just want to apologize in advance that I dont have enough subpoenas for all of you As the audience broke out in laughter he said Im just kidding Pause I do have enoughDuring his tenure Bharara has indicted 17 prominent New_York politicians for malfeasance 10 of them Democrats Jenkins reported He also investigated New_York Gov Andrew M Cuomo after he closed an ethics commissionIn 2012 he was named one of Time Magazines most influential people The write-up a conservative legal scholar and an old buddy of BhararasWithout drama his Manhattan team has battled terrorism convicting the Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad crippled international criminal networks run by Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout Jamaican drug trafficker Christopher Coke and Colombian rebel group FARC and in March secured a half-billion-dollar forfeiture from computer contractor SAIC in the biggest fraud ever against New_York City Those are good cases well prosecutedBharara was an outspoken man in a job that has been held by vocal and politically aspirant predecessors including former New_York Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani and ComeyAlong with his bipartisan prosecutions Bharara developed a reputation for being tough on insider trading although he was criticized for the lack of prosecutions that followed the financial_crisis Bharara defended himself saying it was far harder to jail independent business executives because they had consulted attorneys every step of the wayIt is a very difficult thing to put a person in jail when they say I asked my lawyers to do the best they could and tell me what Im supposed to do and they are independent and they were paid a fee Bharara said in 2014 So those are among the various obstacles you have By then were pondering Bhararas ambitions for higher office Bharara insisted he had none and in many other interviews had given every indication that he intended to stay in prosecution for the long haul In the early days of the presidential primary race he would do his job forever if I couldI mean look I care about public service I care about honest government Bharara Im a prosecutor Im a lawyer This is what I plan to do for a long timeHe also half-jokingly told Melber that it took some time for his parents who immigrated to the United_States from India with nothing to appreciate his new jobAs I joked theyve finally gotten over the fact that their Indian American son didnt become a doctor Bharara told Melber But it took you know doing all of this before they finally realized Okay I_guess its not a bad gigAlthough Bhararas future political aspirations remain unclear one thing is certain the former US attorney wont be able to become presidentBharara was born in Firozpur in Punjab India and migrated with his family to the United_States as a toddler His father moved the family to Buffalo after he was granted a fellowship to practice medicine They eventually settled in New_Jersey and Bharara went on to attend Harvard then Columbia Law SchoolHis Indian heritage made him a unique target for critics who called him out for arresting and charging Indian nationalsAs Jenkins notedBhararas heritage did_not prevent him from arresting and charging Indias deputy consul general Indian diplomats reacted with outrage calling him a self-loathing traitor to his heritage and an embarrassed State_Department had to bail out Khobragade with diplomatic immunityEveryone should understand that our motivation is always to do the right thing and we dont pull our punches and we dont care who you are Bharara says unapologeticallyBharara that a lot of people in the country of my birth for whatever reason began to think that it was something having to do with me personally even_though had they inquired a little_bit would have discovered that this office brings cases based on the facts and the law And it doesnt matter you know who you are and what you look like and where youre fromHis own parents he once told Melber wouldnt talk explicitly about public service when we were growing up But it was very clear that they thought it was important to give back And maybe its you know common for immigrant families who got so much from America that they think thatPresident Trumpis

many Republicans wanted replacedPowell a Republicanis widely viewed as a safe pick who is unlikely to make any dramatic changes to the Feds handling of the economy at a time when the stock market is soaring and unemployment is at a 16-year lowUnlike some of the other candidates Trump considered Powell has been supportive of Yellens policy of slowly raising interest_rates which have been at historic lows for nearly a decade as the Fed looked to help the economy recover from a massive recession Trump has expressed interest in keeping rates low as he aims to stimulate the economy and get more Americans higher-paying jobsTrump said Friday he has someone very specific in mind for the FedIt will be a person who hopefully will do a fantastic job Trump said in a short video message posted on Instagram and TwitterThe Fed operates independently from the White_House Much as with Supreme_Court nominees once Powell is confirmed Trump will not have any sway over him making the choice a critical one because the Fed has the power to help stimulate the economy or slow it downif the central bank governors believe the economy is heating up too quicklyThe chairman of the Federal_Reserve has control of the most_powerful lever to influence world prosperity says Gary Richardson professor of economics at the University of California at Irvine and the former officialFed historian Ifthe chair makes good decisions about interest_rates billions of people around the world will be better off If the chair makes mistakes he or she can put hundreds of millions of people out of work around the globePowell is no stranger to the Fed and the important role it serves at the heart of theglobal economy Hes served as a Fed governor a top leadership role within the central bank since 2012 He also has deep experience on Wall_Street and in Washington Early in his career he served as undersecretary of the US Treasury Department for former president George_HW Bush Then he became a partner at private equity firm The Carlyle Group amassing a sizable fortune of between $20 million and $55 million that allowed him to then take a job working for $1 as an expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center after he left the investment firmAlthough Powell has long been a Republican former colleagues at the Fed and Bipartisan Policy Center describe him as right-leaning but not an ideologuePresident Barack_Obama originally nominated Powell to the Fed board Powell studied law at Georgetown University not economics but many say he has become well versed inmacroeconomics in his time at the FedWhen he showed up at the Fed he basically did_not know much about macroeconomics or monetary policy says Seth Carpenter chief US economist at UBS who spent 15 years at the Fed including time overlapping with Powell He made a conscious decision to spend a lot of time with staff and colleagues to learn as deeply and completely as possiblePowell has developed a reputation in Washington as a consensus builder who studies issues extensively before making decisions He never dissented on any of the Feds decisions in his time on the board opting instead to try to work behind the scenes when he felt it was important to sway the course of actionPeople familiar_with Trumps thinking on selecting Powell who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the president felt Powell would bring stability and continuity to the Fed because so many know him there already but Powell was also likely to help pull back some regulations on financial institutionsTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin pushed hard for Trump to select Powellafter working with him recently toreview ways to roll back regulations on financial firms a goal of the Trump administration In public speeches Powell has indicated he thinks that regulations put in place after the financial_crisis went too farMost on Wall_Street welcomed the news that Powell is the likely nominee Investment bank Deutsche Bank put out a note last_week to clients saying Powell would be the best choice if Trump did_not want to keep Yellen onBut some liberal groups including Fed Up were disappointed arguing the selection of Powell is an attempt to make the Fed morefavorable to big banksJerome Powells most_important qualification is that he served with Janet Yellen His confirmation should depend on his willingness to follow in Yellens footsteps on both monetary and regulatory policy said Shawn Sebastian co-director of Fed Up a campaign from the Center for Popular DemocracyWhen Kim Young-sam became South_Koreas first democratically elected civilian president in 1993 he vowed to cure the country of the Korean disease the political corruption that had become endemicKim oversaw an ambitious drive to clean up the country even authorizing the arrest of his two immediate predecessors on corruption-related charges although he eventually became infected by the disease himself when his son was arrested on corruption and bribery chargesCorruption bribery embezzlement and the abuse of power have been modulated over the past generation but remain indisputable components of official South_Korea as the scandal now engulfing President Park_Geun-hye showsPark is set to be questioned by prosecutors as soon as Thursday about her role in an influence-peddling scandal revolving around a friend of 40 yearsAlthough every South_Korean president since democratization in 1987 has become ensnared by corruption in one way or another Park will become the first incumbent to be grilled by prosecutors She cannot be charged while in office but could be indicted after she leaves which may happen sooner than expectedMost analysts had thought Park would try to ride out the storm until the next election in December 2017But after a third week of huge protests hundreds of thousands gathered in central Seoul on Saturday drawing comparisons to the demonstrations that ended military rule almost 30_years ago the chances of her being forced out of office have increased Eurasia Group a consulting_firm that assesses risk now puts the probability at 70percent The situation has reached a point of no return Moon Jae-in an opposition politician and presidential hopeful said Tuesday Up to then he had demanded that she hand over day-to-day running of the country to the prime_minister chosen by parliament But now he said that was no_longer sufficient I along with the citizens will carry out a nationwide campaign for Parks resignation until she declares she will unconditionally step aside he saidThe scandal flared last_month when it emerged that Park widely considered a distant figure was being secretly advised by a friend of 40_years a woman with no policy background but with ties to a religious cultThe woman Choi_Soon-sil is accused of receiving classified_information and of using her ties to Park to raise up to $70million from big business groups for two foundations most of which she is said to have siphoned off and to get her daughter into a prestigious university She is in custody and is expected to be indicted this weekParks attempts at quelling the public fury over this shadow president have amounted to nothing as shown by the increasingly large protests against herThe scandal has highlighted just how prevalent the Korean disease remainsIt encompasses the presidential Blue_House with some of Parks aides suspected of helping Choi raise money and big business with Samsung alone said to have given $20million directly to Choi or to her foundations Senior officials from big conglomerates including Samsung Hyundai Motors and LG have been called in for questioning This adds to the woes at Samsung already reeling from the withdrawal of one its flagship products the Galaxy Note 7 phoneIt also involves the powerful prosecutors office which is accused of being too political A prominent former prosecutor who served as a senior presidential secretary to Park is now under investigation on suspicion of helping Choi and tipping off big businesses to pending raids And hard-charging prosecutors often end up working in the Blue_House or at the big conglomerates further cementing personal links_between institutions Stephan Haggard professor of Korea-Pacific studies at the University of California at San Diego said the scandal is bigger than WatergateIts the scope of the violations that are in play he said Theres the classified_information the foundations the university There are half a dozen discrete things that are likely to be illegalRa Jong-yil a former deputy director of South_Korean intelligence also sees echoes of the Watergate scandal The easiest way to fix this is for the president to resign just like Nixon did Ra saidThe kind of corruption seen in South_Korea is partly the result of government-sponsored industrialization It was Parks father authoritarian president Park Chung-hee who supported the creation of corporate giants such as Samsung and Hyundai encouraging links_between government and business in the 1960s and 1970s that remain strong todayPark learned about the coalition of business and politics from her father said Kim Dong-choon a professor of social sciences at Sungkonghoe University Parks watch stopped in the 1970s he saidThis homogeneous nation also pits friendship and loyalty against following the lawThis is a very communitarian society and theres an expectation that youre going to go with the flow said Scott Snyder a Korea specialist at the Council on Foreign RelationsIn America friendships are run as contractual relationships and people know the boundaries operate within social rules of etiquette that generate a little more distance Snyder saidBut in South_Korea creating this kind of distance is contrary to the bond of friendship The concept of butak literally favor but with a deep sense of obligation and expectation attached means that it is hard to say no when a friend asks you for something This concept makes it difficult to create checks and balances that can overcome personal networks Snyder saidInstitutions end up being compromised by the fact that Mr Kim at the Blue_House went to elementary school with Mr Lee at the prosecutors office he said Thats the classic struggle that makes corruption endemicThis scandal comes just after South_Korea enacted a new law designed to root out bribery and corruption prohibiting people from spending more_than $27 on a meal for public officials employees of state-run companies or journalistsBut that law was designed to target corruption at the lower end of the scale doing little to address the kinds of issues raised in Choi-gate as it is known hereAlmost two-thirds of people surveyed by the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission in 2014 said they thought South_Korean society was corruptTackling this problem will not be easy said Lee Tae-ho of Peoples Solidarity for Participatory Democracy an activist organizationWe are calling for Parks resignation but because there are many structural problems we are calling for citizens to help solve this problem he said The solutions should come from the political sphere but the political sphere also has problemsLee noted that some left-wing parties had been bannedKim Dong-choon the social scientist said This is not just about Parks and Chois misdeeds but other forces the prosecutorial system the bureaucratic system and the shortcomings that have made this incident possibleThis is a great opportunity for Koreans to rebuild our society and our politics Kim said to overcome old ways of thinking Yoonjung_Seo contributed to this reportHe was he insisted just an academic who had absolutely no contact with the Russian_government Any suggestion that he had offered to play matchmaker between the future president of the United_States and the power players of the Kremlin was he maintained dismissively incredibleOr so he told reportersBut in private exchanges Joseph Mifsud was proud of his alleged high-level Moscow contacts reporting that they had extended all the way to the top Hed had he told a former assistant late last_year a private meeting with Russian President_Vladimir PutinThe assistant didnt think much of that claim But the boastfulness matches the portrait of Mifsud sketched in court_papers unsealed_Monday that have made him one of the most critical and enigmatic figures in s investigation_into Russian_interference in the 2016 US election In those papers a plea_agreement for former Trump campaign foreign_policy adviser George_Papadopoulos Mifsud is not named But the Maltese national and London-based academic confirmed Tuesday that he is the professor mentioned in the probeAccording to the court files the professor took an interest in Papadopoulos after the latter joined the Trump campaign Mifsud promised him dirt on Hillary_Clinton compiled by the Russians including thousands of emails He also offered to serve as a go-between in Papadopouloss efforts to connect the Trump campaign with the Kremlin even going so_far as introducing Papadopoulos to a woman he identified as Putins nieceWhether Mifsud really had the sort of Kremlin contacts that Papadopoulos claims he advertised is unknown But of how the Trump campaign regarded Mifsuds apparent approach and whether it yielded anything substantive could be a key focus of Muellers investigationMifsud who is in his mid-50s insisted Tuesday that the claims embedded in the court_documents are exaggerated echoing points he had made months earlier in response to inquiries from The Washington PostI have a clear conscience Mifsud told Britains Daily TelegraphMifsud told the Telegraph that he knew nothing about emails containing dirt on Clinton calling the allegations upsetting He also dismissed the disclosure that he introduced Papadopoulos to a female Russian national calling the allegation a laughingstockIn emails to The_Post in response to questions in August Mifsud had played down his connections to Moscow insisting they were purely related to his work as a professorI am an academic I do not even speak Russian he wroteBut the details that emerged Tuesday based on interviews with those who know him his writings and his travels suggested a more complex picture one that better matched the image of the professor in court files as a somewhat obscure European academic who longed for moreHailing from Malta the European Unions smallest nation he parlayed roles advising the government there into top positions with educational institutions that bear exalted-sounding names but are little-known even within academia Those included president of the Slovenia-based Euro-Mediterranean University and honorary director at the London Academy of DiplomacyNatalia Kutepova-Jamom his onetime assistant at the academy said he had set out in 2014 to build his contacts with Russian academics and policymakersShe said that she booked her former boss a speaking slot in 2014 at the Sochi meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club a Russian state-funded think_tank that is seen as close to the Kremlin to speak on economic and international cooperationMifsud later suggested to her that he used those early contacts to open doors for higher-level meetings But she was in disbelief when he told her last_year that his contacts had reached all the way to Putin with whom Mifsud claimed to have had a short private meetingShe said she didnt believe the two met because Mifsud is a too small-time person to meet with the Russian leaderBut Mifsud himself had written about being in the room with Putin to hear him speak at a 2015 event hosted by the Valdai Discussion Club and reported that he had asked a question of Foreign_Minister Sergei LavrovIn that piece for Valdais website he wrote approvingly of Russias policy in Syria saying Putin had walked the talk The US administration of then-President Barack_Obama by contrast was on the defensiveIn a spring 2016 piece about the same_time he was allegedly meeting with Papadopoulos he asserted that he knew Russia quite wellOnline biographies present Mifsud as an authority in the field of international relations and diplomacy across Europe the United_States Russia Africa and the Mediterranean region But his academic work in these areas appears limited He has published in peer-reviewed journals on Maltese education policiesAccording to a biography on the London Centre of International Law Practices website which was deleted Sunday Mifsud served prominently in Maltas Ministry of Foreign_Affairs and worked as an adviser for Maltas Ministry of EducationScotlands University of Stirling said in an emailed statement that Mifsud joined its politics department in May this year as a full-time professorial teaching fellowFormer colleagues said they didnt think of Mifsud as someone with any particular Russian expertiseNabil Ayad who hired Mifsud as an honorary director at the London Academy of Diplomacy where Ayad was founder and director said Mifsuds focus was broadly in the area of diplomacyAs assistant to the Maltese foreign_minister he traveled to many countries and met many heads of state Ayad saidAyad said the institutions work involved occasional trips to Moscow including for collaboration with the Diplomatic Academy of the Russian Foreign MinistryWe tend to deal with governments so I dont_think he has any special connections or relationships Ayad said If a meeting took_place between a Russian official or he introduced someone it must have been by chance not by designBut Mifsud had occasionally gone beyond the role of the typical academic In 2015 he was an observer for elections in Kazakhstan that were sharply criticized by independent groups Mifsuds take was far rosier mirroring the Russian lineThe election he told Kazakh media was consistent with all international normsAt many polling stations was an image that I associate with a family meeting he reported Mifsud told that he introduced Papadopoulos to a program director of the Russian International_Affairs Council a state-funded Russian think_tank that is close to the Foreign_Ministry and that he tried to set_up meetings with experts on the European UnionWe are academics Mifsud told the paper We work closely with everybodyHe said that he met Papadopoulos in Italy in March_2016 and then 10 days later in LondonMifsuds contacts in Moscow go back to at_least 2012 when a delegation from Moscow State Universitys Faculty of Global Processes established a partnership with the London Diplomatic Academy according to publications by the university faculty and a newsletter founded by order of the Russian Ministry of Foreign AffairsBetween 2013 and 2017 Mifsud visited Moscow State University about once each year giving lectures and posing for photographs with the department head Ilya IlyinThe nature of the partnership was not immediately clear although Mifsud had discussed exchange programs and joint research projects The department advertises itself as a stepping stone for graduates to work in the Russian_government the presidential administration federal ministries and agencies the special services and outside of government Alexei Andreev the deputy director of the faculty said in a promotional videoReached on Tuesday by telephone Alexeev played down the departments ties to MifsudI think he is one of those people who has a lot of connections he said Krohn reported from Atlanta and Witte from Berlin Brian Murphy in Washington Andrew Roth and David_Filipov in Moscow and Isaac Stanley-Becker in Oxford England contributed to this reportSEOUL Kim_Jong Uns_regime defied international warnings and conducted a fourth_nuclear test last_month one it claimed was of a hydrogen_bomb and then launched a long-range rocket this month widely viewed as part of its missile programThe international_community has condemned the moves as and has declared that North_Korea must pay for its actions Some countries including South_Korea Japan and the United_States have taken direct action while negotiations continue in the United_Nations on a package of measures that could pass the Security_Council where China and Russia are veto-wielding permanent members Many Western nations together with South_Korea and Japan want tough sanctions but China is concerned about destabilizing its neighbor and has previously insisted on watering down any measures against North_Korea Heres a rundown on the sanctions that are in place against North_Korea as of Feb 19President Obama has enacted the North_Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 which passed the House and Senate with almost unanimous supportDaniel Wertz of the National_Committee on North_Korea has produced an excellent readable summary of the legislation Essentially the lawThe Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control has repeatedly taken action since President George_W Bush signed an executive_order in 2008 that declared the North_Korean threat to the United StatesThe sanctions have targeted specific North_Korean institutions and people who are alleged to be involved in developing or financing the Norths weapons_programs They ban these companies and people from doing business in the United_States and American companies and people from doing business with themThe OFAC has produced a helpful summary of all its actions to dateThe UN_Security Council has passed four resolutions against North_Korea since Pyongyang conducted its first nuclear_test in 2006 The kind people at the Arms Control Association have compiled a comprehensive summary An even more succinct summary looks like this2006 Resolution 1718 banned North_Korea from conducting further nuclear_tests and prohibited supplying North_Korea with technology and training related to nuclear_weapons development2009 Resolution 1874 imposed after the second nuclear_test tightened sanctions on specific people and companies and expanded the crackdown on arms exports and imports Member states were encouraged to inspect and destroy any cargo on ships suspected of violating the arms embargoJanuary 2013 Resolution 2087 which followed a successful satellite launch strengthened previous sanctions by clarifying a states right to seize and destroy material suspected of heading to or from North_Korea for purposes of weapons development or researchMarch 2013 Resolution 2094 came after North_Koreas third nuclear_test It imposed new financial sanctions aimed_at hindering money transfers and shutting Pyongyang out of the international financial systemSouth Korea imposed unilateral sanctions against North_Korea following the 2010 attack on a Southern naval corvette the Cheonan that killed 46 sailors These sanctions known as the May 24 measures includedPresident Park_Geun-hye has now in retaliation for the January nuclear_test and February

Japan reimposed some of the measures and then added new ones after the recent provocationsThese are the latest measures as The European_Union has imposed rounds of sanctions on North_Korea over the last decade These includeThe full list can be viewedTOKYO North_Korea Friday Heres what we know so farYes it really was a nuclear_test The US Geological Survey said the 53 magnitude seismic event it recorded had explosion-like characteristics and occurred where North_Korea has detonated nuclear devices in the past The Norths first nuclear_test was in 2006and three have been carried_out since Kim_Jong Un took power in late 2011The quake had all the hallmarks of an explosion the waveform is sudden unlike an earthquake and the depth is shallow Plus it happened at a known North_Korean nuclear_test siteHeres a good explanationHow do nuclear blasts differ from natural earthquakes Lawrence Livermore describes [PDF] USGS (@USGS) Not necessarily North_Korea announced that they had conducted a nuclear explosion test and that they had standardized a nuclear_warhead Just because theyre right on the former doesnt_mean theyre right on the latterMaking a nuclear_warhead small and light enough to attach to a missile is a difficult thing Analysts and military chiefs think North_Korea is well on the way to this capability but theres no sign they are there yetAnd even if they do manage to miniaturize a nuclear device and stick it on a missile theres still a whole lot more steps to go through A nuclear missile goes through extremes of heat and cold shakes with vibrations during launch and has to survive re-entry and hit its target Theres a lot of things that can go wrong thereBut North_Korea is And its latest nuclear_test does constitute another step down the path to what some people think is Pyongyangs ultimate aim being able to send a nuclear-tipped missile to the US mainlandSorry about that But its true that this is a pretty scary situation Kim_Jong Un has made it clear that hes determined to make North_Korea a nuclear state and hes certainly shown no inclination to return to diplomatic negotiations aimed_at persuading him to give up his weapons_programs The example always cited in North_Korea analyst circles is Libya Moammar Gaddafi gave up his nukes and look what_happened to himBut heres a nice graphic from the AFP news_agency putting North_Koreas nuclear blasts in historical perspective How do North_Koreas nuclear_tests measure up AFP news_agency (@AFP) Well China is one country that has real leverage_over North_Korea given that it provides economic aid to its neighbor and is its main route for trading with the rest of the world China is always concerned about stability on its borders and has shown itself to prioritize keeping North_Korea afloat over punishing Kim and his croniesThat said China seems pretty angry right_now North_Korea fired three missiles on Monday while Chinese president Xi_Jinping was hosting the Group of 20 summit in Hangzhou and those missiles were technically capable of hitting Hangzhou Not a subtle messageOn Friday Chinas foreign ministry released a statement condemning the test and saying it would work with the international_community to urge North_Korea to return to talks and give up its nukesThe question now is whether China gets serious about enforcing sanctionsFriday marks the Day of the Foundation of the Republic a public holiday commemorating the 68 anniversary of the formation of the North_Korean government by Kim_Il Sung North_Koreas founding president and the current leaders grandfather So its an important day for the regimeBut the test could also have been timed to push back at speculation that the regime is showing cracks after a handful of high-level defections including the and a couple of officials involved in making money for the Kim familyIt could also be a signal to the outside_world that North_Korea wont be cowed The United_States will send an anti-missile battery to South_Korea and China has been supporting UN statements deploring North_Koreas recent actions This is Kim_Jong Uns way of saying youre not the boss of meJapanese sniffer planes went up Friday and there are probably some American ones flying around too Theyll be trying to measure radiation levels and capture gases so nuclear scientists can draw some conclusions about the test Lets see if any gases escape the test tunnel that would give away the nature of the device says Joshua Pollack editor of the Nonproliferation ReviewThen it will be back to the UN_Security Council We can expect meetings and harshly worded statements out of the United_Nations and a push for more sanctions But the question is What else can the international_community do There have been lots of new sanctions_imposed this year a crackdown on mineral exports increased cargo inspections tougher financial limitations and clearly none of them have made Kim_Jong Un stop with the missiles and the nuclear testsThere arent many other options A military strike is out no one has any appetite for another war and striking North_Korea would probably unleash a volley of artillery by the North across the Demilitarized Zone at Seoul home to 20 million peopleTheres another option flooding North_Korea with trade and investment and information and trying that way to convince them to change But with all this defiance theres even less appetite for engagement than there is for military actionIts a classic North_Korean announcement This is Ri Chun Hee a veteran newsreader who was brought out of retirement in January to announce the fourth_nuclear test When she shows up you know its bigWealthy Americans appear to have found a way to get around one of the taxes they are supposed to be paying under Obamacare according tofederal dataThe nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxationa congressional agency published Tuesday projecting a surcharge on profitfrom rich taxpayers investments would produce less revenue thantheyd previously predicted Indeed thecommittee shaved about a quarter off its revenue projection from the one it submitted last_year cutting the estimate bymore than $60 billionThe committee as is typical for its guidelines did_not provide an explanation for the projection in reduced revenue but tax experts said they think it might bebecausethe wealthy aregetting around the lawThis tax on investments has been eroded over time as taxpayers have kind of figured out ways to put income into untaxed forms said Mark Mazur the director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center Taxpayers planning techniques change over time so you would see it in the estimates with a lagIn the last several years Treasury has reported that weve_seen some significant tax avoidance said David Kamin a former economic adviser in Obamas White_House This may be one reason why JCT has reduced its estimateThe tax in question is a 38 percent fee on gains from certain investments but it only applies to individual taxpayers with more_than $200000 in annual incomeor to married couples making more_than $250000There are a few ways that wealthy taxpayers can avoid the tax One approach is for taxpayers to place investments in a legal entity known as an S corporation and then to pay themselvesa salary out of the corporations funds The S corporations profits are not technically salaries or wages so they are not subject to payroll taxes At the same_time because a taxpayer is an employee of their own corporation the profits do not qualify as the kind of indirect passive income that would be taxedIn calling for changes analysts in former president_Barack Obamas Treasury Department said that taxpayers who use this technique pay the tax on just 42 percent of the income from their S corporationsThere is an alternativepossible explanation for the drop in projected revenueMazur saidThe committee may be using a morepessimistic estimate of how_much profitwealthy taxpayers will see from theirinvestments and therefore how_much tax theyll pay on themWhatever the causethe committee projected that repealing the tax would eliminate $223 billion in revenue over the coming decade The committees new prediction is that a similar repeal would cost just $158 billion indicating that the staff expects substantially less money from the tax than theydid last yearPart of the discrepancy is thatlast year the committee estimated the effect of repealing the tax immediately while this year the committee considered a proposal to delay the repeal forone year The government would be able to collect some additional revenue during that extra yearThe change in thecommittees estimatehas political implications for Republicans as theywork to repeal Obamacare (officially known as theAffordable Care Act) including the laws tax oninvestment incomeRepublicans are usinga special procedural maneuver known as reconciliation toadvance their proposals through Congress The maneuver allows them to avoid a filibusterfrom Democrats in the Senate but it also requiresRepublicans to present a bill thatwould not result in more forecast borrowing by the federal governmentUnder the old estimate Republicans would have to find new spending cuts new revenue or some combination of the two to make up for the full $223 billion in projected lost revenue The new formula cuts the task down to making up only $158 billion in lost revenueThe Congressional Budget Office is expected to publish its official analysis incorporating the revisionin the coming daysRepublicans generally argue against increasing taxes on the wealthy to pay for social services such as the financial help offered to ordinary families buying health_insurance under ObamasAffordable Care_Act For Republicans these taxes penalize the rich for working investing and contributing to the economyBut Kamin Obamas former adviser argued that Republicans arepushing a giveaway to wealthy taxpayersThese are major tax_cuts providing very significant tax relief to people at the top Kamin said of GOP plans to scrap the tax Instead he said the GOP should take the opportunity to simply close these loopholes so that this tax would raise the revenue that it was supposed to in the first placeThe unconventional administration of President Trump may be causing consternation among American liberals But here in Germany the anchor of the European_Union Trumps rise is helping fuel an unexpected surge of the leftWhat is happening in Germany is the kind of Trump bump perhaps never foreseen by his supporters a boost not for the German nationalists viewed as Trumps natural allies but for his fiercest critics in the center left The Social Democrats (SPD) have bounced back under the charismatic Martin Schulz the former head of the European Parliament who took over as party chairman last_month and is now staging a surprisingly strong bid to unseat Chancellor_Angela MerkelIn a country that stands as a painful example of the disastrous effects of radical nationalism Schulz is building a campaign in part around bold attacks on Trump He has stopped well short of direct comparisons to Adolf Hitler but Schulz recently mentioned Trump in the same speech in which he heralded his partys resistance to the Nazis in the lead-up to World_War II We will never give up our values our freedom and democracy no matter what challenges we are facing Schulz said in a recent speech He added That a US president wants to put up walls is thinking aloud about torture and attacks women religious communities minorities people with handicaps artists and intellectuals with brazen and dangerous comments is a breach of taboo thats unbearableHis anti-Trump platform comes as Germans are questioning American power more_than at any point since the end of the Cold War illustrating an erosion of allied faith in the new era of America first A recent poll found that only 22percent of Germans see the United_States led by Trump as a reliable partner putting it only one percentage point above RussiaThe in France and Britain But buoyed by Schulzs approach his party last_week pulled ahead of Merkels center-right Christian Democrats in opinion polls for the first time in six years Elections are not until September but analysts are giving the SPD under Schulz its best chances to regain power since Gerhard Schrder lost to Merkel in 2005There are different factors that are coming together for the SPD said Ralf Stegner the partys deputy chairman Schulz has provided a new impulse for people who were waiting to come back but also the new American president because Trumps presidency has politicized the German public making them more active and awareWithout naming names Merkel has taken aim at Trump criticizing for instance his refugee ban But Schulz has also accused Merkel of being too diplomatic Germany which shoulders the history of Nazi tyranny is an outlier in containing the current spread of me-first nationalism Even as far-right parties and isolationist politics gain ground elsewhere in Europe the largest right-wing populist party here the Alternative for Germany has fallen slightly in the polls since Trumps electionAt the same_time left-wing parties in Germany have seen a jump in dues-paying members There are also signs that Trumps election is making left-leaning voters in Germany more politically activeTake for instance Kristina Seidler a 28-year-old mother and Dsseldorf resident who works as a substantiality adviser for a textile company She has voted for the SPD before But the day after Trumps victory she signed up as a dues-paying member and party volunteerHorrified by Trumps win she said she sees the traditional left as the only answer and is preparing to put up posters and help with campaigning as the German election season rolls into high gearWhat kind of sign is it for the world when a man who is a racist who treats women so badly can become the president of the United_States Seidler said I thought Its time for me to do somethingPerhaps the biggest single driver of the SPDs new popularity however is SchulzThe SPD is already part of Merkels governing grand coalition with the partys senior operatives filling top cabinet posts Yet its popularity with its left-leaning base has been hampered by that power-sharing deal Under its former chairman Sigmar Gabriel Merkels foreign_minister the SPD was struggling to distance itself from the current governmentEnter Schulz who last_month took over as the partys chairman and candidate positioning himself as an outsider who could mix things up in Berlin A 61-year-old who never finished high_school Schulz has embraced his imperfections openly speaking about his battle with alcoholism He started in local politics becoming the mayor of the western German town of Wrselen before being elected to the European Parliament in 1994He rose through the ranks as a champion of European unity civil_rights and social justice becoming the parliaments president in 2012 He has at times been chided for his tell-it-like-it-is approach drawing the wrath of the Hungarian and Polish governments after decrying democratic lapses in those countriesCritics call Schulz similar to Trump in at_least one regard He is a straight talker who argues against elites and favors the common man He is also blunt a trait that contrasts with Merkel a leader famous for her meandering parsed answersThe way in which he conjures up the alleged division of society in a populist manner is along the lines of the post-factual methods of the US election campaign Merkels finance minister Wolfgang Schuble charged in Der Spiegel last weekIn the dealmaking game that is coalition governments Schulz may have several paths to the chancellery if his party can maintain its momentum It will be difficult analysts say but Schulzs rising popularity means it is no_longer unthinkable that Merkel loses Merkels open-door policy for refugees brought a barrage of criticism from the conservative wing of her party And despite Merkels hesitance Horst Seehofer head of her sister party the Christian Social Union appears to be extending his hand to Trump praising the new presidents consistency and speed in implementing his campaign promisesA Merkel loss could mean a greater frost in German-U S relations harking back to the days of Schrders cool relationship with President George_W Bush Merkel while has nevertheless avoided outright conflict Analysts call that further evidence of her pragmatism and firm belief that Germany needs the United_States diplomatically and for collective defenseGoing after Trump might be a smart strategy for winning elections but not for running a government said Jrgen Falter a political_scientist at

hours later Sen_Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) a frequent critic of the far-right and President Trump who is retiring at the end of this Congress used a floor speech in favor of a conservative judicial nominee to condemn MooreWhen the presidential_nominee of my party the party of Lincoln called for a Muslim ban it was wrong and I said so said Flake When a judge expressed his personal belief that a Muslim should not be a member of Congress because of his faith it was wrong That this same judge is now my partys nominee for the Senate should concern us all Religious tests have no place in the United_States CongressMoores visit came amid an effort by Senate Republicans to criticize Democrats for what they have charged was anti-Catholic animus against judicial nominee Amy Coney Barrett a Catholic law professor who has questioned the legal rationale behind the Supreme_Court ruling on abortion in The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Barrett to serve on the US Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit Republicans have focused on Sen Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif) who accused Barrett at a hearing of letting dogma overwhelm legal reasoning and then expanded to attacking any Democrat who opposed BarrettBut some of the same lawmakers lodging that complaint have not forcefully criticized Moores past comment about Ellison adding awkwardness to their line of attack on the basis of religious libertyFor some Republican senators Moores appearance on Tuesday also created some discomfortAsked whether he supported Moore Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune (SD) responded Im hoping to meet with him while hes up here I havent had a chance to do that yet I dont_know himLike Trump and many other leading Republicans Thune backed Sen Luther Strange in the GOP primary that Moore wonHe stood up and was pleasant in his comments said Sen Bob Corker (R-Tenn) recalling Moores appearance at lunch But Corker wasnt won over and he did_not want to weigh in on Moores controversial positionsI

attend a fundraiser in Washington on Wednesday evening An invitation distributed by his campaign this month lists the names of prominent conservative activists and senators backing his campaign including Sen Mike Lee (R-Utah) But in a sign that Moore may not even be on the same page as some of his allies in Washington a spokesman for Lee said Tuesday that it was not on the senators to-do listTomorrows fundraiser is not on our schedule said the spokesman Conn CarrollThe first criminal_charges stemming from the Russia investigation landed this week at a perilous point in Donald Trumps presidency threatening his standing with foreign leaders ahead of an important trip to Asia on Friday and his effectiveness in selling the Republican tax plan set to be released this weekAides insisted the twin challenges at home and abroad would not be undermined by the indictments but whose job approval ratings hit a new low this week in was evident Tuesday in which he lashed out at the media and Crooked Dems and urged a focus instead on the Massive Tax Cuts he has promised to deliver by ChristmasIn a bid to show he remains focused on the tasks at hand Trump later in the day allowed reporters to witness the start of a at which he boasted that the December signing of the yet-to-be-unveiled GOP tax bill would be the biggest tax event in the history of our countryBut special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_IIIs probe loomed large At the meeting Trump ignored reporters shouted questions related to the charges unveiled Monday against three campaign officials including former campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort and a foreign_policy adviser George_Papadopoulos whom Trump derided on Twitter as a young low_level volunteer and a liar Foreign policy analysts said Trumps political crisis could distract from or complicate his message on a high-stakes 12-day trip to five Asian nations aimed_at building regional support for his bid to pressure North_Korea over its nuclear_weapons and ballistic_missile programsBeyond Trumps tweeting analysts said the issue could dominate the US press corps coverage of the trip with reporters asking him about the Mueller investigation on foreign soilMichael Green an Asia policy aide to President George_W Bush recalled the 43rd president being asked about the Iraq War during trips to Asia even as he attempted to sketch a vision of US engagement in the regionMy prediction is that it will be a story for the White_House press corps and then the Asian press will pick up on it like an echo chamber said Green who was in Japan when news of Muellers indictments broke Monday He added that having been on those trips it can be very very hard for the White_House to get their strategic and foreign_policy message throughTrump plans to visit Japan South_Korea China Vietnam and the Philippines engaging in bilateral meetings with a host of foreign leaders Aides have been briefing him heavilyThe trip comes as Chinese President_Xi Jinping has consolidated power on the heels of the Communist Partys National Congress creating another problematic narrative for TrumpTrump is by far the weakest leader in modern US history and Xi is by far the strongest leader said Ian Bremmer president of the Eurasia Group a global risk assessment firm Thats going to make the meeting uncomfortableBremmer who also was in Japan last_week at a security conference said Japanese officials are concerned that Trump could be motivated to take a more provocative stance on North_Korea or on US trade relations with South_Korea and China to distract from his domestic problemsUnlike past US leaders who have tried to stay on message in Asia while dealing with distractions at home Trump always wants to create a distraction Bremmer said To what extent will he play harder ball with the Chinese or North_Koreans or on trade And most importantly will he decide to really fulminate against the North_Koreans It is dangerous the combination of all thatBonnie Glaser a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International_Studies was in Beijing last weekThe Chinese are worried that his domestic problems will cause Trump to do something internationally that will bolster his domestic position and distract people from his problems at home she saidThe biggest worry is an attack on North_Korea Glaser said Those who think he is not bluffing they think this is something they should be worried aboutIn interviews several prominent Republicans argued that the tax bill will rise or fall based on factors unrelated to Trumps level of distractionHeading into next years midterm elections Republicans in Congress are under tremendous pressure to show they can get something done with control of both chambers and the White HouseThis bill was never going to pass because Donald Trump went up to the Hill and negotiated it said Barry Bennett a GOP consultant who advised Trump during last years general election Its going to pass because Republicans have to pass it Theyre not really counting on much leadership from the presidentA senior Republican congressional aide largely echoed that sentiment and said lawmakers do not expect Trump to have much of an impact in the days following the bills introduction this week and its subsequent markup by the House Ways and Means Committee in a stretch when hell be out of the countryIts kind of an inside-the-cone process said the aide who requested anonymity to speak more candidly Im not sure how_much Trump would make a differenceBut the aide said there will be points later in the process that could benefit from presidential leadership including help selling the legislation to the public before the full House votes and navigating differences that emerge after the Senate passes a billThe aide also said lawmakers have become accustomed to having to navigate distractions created by the White HouseWhen this year have we not had some big story about Russia or something else supposedly looming over us the aide said This is kind of the new normalOther observers suggested the pervasiveness of the Russia probe which continued to dominate cable television news much of Tuesday will have a more significant impact on Capitol_Hill particularly if more indictments are handed down in coming weeksIt brings more chaos into an already chaotic situation where theyre operating on an almost impossible timeline to begin with said Jim Manley a lobbyist and longtime aide to then-Senate Minority Leader Harry M Reid (D-Nev)Manley and others also argued that Trump tends to lash out on Twitter when hes agitated and often not in a helpful wayLast week for instance he tweeted that the tax-cut plan would not include any changes to tax-deferred retirement accounts such as 401(k)s following reports last_week that House Republicans were weighing a sharp reduction in the amount of income American workers could save through such programsWhile they say they would welcome Democratic support leaders of both chambers are preparing to pass the bill with only Republican votes In the Senate where there are 52 Republicans that means the party can lose only two GOP votesThey dont have margin for error so it doesnt take much to get off track said John Weaver who was chief_strategist for the 2016_presidential campaign of Ohio Gov John Kasich (R)Doug Heye a GOP political consultant said the Mueller indictments have largely overshadowed what could have been a string of positive stories about Trumps week his push for tax_cuts the expected announcement of a new Federal_Reserve chairman on Thursday and a major trip abroadThis distraction makes it harder to see any successes they have Heye said It highlights a problem this administration had since the beginning staying out of its own wayRussian government hackers penetrated the computer network of the Democratic_National Committee and gained access to the entire database of opposition_research on GOP presidential_candidate Donald Trump according to committee officials and security experts who responded to the breachThe intruders so thoroughly compromised the DNCs system that they also were able to read all email and chat traffic said DNC officials and the security expertsThe intrusion into the DNC was one of several The networks of presidential candidates Hillary_Clinton and Donald Trump were also targeted by Russian spies as were the computers of some Republican political action committees US officials said But details on those cases were not available I completely rule out a possibility that the [Russian] government or the government bodies have been involved in this Dmitry_Peskov the Kremlins spokesman told the Reuters news_agency in Moscow Some of the hackers had access to the DNC network for about a year but all were expelled over the past weekend in a major computer cleanup campaign the committee officials and experts saidThe DNC said that no financial donor or personal information appears to have been accessed or taken suggesting that the breach was traditional espionage not the work of criminal hackersThe intrusions are an example of Russias interest in the US political system and its desire to understand the policies strengths and weaknesses of a potential future president much as American spies gather similar information on foreign candidates and leadersThe depth of the penetration reflects the skill and determination of the United_States top cyber-adversary as Russia goes after strategic targets from the White_House and State_Department to political campaign organizations Its the job of every foreign intelligence service to collect intelligence against their adversaries said Shawn Henry president of CrowdStrike the cyber firm called in to handle the DNC breach and a former head of the FBIs cyber division He noted that it is extremely difficult for a civilian organization to protect itself from a skilled and determined state such as RussiaWere perceived as an adversary of Russia he said Their job when they wake up every day is to gather intelligence against the policies practices and strategies of the US government There are a variety of ways [Hacking] is one of the more valuable because it gives you a treasure trove of informationRussian President_Vladimir Putin who has called for better relations with Russia and expressed skepticism about NATO But unlike Clinton whom the Russians probably have long had in their spy sights Trump has not been a politician for very long so foreign agencies are playing catch-up analysts sayThe purpose of such intelligence gathering is to understand the targets proclivities said Robert Deitz former senior councillor to the CIA_director and a former general counsel at the National_Security Agency Trumps foreign investments for example would be relevant to understanding how he would deal with countries where he has those investments should he be elected Deitz said They may provide tips for understanding his style of negotiating In short this sort of intelligence could be used by Russia for example to indicate where it can get away with foreign adventurism Other analysts noted that any dirt dug up in opposition_research is likely to be made public anyway Nonetheless DNC leadership acted quickly after the intrusions discovery to contain the damageThe security of our system is critical to our operation and to the confidence of the campaigns and state parties we work with said Rep Debbie_Wasserman Schultz (Fla) the DNC chairwoman When we discovered the intrusion we treated this like the serious incident it is and reached out to CrowdStrike immediately Our team moved as quickly as possible to kick out the intruders and secure our network Clinton called the intrusion troubling in an_interview with Telemundo She also said So far as we know my campaign has not been hacked into and added that cybersecurity is an issue that she will be absolutely focused on if she becomes president Because whether its Russia or China Iran or North_Korea more and more countries are using hacking to steal our information to use it to their advantage she said A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign referred questions to the Secret ServiceDNC leaders were tipped to the hack in late April Chief executive Amy Dacey got a call from her operations chief saying that their information technology team had noticed some unusual network activityIts never a call any executive wants to get but the IT team knew something was awry Dacey said And they knew it was serious enough that they wanted experts to investigateThat evening she spoke with Michael Sussmann a DNC lawyer who is a partner with Perkins_Coie in Washington Soon after Sussmann a former federal_prosecutor who handled computer crime cases called Henry whom he has known for many yearsWithin 24 hours CrowdStrike had installed software on the DNCs computers so that it could analyze data that could indicate who had gained access when and howThe firm identified two separate hacker groups both working for the Russian_government that had infiltrated the network said Dmitri Alperovitch CrowdStrike co-founder and chief technology officer The firm had analyzed other breaches by both groups over the past two years One group which CrowdStrike had dubbed Cozy Bear had gained access last_summer and was monitoring the DNCs email and chat communications Alperovitch saidThe other which the firm had named Fancy Bear broke into the network in late April and targeted the opposition_research files It was this breach that set off the alarm The hackers stole two files Henry said And they had access to the computers of the entire research staff an average of about several dozen on any given dayThe computers contained research going back years on Trump Its a huge job to dig into the dealings of somebody who has never run for office before Dacey saidCrowdStrike is not sure how the hackers got in The firm suspects they may have targeted DNC employees with spearphishing emails These are communications that appear legitimate often made to look like they came from a colleague or someone trusted but that contain links or attachments that when clicked on deploy malicious software that enables a hacker to gain access to a computer But we dont have hard evidence Alperovitch saidThe two groups did_not appear to be working together Alperovitch said Fancy Bear is believed to work for the GRU or Russias military intelligence service he said CrowdStrike is less sure of whom Cozy Bear works for but thinks it might be the Federal Security Service or FSB the countrys powerful security agency which was once headed by Putin The lack of coordination is not unusual he said Theres an amazing adversarial relationship among the Russian intelligence_agencies Alperovitch said We have seen them steal assets from one another refuse to collaborate Theyre all vying for power to sell Putin on how good they areThe two crews have superb operational tradecraft he said They often use previously unknown software bugs known as zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise applications In the DNCs case the hackers constantly switched tactics to maintain a stealthy presence inside the network and used built-in Windows tools so that they didnt have to resort to malicious code that might trigger alerts They flew under the radar Alperovitch saidThe two groups have hacked government agencies tech companies defense contractors energy and manufacturing firms and universities in the United_States Canada and Europe as well as in Asia he saidCozy Bear for instance compromised the unclassified email systems of the White_House State_Department and Joint_Chiefs of Staff in 2014 Alperovitch saidThis is a sophisticated foreign intelligence service with a lot of time a lot of resources and is interested in targeting the US political system Henry said He said the DNC was not engaged in a fair fight Youve got ordinary citizens who are doing hand-to-hand combat with trained military officers he said And thats an untenable situationRussia has always been a formidable foe in cyberspace but in the past two years theres been a thousand-fold increase in its espionage campaign against the West said Alperovitch who is also a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council They feel under siegeWestern sanctions_imposed after Russias annexation of Crimea in Ukraine have hurt the economy and led the government to increase its theft of intellectual property to limit the impact of import restrictions he said And Russias growing isolation has increased the need for intelligence to understand and influence political decisions in other countries he addedCrowdStrike is continuing the forensic investigation said Sussmann the DNC lawyer But at this time it appears that no financial information or sensitive employee donor or voter information was accessed by the Russian attackers he saidThe firm has installed special software on every computer and server in the network to detect any efforts by the Russian cyberspies to break in again When they get kicked out of the system Henry predicted

protecting gay rights could lead to the legalization of pedophilia In every aspect Clovis falls far short of the standards demanded by the position the Union of Concerned Scientists wrote in a one-page to the committees chairman Sen Pat Roberts (R-Kan) and the panels top Democrat Sen Debbie Stabenow (Mich) The letter had 3100 signers Mike Lavender senior Washington representative for the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists said in a statement that emerging evidence of Clovis potential involvement with the Trump campaigns Russian connections should be the final nail in the coffin for his confirmationThe Center for Science in the Public Interest sent the committee a similar letter Tuesday A lawyer for Clovis who is currently a senior White_House adviser to the Agriculture Department did_not respond to a request for commentThe new round of opposition came after Clovis was identified as by foreign_policy adviser George_Papadopoulos to broker a relationship with Russian officials Court documents unsealed_Monday revealed that Papadopoulos in early October to making false statement to FBI investigators about his contacts with foreigners

from Iowa Clovis is likely to face questions about his interactions with Papadopoulos during his Senate hearing which had been tentatively scheduled for Nov9The emerging information about his role in the Trump campaigns interactions with Russia raises serious concerns Stabenow said in a statement As we consider his nomination I will be looking into these facts along with his questionable qualifications and long history of divisive and outrageous statementsRoberts spokeswoman Meghan Cline declined to comment on the opposition to Clovis saying that we are working on scheduling details and will announce a date for a nominations hearing soonA former economics professor at Morningside College in Iowa Clovis made an unsuccessful run for the US Senate in 2014 He served as one of Trumps first campaign policy advisers In a 2014 interview with Iowa Public Radio he said he was extremely skeptical about climate_change Clovis took a leave of absence from his position at Morningside

investigation_into Russia meddling in the 2016 electionMy basic philosophy is once you have an independent counsel you ought to give him a chance to follow the facts said Sen_Richard C Shelby (R-Ala) a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the chairman of the subcommittee that handles the Justice_Departments funding If somebodys doing a job you dont_want to cut it offI would not support that He needs to continue to investigate said Sen_Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) who last_week excoriated Trumps governing style in a speech announcing plans to retire at the end of next yearI would oppose said Sen John_McCain (R-Ariz) one of the presidents most vocal critics in Congress And so would the American peopleThose voices and others reflect an emerging Republican message for dealing with the Mueller investigation Stay away from it and warn Trump to do the same There would be an uprising at the Capitol like never seen before if any kind of interference looked like it was taking place said Sen Bob Corker (R-Tenn) Regardless of which side of the aisle Thats just beyond the paleThose reactions came amid evidence that some Republican lawmakers would like to curtail or at_least redirect the ongoing investigations into Russian_interference including several congressional inquiries Some Republican senators and House members for instance have heeded the presidents call in recent_weeks to launching new inquiries into a uranium_deal with Russia that President_Barack Obamas administration approved in 2010 Trump used the uranium_deal as a political cudgel against Hillary_Clinton on the campaign_trail despite scant evidence she had personally played a role in the decision At least three congressional_committees in the House and Senate are also continuing to look into how the Federal Bureau of Investigation handled Clintons email scandalBut even those Republicans calling for more attention to those new probes dont_want to touch Muellers fundsI dont_want to deny the Justice_Department or special_counsel resources they need said Senate_Judiciary Committee member John Kennedy (R-La) just moments after telling reporters he believed the uranium probes deserved more attention Now I dont_want to see them just go hog wild and waste money either But I dont_want to try to do anything to hurt their effortCorker said there was no talk about the Mueller investigation at Tuesdays weekly GOP policy luncheon Most Republican lawmakers said they dont believe that Trump will fire Mueller or defund or otherwise upend his investigationThe idea that Bob Mueller is going to have the scope of his inquiry constrained or be otherwise restricted is really out there said Sen Susan Collins (R-Maine) I_think thats extremely unlikelySo long as there are no signs that will change Republican leaders will_continue trying to keep their focus on the legislative agenda which at the moment is all about tax reform In the Senate GOP leaders are also aiming to confirm a slate of judicial nominees a top priority for many conservative activists The special_counsel has his job to do The job we have here in the Senate is the investigation being carried_out by the intelligence committee said Senate Majority_Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) in his first public comments since the first charges from Muellers inquiry were recently revealed One Republican in frequent contact with GOP lawmakers said Tuesday that there was an emerging consensus among them that the only way to head off a bloodbath in next years midterm elections is to pass a tax bill So they are trying to keep all their energy on that goal and shut out most everything else I_think all these guys are running for their political lives said the Republican who was granted anonymity to speak candidly Still some are raising alarm bells about Muellers findings I guarantee you more shoes will drop said McCain He added later I guarantee you the scandals not over Paul Kane contributed to this reportRussias ambassador to Washington told his superiors in Moscow that he discussed campaign-related matters including policy issues important to Moscow with Jeff_Sessions during the 2016_presidential race contrary to public assertions by the embattled attorney_general according to current and former US officialsAmbassador Sergey Kislyaks accounts of two conversations with Sessions then a top foreign_policy adviser to Republican candidate Donald Trump were intercepted by US spy_agencies which monitor the communications of senior Russian officials in the United_States and in Russia Sessions initially failed to disclose his contacts with Kislyak and then said that the meetings were not about the Trump campaignOne US official said that Sessions who testified that he had no recollection of an April encounter has provided misleading statements that are contradicted by other evidence A former official said that the intelligence indicates that Sessions and Kislyak had substantive discussions on matters including Trumps positions on Russia-related issues and prospects for US-Russia relations in a Trump administrationSessions has said repeatedly that he never discussed campaign-related issues with Russian officials and that it was only in his capacity as a US senator that he met with KislyakI never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign when he announced that he would recuse_himself from matters relating to the FBI probe of Russian_interference in the election and any connections to the Trump campaign Current and former US officials said that that assertion is at odds with Kislyaks accounts of conversations in two encounters during the campaign one in April ahead of Trumps first major foreign_policy speech and another in July on the sidelines of the Republican_National ConventionThe apparent discrepancy could pose new problems for Sessions as his position in the administration appears increasingly tenuousTrump expressed frustration with Sessionss recusing himself from the Russia probe and indicated regret at making the lawmaker from Alabama the nations top law_enforcement officer Trump also faulted Sessions as giving bad answers during his confirmation_hearing about his Russia contacts during the campaignOfficials emphasized that the information contradicting Sessions comes from US intelligence on Kislyaks communications with the Kremlin and they acknowledged that the Russian_ambassador could have mischaracterized or exaggerated the nature of his interactionsObviously I cannot comment on the reliability of what anonymous sources describe in a wholly uncorroborated intelligence intercept that the Washington_Post has not seen and that has not been provided to me said a Justice_Department spokeswoman_Sarah Isgur_Flores in a statement She reasserted that Sessions did_not discuss interference in the electionRussian and other foreign diplomats in Washington and elsewhere have been known at times to report false or misleading information to bolster their standing with their superiors or to confuse US intelligence agenciesBut US officials with regular access to Russian intelligence reports say Kislyak whose tenure as ambassador to the United_States ended recently was known for accurately relaying details about his interactions with officials in WashingtonSessions removed himself from direct involvement in the Russia investigation after it was revealed in The Washington_Post that he had met with Kislyak at_least twice in 2016 contacts he failed to disclose during his confirmation_hearing in JanuaryI did_not have communications with the Russians Sessions said when asked whether anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign had communicated with representatives of the Russian governmentHe has since maintained that he misunderstood the scope of the question and that his meetings with Kislyak were strictly in his capacity as a US senator In a March appearance on Fox television Sessions said I dont recall any discussion of the campaign in any significant waySessions appeared to narrow that assertion further saying that he never_met with or had any conversation with any Russians or foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United StatesBut when pressed for details during that hearing Sessions qualified many of his answers by saying that he could not recall or did_not have any recollectionA former US official who read the Kislyak reports said that the Russian_ambassador reported speaking with Sessions about issues that were central to the campaign including Trumps positions on key policy matters of significance to MoscowSessions had a third meeting with Kislyak in his Senate office in September Officials declined to say whether US intelligence_agencies intercepted any Russian communications describing the third encounterAs a result the discrepancies center on two earlier Sessions-Kislyak conversations including one that Sessions has acknowledged took_place in July 2016 on the sidelines of the Republican_National ConventionBy that point Russian President_Vladimir Putin had decided to embark on a secret campaign to help Trump win the White_House by leaking damaging emails about Trumps rival Democrat Hillary_Clinton according to US intelligence agenciesAlthough it remains unclear how involved Kislyak was in the covert Russian campaign to aid Trump his superiors in Moscow were eager for updates about the candidates positions particularly regarding US sanctions on Russia and long-standing disputes with the Obama_administration over conflicts in Ukraine and SyriaKislyak also reported having a conversation with Sessions in April_2016 at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington where then-candidate Trump delivered his first major foreign_policy address according to the officials familiar_with intelligence on KislyakSessions has said he does_not remember any encounter with Kislyak at that event In his June testimony before the Senate_Intelligence Committee Sessions said I do not recall any conversations with any Russian official at the Mayflower HotelLater in that hearing Sessions said that its conceivable that that occurred I just dont remember itKislyak also was a key figure in who was forced to leave that job after The_Post revealed that he had discussed US sanctions against Russia with Kislyak even while telling others in the Trump administration that he had not done soIn that case however Flynns phone conversations with Kislyak were intercepted by US intelligence providing irrefutable evidence The intelligence on Sessions by contrast is based on Kislyaks accounts and not corroborated by other sourcesFormer FBI_director James_B Comey fueled speculation about the possibility of a Sessions-Kislyak meeting at the Mayflower when he told the same Senate committee on June8 that the FBI had information about Sessions that would have made it problematic for him to be involved in overseeing the Russia probeComey would not provide details of what information the FBI had except to say that he could discuss it only privately with the senators Current and former officials said he appeared to be alluding to intelligence on Kislyaks account of an encounter with Sessions at the MayflowerSenate Democrats later called on the FBI to investigate the event in April at the Mayflower hotelSessionss role in removing Comey as FBI_director angered many at the bureau and set in motion

Russian_ambassador proved to be improper or suspect he too would join the call for Sessions to recuse_himself from the investigationIf there is something there and it goes up the chain of investigation it is clear to me that Jeff_Sessions who is my dear friend cannot make that decision about Trump Graham said although he stressed that Sessionss contacts with the Russian_ambassador could have been innocentBut if theres something there that the FBI thinks is criminal in nature then for sure you need a special prosecutor If that day ever comes Ill be the first one to say it needs to be somebody other than Jeff Current and former US officials say they see Kislyak as a diplomat not an intelligence operative But they were not sure to what extent if any Kislyak was aware of or involved in the covert Russian election campaignSteven Hall former head of Russia operations at the CIA said that Russia would have been keenly interested in cultivating a relationship with Sessions because of his role on key congressional_committees and as an early adviser to TrumpSessionss membership on the Armed_Services Committee would have made him a priority for the Russian_ambassador The fact that he had already placed himself at_least ideologically behind Trump would have been an added bonus for Kislyak Hall saidMichael McFaul a Stanford University professor who until 2014 served as US ambassador to Russia said he was not surprised that Kislyak would seek a meeting with Sessions The weird part is to conceal it he said That was at the height of all the discussions of what Russia was doing during the electionTwo months before the September meeting Sessions attended a Heritage_Foundation event in July on the sidelines of the Republican_National Convention that was attended by about 50 ambassadors When the event was over a small_group of ambassadors approached Sessions as he was leaving the podium and Kislyak was among them the Justice_Department official said Sessions then spoke individually to some of the ambassadors including Kislyak the official said In the informal exchanges the ambassadors expressed appreciation for his remarks and some of them invited him to events they were sponsoring said the official citing a former Sessions staffer who was at the eventDemocratic lawmakers including senior members of the Senate_Judiciary Committee have demanded in recent_weeks that Sessions recuse_himself from the governments inquiry into possible ties_between Trump associates and RussiaLast week Rep Darrell Issa (R-Calif) a senior member of the House Judiciary_Committee became one of the few Republican representatives to state publicly the need for an independent investigationSessionss public position on Russia has evolved over timeIn an on the sidelines of the German Marshall Funds Brussels Forum in March 2015 Sessions said the United_States and Europe have to unify against RussiaMore than a year later he spoke about fostering a stronger relationship with the Kremlin In a July 2016 State of the Union Sessions praised Trumps plan to build better relations with Russian President_Vladimir PutinDonald Trump is right We_need to figure out a way to end this cycle of hostility thats putting this country at risk costing us billions of dollars in defense and creating hostilities Sessions told CNNAsked whether he viewed Putin as a good or bad leader Sessions told CNN We have a lot of bad leaders around the world that operate in ways we would never tolerate in the United_States But the question is can we have a more peaceful effective relationship with Russia Utilizing interests that are similar in a realistic way to make this world a safer place and get off this dangerous hostility with Russia I_think its possible Julie_Tate

Compound in Massachusetts during his tenure Preferring warmer weather Harry S Truman often stayed at a place that came to be known as the Little White_House in Florida Throughout history US presidents have found ways to get away from Washington thats nothing newWhat is new though is scale President Trump in Florida has a triplex penthouse in Trump_Tower in downtown Manhattan and has his last name emblazoned on dozens of properties around the worldWhat does it take to secure these properties And if Trump continues to retreat to Mar-a-Lago with some regularity whats the cost to the American

capabilityWeve carried_out a hydrogen_bomb test a newsreader on the state-run_Korean Central Television station announced in a special broadcast from PyongyangNorth Korea was forced to develop its nuclear arsenal because of the USs hostile policy against North_Korea she said There was some skepticism about the claim with nuclear experts noting that the yield appeared to be similar to North_Koreas three previous atomic tests rather_than the enormous yield that would be expected if it had been a thermonuclear testWe are aware of seismic activity on the Korean_Peninsula in the vicinity of a known North_Korean nuclear_test site and have seen Pyongyangs claims of a nuclear_test said John Kirby a spokesman at the State_Department We are monitoring and continuing to assess the situation in close coordination with our regional partnersEither way Pyongyangs provocative action will present a new challenge to the outside_world which has struggled to find ways to end North_Koreas nuclear defianceNorth Koreas fourth test in the context of repeated statements by US Chinese and South_Korean leaders throws down the gauntlet to the international_community to go beyond paper resolutions and find a way to impose real costs on North_Korea for pursuing this course of action said Scott Snyder a Korea expert at the Council on Foreign RelationsKim Jong_Uns regime to defend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nation Some analysts were doubtful saying the young leader appeared primarily concerned with trying to bolster his legitimacyBut on Wednesday North_Korea said in a special broadcast that it had carried_out a successful hydrogen_bomb test With this hydrogen_bomb test we have joined the major nuclear powers the newsreader saidHydrogen or thermonuclear bombs are exponentially more powerful and destructive than atomic devices An atomic bomb uses fission to break up the atomic nucleus and release energy while a hydrogen or thermonuclear bomb uses fusion to add to the nucleus This leads to an enormous explosion resulting from an uncontrolled self-sustaining chain reactionKim has repeatedly asserted and has resolutely refused to return to multilateral talks North_Korea had conducted three nuclear_tests since 2006 but only one during Kims reign in February 2013 Then there were signs of unusual seismic activity around North_Koreas main nuclear_test site Wednesday morning sparking fears that Pyongyang ordered the detonation of another atomic device two days before Kims birthdayWe have consistently made clear that we will not accept [North Korea] as a nuclear state Kirby said We will_continue to protect and defend our allies in the region including the Republic of Korea and will respond appropriately to any and all North_Korean provocationsEarthquake agencies in China Japan and the United_States all recorded unusual seismic activity in the northeastern corner of North_Korea at 10am local time WednesdayThe US Geological Survey recorded a shallow 51-magnitude quake about 20 miles from the facility at Punggye-ri where North_Korea has carried_out its three previous nuclear_tests Many analysts have been surprised that such a long period has passed without another test because it is by testing that North_Korea can advance its programI think they have a technological path in mind said Jeffrey_Lewis a nuclear expert at the Middlebury_Institute of International_Studies in Monterey CalifIn December Lewis noted that satellite pictures showed North_Korea appeared to be at its nuclear_test site warning that the Pyongyang regime might be preparing to conduct a fourth atomic test There is a lot of tunneling at the test_site which could mean they have a bunch of tests planned he saidAlthough analysts were still awaiting more data Lewis said that Wednesdays explosion looked very similar to past tests and was not enormous suggesting it was not a hydrogen bombIn Seoul and Tokyo the governments called emergency national_security meetings to discuss the possibility of a nuclear testThis nuclear_test by North_Korea is a major threat to our countrys security and I absolutely cannot accept it Japanese_Prime Minister_Shinzo Abe told_reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday Also it is clearly a violation of United_Nations Security_Council resolutions so we will take strong measure including steps within the UN_Security CouncilJoel Wit a former US diplomat who runs the 38 North website dedicated to North_Korea said that the purpose of the test remained unclearWhat is clear is that North_Korea is moving forward with its nuclear_weapons program and that the United_States China and the international_community need to come up with more effective ways to deal with this growing threat he said Yoonjung_Seo

gravely concerned about the quality of care at UMC said council member Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) pointing to the details of Webbs_death What is described is shocking for a health-care facility and simply unacceptableCouncil member Vincent Gray (D-Ward 7) the health committees chairman said he was worried that UMCs management was not being held accountable because the hospital serves a poor and heavily Medicaid-reliant group of patients in Southeast Washington Veritass performance at UMC would never be tolerated anywhere else in the city not for six_months not for a single second Gray saidThe hospital has come under increasing scrutiny since early August when city health regulators abruptly closed its obstetrics_ward without explaining whyThe Post later reported that the closure came because of that included a failure to take measures to prevent the transmission of HIV to a newborn and inadequate screening and treatment for a pregnant woman with a history of potentially fatal blood-pressure problemsVeritas is owned by Chrystie_Boucre wife of Corbett Price whom Bowser appointed in 2015 to the board of the Metro transportation system Price his relatives and his companies

said Veritas is coming up with plans to reopen the obstetrics_ward which would ultimately have to be approved by the hospital board He also pointed to a prospective contract for a doctors group associated with George Washington University to take over UMCs emergency roomHowever he cautioned that both initiatives might require a taxpayer subsidy a move that the mayor has said she wants to avoidDavid Boucre recently took over the helm of UMC after that the prior chief_executive Luis Hernandez would be moved to a new position at the hospitalA search for a permanent replacement for Hernandez is underway But council members repeatedly questioned Boucre about whether he is qualified to run UMC in the meantimeBoucre who told The_Post in August that his professional background is in information technology and outsourcing said he had not explicitly run a hospital before but had managed many large and complex organizationsHe cited his work for companies including Lockheed Martin and Inovalon a health-care data analytics company All the efforts that I have done throughout my career have been industry-agnostic he saidAfter a year of frosty diplomacy and economic pressure South_Korea and China announced Tuesday that they would put aside their differences out of a joint desire to denuclearize the Korean PeninsulaSouth Koreas Foreign_Ministry said the two countries will resume normal relations The two sides attach great importance to the Korea-China relationship a statement from the ministry saidIn its own coordinated statementChinas Foreign_Ministry said the two nations would work to put their relationship back on a normal trackas soon as possibleChina and South_Korea have historically deep ties and over the past few decades had enjoyed a close relationship However that relationship was deeply damaged last July when Seoul agreed to install the US-owned Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defense_(THAAD) missile_defense platform on its landThough both Seoul and Washington argued the THAAD_system had only defensive capabilities Beijing was concerned about US encirclement as well as the systems sophisticated radar capabilitiesChinese President_Xi Jinping was also angered that former South_Korean president Park_Geun-hye had sided with American interests over China said Yun Suna senior associate with the East_Asia Program at the Stimson CenterXi had tried to sway South_Koreas alignment choice and when Park rejected Chinas demand not to deploy THAAD it made Xis great diplomacy on South_Korea a failure and an embarrassment Sun said in an email this weekendWhen the missile system was deployed earlier_this year Chinas Foreign_Ministry spokesman_Geng Shuang warned that Beijing would resolutely take necessary measures to defend our security interestsSouth Koreas Foreign_Ministry acknowledged that the THAAD dispute had not been fully resolvedThe two sides agreed to engage in communication on THAAD-related issues about which the Chinese side is concerned through communication between their military authorities it said in a statementFor its part China confirmed Tuesday that its position on THAAD had not changedAnd on Sunday South_Koreas military chief met with his American and Japanese counterparts as part of a growing three-way dialogueChina is South_Koreas largest trading partner and it used this economic clout to punish Korean businesses when the antimissile_system was deployed Trips by Chinese tour groups to South_Korea were suspended with the number of Chinese visitors dropping 60percent in the first nine months of the year compared with 2016 according to figures released by the Bank of KoreaKorean-owned businesses also suffered boycotts and bans in China The situation was especially difficult for the Lotte conglomerate which had allowed its land to be used for the installation of the THAAD_system Last month it announced it would be selling off its supermarkets in China after most were shut_down for fire code violations and other alleged infractionsPresident Moon Jae-ins new South_Korean government had recently made a number of moves to ease Chinas anxiety over THAAD withForeign Minister Kang Kyung-wha announcing last_week that South_Korea would not seek any more deployments of the system The moves had been received warmly in Chinas state-run press with the nationalist saying that theproactive stance of Moons government wasa new gesture that is welcomedChoi Kang vice_president of the Seoul think_tank Asan Institute for Policy Studies said that South_Korea had not offered any real concessions on the issueSince South_Korea has maintained a very firm position on THAAD the Chinese side decided to move instead Kang saidInstead North_Korea and other factors may have led to the agreement between the two nations which came after the Chinese Party Congress that saw Xi consolidate his power over the country and exactly a week before President Trump arrives in South_Korea as part of a 12-day Asia tripChina is keen to restart relations with South_Korea under Moon said Sun as he has signaled that he is seeking an independent policy and is open to talks with North_Korea a long-standing ally of BeijingWhen the relationship with President Park was beyond repair for China Moon gives China new hope Sun wrote However Kang said that the two sides still had different outlooks on the region that could lead to more disputes China and South_Korea felt the necessity to manage their bilateral relations for different reasons not for common objectives and concerns Kang saidThe conflict is not over yetNorth Koreas provocations have prompted other shifts in the Pacific as well In one example the senior military officials from the United_States South_Korea and Japan are incrementally increasing collective ballistic_missile defense despite strained relations between South_Korea and Japan that date back to Japans invasion of the Korean_Peninsula during World_War IIOn

five times since July 2014 in three-party talks with Dunford and his predecessor Army Gen Martin E Dempsey On Sunday the agreed to hold quarterly missile_defense exercises in 2018 Dunford saidDunford said that the discussions between South_Korea and Japan are important for a couple of reasons Number one from a deterrence perspective its important that Kim_Jong Un and [North Korea] see that they are facing a collective response from the international_community and in particular those nations most affected Dunford said And number two if we do have to respond Japan is a critical ally that the United_States is going to need to meet its alliance commitments We have over 50000 forces in Japan It is a platform from which we would project power in any South_Korean response Simon Denyer in

continuously violated the law and the constitutionThe court concluded that the president had helped her friend Choi_Soon-sil extract bribes from South_Korean conglomerates The negative impact of the presidents legal violations is serious andthe benefits to defending the constitution by dismissing her from office are overwhelmingly large the acting chief justice said in reading out the courts

ofdonations and the sharing of state secrets Park had immunity from prosecution while she was in office but has lost that now that she has been removed from the presidencyThe release of the

an unequivocal warning to the people in power not to take_advantage of their positions and seek personal gains Park was suspended from office in December after weeks of enormous protests with hundreds of thousands of people packing the streets of Seoul every Saturdaycalling on her to resign or be impeachedThe outrage against her was triggered by revelations that thepresident who seldom consulted with her ministers and official advisers had been taking secret counsel on everything from North_Korea policy to her wardrobe choices from a friend who held no official positionMaking matters worse it

usual caution to warn in uncharacteristically blunt terms that her government will do all it can to punish Pyongyang for Talk of the Norths collapse is normally a no-go topic here because the prospect not only alarms South Koreans but also enrages Kim_Jong Uns irascible regime But following the Norths nuclear and missile_tests this year Park is taking a markedly more confrontational approachDear people of South_Korea its obvious now that our previous methods and goodwill cannot break Pyongyangs nuclear will she said in a special televised address to the National Assembly I believe we should not provide them with unconditional support anymore or succumb to their provocations We now need to find a fundamental solution to effectively change North_Korea and it is our time to be brave Her tough words come at a time when South_Korea Japan and the United_States are in unusual accord on how to deal with North_Korea Her address also coincides with a buildup in US military muscle on the Korean_Peninsula Four US F-22 stealth fighter jets are set to arrive in the South on Wednesday while the USS John C Stennis aircraft carrier is due later in the month ahead of joint military exercisesPark has pursued what she calls a trustpolitik approach to North_Korea trying to build trust without weakening deterrence But last_week she signaled a significant shift when she ordered the shutdown of the inter-Korean industrial zone at Kaesong on the northern side of the demilitarized zone that separates the two countries where about 54000 North_Koreans worked in 124 South Korean-owned factories had long been kept separate from politics it was not shuttered even after a North_Korean attack on a South_Korean naval corvette in 2010 that killed 46 South_Korean sailorsBut Park citing estimates that the Souths government and private enterprises have contributed $3billion to the Norths government over the past 20 years including through the Kaesong project has pulled the plugThe shutdown was just the start she said Tuesday From now on the government will start taking stronger and more effective measures to push North_Korea to make changes by creating an environment in which the North will realize that nuclear development is not a way to ensure its survival but a way to ensure the quick collapse of the regime she saidParks comments including the mention of the Norths collapse took many analysts by surpriseShe has announced a real change in her policy said Choi Kang vice_president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies a Seoul think_tank She didnt say regime change but it seems that she has something like that in mindThere are few economic avenues left for the South to punish the North The Kumgang tourist area where South Koreans could visit a North_Korean mountain range in a project that generated foreign currency for the Kim regime was shut_down years_ago after a South_Korean woman was shot by a North_Korean guard put in place after the 2010 naval attack also curbed economic cooperation and tradeBut there is plenty that South_Korea could do militarily Choi said including beefing up the capabilities of its armed_forces continuing to blare anti-Kim messages across the DMZ and perhaps even cutting off humanitarian aidThe Souths recent actions especially the loudspeaker messages have infuriated the North In a statement last_week after the Kaesong shutdown the Norths official Korean_Central News_Agency labeled Park a confrontational wicked woman operating at the groin of her American bossPyongyang also has been sending anti-South leaflets over the DMZ with balloons Some that landed north of Seoul on Tuesday according to local media featured a caricature of Park and warned of divine vengeance for what it said were her failures including the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking in which hundreds died the high suicide rate and a MERS outbreak The leaflet featured death portraits of Parks mother who was shot by a North_Korean

five_years and then act like youre correcting everybody else Were not crazy We were there We all saw you do it Even the people who support you saw you do it Its why they support youLate-night comics have been going after Donald Trump since he was merely billionaire Donald Trump and not yet President Trump But a parody on Stephen Colberts Late_Show captured the weirdness of Trumps tumultuous first month in office by invoking the name of a historic movie villain Keyser SzeIt happened Wednesday_night when Colbert sporting a fake widows peak inserted himself into the final scene of The Usual SuspectsThe 1995 movies antagonist is a shadowy crime kingpin who subtly pulls the strings of the criminal underworld Every criminal knows Keyser Sze and fears him even_though no one has met him and he may not technically existThe movie rocketed Kevin_Spacey to an Academy Award and in the last two_decades Keyser Sze has taken on a pop culture life of his own a personification of the powerful (and

spilling coffeeOn the bottom of the shattered pieces Trump/Putin 2016Stephen Colbert dropped the L word (lie) and the F word (you know) on the Trump White_House on Monday_night It was the late-night comedians latest blast of politically charged commentary primarily directed at the 45th president And it was the kind of performance that just a short time ago seemed to risk alienating large numbers of potential viewers but now appears to be making the Late_Show host a very big drawColbert lampooned White_House senior policy_adviser Stephen Miller who on his tour of the Sunday political talk shows assertedthat the powers of the president to protect our_country are very substantial and will not be questionedWill not be questioned Let_me test that theory Colbert said What the f--- are you talking aboutColbert then challenged Miller who said he is prepared to go on any show anytime anywhere to appear on Tuesdays Late ShowListen if you dont show up Im_going to call you a liar Colbert said And if you do show up Im_going to call you a liar to your faceMiller did_not showWith forceful remarks like this Colbert on late-night king Jimmy Fallon who is far_less inclined to take on the president in a harsh mannerConventional wisdom is that Fallons approach works best on a major broadcast network When the of late-night viewers in the fall of 2015 shortly_after Colberts debut on CBS it found that Fallon appealed to people across the political spectrum The Tonight Show hosts audience was 36 percent Democrat 31 percent Republican and 27 percent independentColberts audience skewed sharply to the left 47 percent Democrat 17 percent Republican and 31 percent independentA liberal slanthelped make Colbert a star on Comedy Central but CBS executives made it clear that they expected Mr Colbert to broaden his appeal when he moved to the medium of late night on a network the at the time of his hiringColbert however was among Trumps during the campaign and never really moderated his politics Ratings throughout his first year on the Late_Show were much to the delight of conservative publications such as the Weekly Standard which Colberts early struggles sweet schadenfreudeAbsent another survey of late-night audiences it is unclear what exactly has reversed Colberts fortunes Are liberal viewers tuning in in greater numbers Or is Colbert bringing in conservatives who were uncomfortable with Trump during the campaign and who feel unnerved by his fledgling administrationIt is worth noting that Colberts skewering of Miller on Monday_night had little to do with liberal or

President Trumps thoughts were elsewhere judging from his Twitter feed He belted out a series of unsupported (and occasionally misspelled) claims about his predecessor saying the Obama_administration tapped phones in Trump_Tower during the electionHow low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process he said This is Nixon/Watergate Bad (or_sick) guyIs it legal

Justice_Department to publicly reject Trumps assertions about phone tapping Mr Comey has argued that the highly charged claim is false and must be corrected the Times wrote calling the request a remarkable rebuke of a sitting president putting the nations top law_enforcement official in the position of questioning Mr Trumps truthfulnessIn 1973attorney John Dean sat before the Senate Watergate Committee and recounted the grimy details of the scandal that brought Richard Nixons presidency to a prematureendDean ultimately pored over 600 hours of secretly recorded White_House tapes and admitted he had been involved in strategic conversations about illegal activityDuring the final months of Nixons presidency Dean testified against the commander in chief words that helped end a presidency Dean was granted immunity for his testimony but still landed Now 44 years later the man who experienced presidential scandalup close says he has a case of deja vuDean said in an_interview aired Friday that President Trumps first month in office with its anti-media tirades and efforts to use intelligence_agencies for political purposes has echoes of WatergateI have expertise on this matter Push back on an FBI investigation of the White_House is better known as a COVER UP John Dean (@JohnWDean) What I see and hear are echoes of Watergate he said in theWe dont have Watergate 20 yet but what we have is something that is beginning to look like it could go thereDean is no stranger to criticizing presidents He has been And he has said that PresidentGeorge W_Bush should have been impeached In fact the title of Deans 2004 book is But Dean saidhe sees a Nixonian patina in how Trumps administration has tried to get the US intelligence_community to play down alleged tieswith RussiaThis week several news agencies reported that the administration askedsenior members of the intelligence_community to counter stories about Trump associates ties to Russia the calls were made after FBI officials refused to do thatDean isnt the only Trump critic who has made this comparisonEvery time you think the Trump Administration could be semi-normal theres something like this and it feels like Nixon 73 all over again Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) A reminder for Trump Nixon also tried to stop an FBI investigation He found out no president is above the law Jim McGovern (@RepMcGovern) Four decades ago as the Watergate scandal swirled Dean said Nixons White_House behaved in a similar fashion trying to use the CIA to cut_off the FBI investigationAsdetails of Nixons interactions with intelligence officials seeped out Dean said the president tried to cover up what_happened which caused even more damageWhat it did is it caught Richard Nixon in a lie because he had denied he had known anything about any cover up until I told him much later when I started having direct dealings with him Dean said And it was the lie that caught him more_than that particular incidentDean also said Trumps sour opinion of the media rivalsNixonsThey just screw it up They screw it all up In approach execution They screw it up Richard M Nixon (@dick_nixon) There is one key difference Nixon mostly kept his views private Trumps disdain is very public In a sprawling news_conference last_week for example Trump bashed the mediaAs The Posts on Thursdays news_conference Trump repeatedly lambasted the fake_news media which at one point he upgraded (or downgraded) to the very fake_news media while promoting some dubious claims and they reported The media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges we made and theyre not happy about it for whatever reason Trump said at Thursdays news conferenceDean said Nixon made those kind of comments that we only know about because he had his secret taping system running and seemed to forget it was on just constantly when he was in the officeIt would automatically go on And hed make those kind of attacks against the media calling the media the enemy saying that he was going to wiretap them and surveil them to find out who was leakingIn his interview Dean delves into a bigger question If Trumphas so many parallels with Nixon will his presidency end in similar fashionThe House and Senate are controlled by the Republicans theyre not going to impeach their president he said As long as he gives them what they want and signs into legislation or signs into law a lot of the things that theyve had in their dreams for many years theyre not going to give him any problem Impeachment is not a legal process Its a quasi-legal process but its primarily a political process And were not there yetAs a service to readers bound to be confused by an increasinglycomplex story heres a brief guide to the latest developments in the tangled allegations involving Russia President Trump and Hillary_Clinton The dossier is concerning President Trump and Russia written by Christopher_Steele a former_British intelligence_officer between June 20 and Dec 13 2016 Steele produced his memos under a contract with Fusion_GPS The memos are based on interviews Steele had with unidentified Russian sources (identified for instance as Kremlin insider) some of whom he paid for information Raw intelligence is essentially high-grade gossip without the expectation it would be made public unless it is further verifiedThe memos among other things allege the Russian_government had been seeking to split the Western alliance by cultivating and supporting Trump and also gathering compromising_information kompromat on him in an effort to blackmail him The memos among other allegations claim the Russian_government fed the Trump campaign valuable intelligence on Clinton The dossier mirrors a separate conclusion by US intelligence_agencies that the Russian_government intervened in the US election in an effort to bolster Trump and harm Clinton such as through hacking the Democratic_National Committee and distributing materials to WikiLeaks to publish at key moments As the statedWe assess Russian President_Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed_at the US presidential_election Russias goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process denigrate Secretary Clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump We have high confidence in these judgmentsRussian President_Vladimir Putin intensely disliked Clinton because he was convinced that when she was secretary of state she had promoted anti-Putin pro-democracy efforts in his country The FBI considered the information gathered by Steele to be of sufficient importance that it although it later dropped the idea The DNC and Clinton campaign as the Democratic donors who paid Fusion_GPS for Steeles research (Technically Perkins_Coie the law_firm of Marc Elias an attorney representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC funded the research)Separately a Republican donor who had earlier hired Fusion_GPS for information on Trump to be the Washington Free_Beacon a conservative website But that earlier effort is unrelated to the Democratic-funded research that yielded the dossier as Steele was hired by Fusion_GPS after work for the Free_Beacon had endedWe should note that in another assignment Fusion had been hired by a US law_firm in early 2014 to assist on the defense against a civil action filed by the US government alleging fraud by Prevezon Holdings Prevezon is owned by Denis Katsyv the son of a senior Russian_government officialWhy is that relevant Natalia Veselnitskaya who was also working for the law_firm on the Prevezon case met with Trump campaign officials at the Trump_Tower in June_2016 including Donald Trump Jr campaign_manager Paul_Manafort and Jared_Kushner the husband of Ivanka Trump Donald Trump Jr agreed to meet with Veselnitskaya after an intermediary promised dirt on Clinton She arrived with a memo containing by Yuri Chaika Russias prosecutor general who is known as a master of kompromat The Trump White_House has between the dossier andClinton to claim that this shows that rather_than Trump colluding with Russia Clinton colluded with Russia (The theory appears to be that because Steele was getting information from Russian officials in part with funds provided by the Clinton campaign the Russians were helping Clinton)But that ignores the fact that DNC emails as well as the email account of the Clinton campaign_chairman were hacked and then published by WikiLeaks as part of the pro-Trump Russian operation identified byUS intelligence_agencies (Wikileaks denies it received the material from Russia) Indeed the Wall_Street Journal that a prominent Trump donor and the chief_executive of a data-analytics firm working for Trumps presidential campaign in August 2016 discussed how to better organize the Clinton-related emails being released by Wikileaks in order to leverage their impactSteele started producing his memos in June_2016 about the same_time that intelligence_agencies began investigating possible ties_between Russia and people close to Trump The connection between Steeles research and official government investigations is murky but for some Republicans it raises questions about whether the official probe begun in the Obama_administration was influenced by information gathered by someone being paid by DemocratsCNN for instance that the FBI used information in the Steele memos to obtain approval from the secret court that oversees the Foreign_Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to monitor the communications of Carter_Page who Trump had said was a key adviser on national_security issues Presumably the FBI had verified the information before it could cite it in court Steele had quoted an ethnic Russian close associate of Trump as saying Page was an intermediary in a well-developed conspiracy of co-operation between the Trump campaign and the Russian leadership Page has adamantly denied any wrongdoingSteele during the campaign at Fusions direction also briefed reporters from some US news_organizations including The Washington_Post on his findings Only one publication Mother Jones based on the briefing before the election In 2010 Rosatom the Russian nuclear energy agency acquired a controlling stake in Uranium_One a Canadian-based company that had mining licenses at the time for about 20_percent of US uranium_extraction capacity (Note and the United_States as a whole extracts relatively little uranium) The agreement was approved by the Obama_administration when Clinton was secretary of stateFrank Giustra a Canadian mining financier and a major contributor to the Clinton_Foundation had sold a company UrAsia to Uranium_One in 2007 Individuals related to Uranium_One and UrAsia including Giustra donated to the Clinton_Foundation totaling about $145 million though most of the donations took_place before and during her 2008 presidential run Meanwhile in 2010 Bill_Clinton received $500000 from a Russian bank to give a speech at a conference in MoscowTrump during the campaign tossed all of these separate facts together to falsely claim that Clinton gave 20_percent of our uranium gave Russia for a big payment But numerous fact_checks have for this claim The original suggestion of wrongdoing was first raised in a book underwritten by an organization headed by Stephen_K Bannon a key adviser to Trump Whenever news about the Russia investigation heats up the Trump White_House cites the uranium_deal in an effort to muddy the waters and suggest that Russia had gained something from Clinton in exchange for money Trump himself has claimed the case is Watergate modern ageBut there is no_evidence Clinton even was informed about this deal The Treasury Department was the key agency that headed the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United_States which approved the investment Clinton did_not participate in the CFIUS decision The deal was also approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Ultimately only the president could have blocked or suspended the arrangementMoreover no uranium produced at Uranium_Ones US mines may be exported except for some uranium yellowcake which is extracted and processed in Canada before being returned to the United_States for use in nuclear power plants[The Hill newspaperon Nov 2 that some of the uranium from Uranium_One facilities was exported to Europe We had noted before that the uranium could not be exported with the exception of yellowcake being shipped to Canada for conversion with the expectation it would be returned to the United_States But once Uranium_Ones material arrived in Canada it apparently was mixed with yellowcake from other suppliers and then Canada received permission from the Energy Department to send converted USuraniumto Europe for enrichment Uranium_One says it sold about 25 percent of its US-extracted yellowcake via book transfer to customers overseaswhich does_not necessarily mean the material moved because ownership in commodity markets is not the same as possession US officials say it is unknown whether any uranium extracted by Uranium_One was transferred overseas] The Hill newspaper on Oct 22 the FBI had gathered evidence at the time of the sale that a Russian Rosatom official had conducted a massive bribery scheme compromising an American trucking company that shipped uranium for Russia The official eventually but Republicans have said the case about the Rosatom investment in Uranium_One and possibly blocked the deal But there is no_evidence that US officials weighing the transaction knew about the FBI investigationThe reporting prompted House Republicans to announce they would launch an investigation With the Justice_Department gave a former FBI informant in the case approval to testify before Congress The informants lawyer claimed he would discuss his work uncovering the Russian nuclear bribery case and the efforts he witnessed by Moscow to gain influence with [former president Bill_Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton] in hopes of winning favorable uranium decisions from the Obama_administration Any suggestion that Russian money was directed to influence Clintons decisions would be explosive But the fatal flaw in this allegation is Hillary_Clinton by all accounts did_not participate in any discussions regarding the Uranium_One sale which as we noted does_not actually result in the removal of uranium from the United States()Hillary Clintons involvement with a Russian uranium_deal has come under_scrutiny since author and Breitbart_News senior editor-at-large Peter Schweizer dedicated a chapter to the topic in his 2015 book Clinton Cash The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary RichThe Trump campaign has been attacking Clinton over the uranium_deal lately perhaps as a way to distract attention from criticism of Trumps interest in fostering a closer relationship with Russia Clinton Cash was made into a graphic novel and a documentary and on Oct 20 makers of the graphic novel released an about the uranium_deal FactCheckorg and PolitiFact have covered the facts and we wrote about the deal briefly in a But with the renewed attention this month we decided to take a deeper look at Clintons role in this dealThe Trump campaign pointed to an about this deal based on a preview of Clinton Cash The Times said it scrutinized his [Schweizers] information and built upon it with its own reportingThe story starts with Frank Giustra a Canadian mining financier and donor to the Clinton_Foundation Giustras company UrAsia and Uranium_One a uranium mining company headquartered in TorontoIn 2007 Giustra sold UrAsia to Uranium_One which was based in South Africa and chaired by his friend Ian Telfer Giustra said he in the deal in fall 2007 shortly_after the merger with Uranium_One in the midst of Clintons 2008 presidential campaign and before Clinton realizedBarack Obama would win the nomination and she would become his secretary of stateIn 2009 Russias nuclear energy agency Rosatom began buying shares in Uranium_One as a part of a larger move to acquire mines around the world Rosatom first bought a 17 percent share of Uranium_One which has holdings in the United_States In 2010 the Russians sought to increase their share to 51 percent The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United_States (CFIUS) and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the deal In 2013 Russia assumed 100_percent ownershipThe deal gave Russia control of about 20_percent of US uranium_extraction capacity according to a about the deal In other_words Russia has rights to the uranium extracted at those sites which represents 20_percent of the US uranium production capacityThe State_Department was one of nine agencies comprising CFIUS which vets potential national_security impacts of transactions where a foreign government gains control of a US company It was established by Congress in 2007 after the controversy over the planned purchase of seaports by a company in United Arab_Emirates The other agencies were the departments of Treasury Defense Justice Commerce Energy and Homeland_Security andtwo White_House agencies (Office of the US Trade Representative and Office of Science and Technology Policy)The CFIUS can approve a deal but can suspend or stop a transaction If the committee cant come to a consensus a member can recommend a suspension or prohibition of the deal and the president makes the callDue to confidentiality laws there are few details made public about the deal or about Clintons role in it The Clinton campaign Clinton herself was not involved in the State Departments review and did_not direct the department to take any position on the sale of Uranium_One Matters of the CFIUS did_not rise to the level of the secretary the campaign saidJose Fernandez then-assistant secretary of state for economic energy and business affairs sat on the committee Fernandez told the Times Mrs Clinton never intervened with me on any CFIUS matter Fernandez did_not respond to our requests for commentHillarys opposition [to the Uranium_One deal] would have been enough under CFIUS rules to have the decision on the transaction kicked up to the president That never happened Schweizer wrote in Clinton CashAt the time the sale was underway the Obama_administration was its relations with Russia with Clinton leading the effort as secretary of state But there is no_evidence approval of the sale was connected to the reset policy The national_security concern that the United_States faced when CFIUS considered the deal concerned American dependence on foreign uranium sources the Times reportedYet the Uranium_One deal was not on the radar ofMichael McFaul even_though he was aware of many CFIUS cases in his role as the National_Security Councils senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs from 2009 to 2012 (and as a prime architect of the administrations reset policy) McFaul now senior fellow at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institution said Fernandez could not dictate the outcome of any decision single-handedly as he was one of nine membersKnowing how the CFIUS process works and how the bureaucracy at the State_Department works I cannot imagine that such an issue would be reviewed by the secretary of state There is a hierarchy in place precisely to protect the secretarys time for only the most_important of issues and meetings McFaul saidI was not personally involved because that wasnt something the secretary of state did Clinton told in June 2015Some Republican lawmakers in 2010 did raise concerns about the deal but they to then-Treasury Secretary Timothy F Geithner () Final approval which noted that the mines would remain under the control of US subsidiaries Neither Uranium_One nor ARMZ [the Russian firm] holds an NRC export license so no uranium produced at either facility may be exported the NRC said (Some uranium yellowcake is extracted processed in Canada and returned to the United States)We asked the Trump campaign for evidence that Clinton or the State_Department had more of a role in the deal than any of the eight other member agencies of CFIUS and did_not receive a responseDid the Clintons get paid for the Russian dealThe Trump campaign pointed todonations to the Clinton_Foundation as reported by the Times Giustra became friends with Bill_Clinton in 2005 over their charity work The Washington_Post took an at their ties and described their friendship as one that has helped propel the Clinton_Foundation into a global giant and established Giustras reputation as an international philanthropist while helping him build connections in countries where his business was expandingGiustra eventually became one of the largest individual donors to the Clinton_Foundation His relationship with the Clintons came under_scrutiny over donors to the Clinton Giustra_Enterprise Partnership (Canada) which raises money for the similarly named Clinton Giustra_Enterprise Partnership one of the Clinton Foundations initiatives (For more on this read more about it and )Individuals related to Uranium_One and UrAsia including Giustra and Telfer donated to the Clinton_Foundation totaling about $145 million The Times reported that Telfer also donated to the Clinton_Foundation using his family charity based in Canada These were donations made to the Clinton_Foundation not directly to the ClintonsAs the majority of these donations were made before and during Clintons 2008 presidential run So Trumps claim that Hillary_Clinton gave [uranium to] Russia for a big payment is not accurate If she had actually become president she would have had more power over the deal than as the head of one agency among nine represented on CFIUSThe Trump campaign also noted that Bill_Clinton received speaking fees while the Uranium_One deal was underway After the Russians announced that they would acquire stakes in Uranium_One and while the Kremlin was promoting the purchase Bill_Clinton received $500000 in 2010 for a speech in Moscow from a Russian investment bank that had ties to the Kremlin Putin personally thanked Clinton adding that a review of Bill_Clintons speeches found no_evidence that speaking fees were paid to the former president in exchange for any action by Mrs ClintonThe Times also did_not report a direct link between Bill_Clinton and the deal The banks analysts talked up Uranium_Ones stock while the deal was under CFIUS consideration and assigned it a buy rating The bank would not comment on the genesis of Mr Clintons speech to an audience that included leading Russian officials or on whether it was connected to the Rosatom deal the Times reportedTrump and his campaign claim that Clinton gave or handed over 20_percent of American uranium rights to the Russians Through the Uranium_One deal the Russian state-owned nuclear energy company does now have control over 20_percent of US uranium_extraction capacity But it cannot export the uraniumIn 2010 the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United_States approved the sale of the majority of the shares to the Russians The State_Department was one of nine agencies on the committee that approved the deal The deal was also separately approved by the Nuclear Regulatory CommissionThere is no_evidence Clinton herself got involved in the deal personally and it is highly questionable that this deal even rose to the level of the secretary of stateTheoretically as Schweizer says Clinton could have intervened But even then it ultimately would have been Obamas decision whether to suspend or block the dealWe wavered between Three and Four Pinocchios Trump so often uses broad-brushed language that pushes him into Four Pinocchio territory and this is yet_another one of those cases He specifically names Hillary_Clinton as the active agent in the Uranium_One deal saying she gave them or handed over uranium to the Russians but that is not the case Then he further claimed the sale went forward in exchange for a big payment Theres_no evidence for that claim eitherTrump could have avoided so many Pinocchios had he been more careful with the language For_example Hillary_Clintons State_Department was one of nine agencies that approved the deal Words matter()How would you rate this claim (The_check mark_means you think the statement is true not that you agree with the rating)We_need to verify that you are an actual_person This is a non-scientific_user poll_Results are not statistically_valid and cannot be assumed to reflect the views of Washington_Post users as a group or the general populationA couple of days before a host of celebrities spoke out against President

order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) House_Intelligence Committee_Chairman Devin_Nunes a Republican lawmaker from California echoed what seems like the administrations line over the weekendThis is almost like McCarthyism revisited said Nunes to reporters in California to oversee an investigationWere going to go on a witch_hunt against innocent AmericansOn Monday Nunes once more attempted to away from the White_House Theres been major crimes committed said Nunes referring to leaks from the intelligence_community that spurred the Russia allegations What Im concerned about is no one is focusing on major leaks that have occurred here We cant run a government like this A government cant function with massive leaks at the highest levelFirst the cries of McCarthyism fromNunes and other Republicanswere first utteredby figures on the American far-left last_year They lambasted liberal supporters of Hillary_Clinton for instead of properly reckoning with the Now two camps from the opposite sides of the Cold War find themselves in the same cornerSecond the move to quashleakscarries echoes of an earlier era when former president Richard M Nixon and FBI_Director J Edgar Hoover both comrades in arms with McCarthy in the face of Nixons own political scandal Things ultimately didnt end well for that Republican presidentThird as Both their political careers were launched by opportunistically channeling the fears of the moment Both men would have happily taken up some other cause had it offered them a path to fame and power wrote Beinart It was their own party and political elites more generally who bred the hostility and fear that they exploited the Trumpadministrationtried to compel CIA officials and Republican politicians to push back on the Russia story in conversations with reporters Efforts by the White_House to spin this story their way before the investigation has run its course and efforts by congressional Republicans to prop up that spin are already looking like ham-handed political interference While Nunes argued there was nothing much to investigate his Democratic colleague on the House_Intelligence Committee Rep Adam Schiff of California that no meaningful investigation has yet taken place He and other lawmakers are demanding hearings thatwould compel agencies like the FBI to clarify what they know and dont_know about Russian_meddling in the elections and contacts with the Trump campAs its probably certain that Moscow wanted to influence the US elections 17 different federal intelligence_agencies after all agreed that Russia was responsible for hacking the Democratic_National Committees emailsRussia or Putin did_not get Trump elected Americans elected Trump said Russian-American journalist Masha Gessen in Russians basically played their sort of classic disruptive role of trying to do something that will both delegitimize democratic mechanisms and throw wrenches into the process They never expected to succeedIn the near future you can expect morewrangling and bluster as the tussle over Russias role continuesFormer Pres George_W Bush We all need answers on extent of contact between Pres Trumps team and Russia ABC News (@ABC) If so at_least one Republican politician may call out Trump for his demagoguery former president George_W BushI

remains so nowThe Grand Jury for the District of Columbia chargesAt all times relevant to this Indictment1 Defendants PAUL_J MANAFORT_JR (MANAFORT) and RICHARD_W GATES_III (GATES) served for years as political consultants and lobbyists Between at_least 2006 and 2015 MANAFORT and GATES acted as unregistered agents of the Government of Ukraine the Party of Regions (a Ukrainian political party whose leader Victor Yanukovych was President from 2010 to 2014) Yanukovych and the Opposition Bloc (a successor to the Party of Regions that formed in 2014 when Yanukovych fled to Russia) MANAFORT and GATES generated tens of millions of dollars in income as a result of their Ukraine work In order to hide Ukraine payments from United_States authorities from approximately 2006 through at_least 2016 MANAFORT and GATES laundered the money through scores of United_States and foreign corporations partnerships and bank accounts2 In furtherance of the scheme MANAFORT and GATES funneled millions of dollars in payments into foreign nominee companies and bank_accounts opened by them and their accomplices in nominee names and in various foreign countries including Cyprus Saint Vincent the Grenadines (Grenadines) and the Seychelles MANAFORT and GATES hid the existence of the foreign companies and bank_accounts falsely and repeatedly reporting to their tax preparers and to the United_States that they had no foreign_bank accounts3 In furtherance of the scheme MANAFORT and GATES concealed from the United_States their work as agents of and millions of dollars in payments from Ukraine and its political parties and leaders Because MANAFORT and GATES among other things directed a campaign to lobby United_States officials on behalf of the Government of Ukraine the President of Ukraine and Ukrainian political parties they were required by law to report to the United_States their work and fees MANAFORT and GATES did_not do so Instead when the Departmentof Justice sent inquiries to MANAFORT and GATES in 2016 about their activities MANAFORT and GATES responded with a series of false and misleading statements4 In furtherance of the scheme MANAFORT used his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United_States without paying taxes on that income MANAFORT without reporting the income to his tax preparer or the United_States spent millions of dollars on luxury goods and services for himself and his extended family through payments wired from offshore nominee accounts to United_States vendors MANAFORT also used these offshore_accounts to purchase multi-million dollar properties in the United_States MANAFORT then borrowed millions of dollars in loans using these properties as collateral thereby obtaining cash in the United_States without reporting and paying taxes on the income In order to increase the amount of money he could access in the United_States MANAFORT defrauded the institutions that loaned money on these properties so that they would lend him more money at more favorable rates than he would otherwise be able to obtain5 GATES aided MANAFORT in obtaining money from these offshore_accounts which he was instrumental in opening Like MANAFORT GATES used money from these offshore_accounts to pay for his personal expenses including his mortgage childrens tuition and interior decorating of his Virginia residence6 In total more_than $75000000 flowed through the offshore_accounts MANAFORT laundered more_than $18000000 which was used by him to buy property goods and services in the United_States income that he concealed from the United_States Treasury the Department of Justice and others GATES transferred more_than $3000000 from the offshore_accounts to other accounts that he controlled7 MANAFORT was a United_States citizen He resided in homes in Virginia Florida and Long Island New York8 GATES was a United_States citizen He resided in Virginia9 In 2005 MANAFORT and another partner created Davis Manafort Partners Inc (DMP) to engage principally in political consulting DMP had staff in the United_States Ukraine and Russia In 2011 MANAFORT created DMP International LLC (DMI) to engage in work for foreign clients in particular political consulting lobbying and public relations for the Government of Ukraine the Party of Regions and members of the Party of Regions DMI was a partnership solely owned by MANAFORT and his spouse GATES worked for both DMP and DMI and served as MANAFORTs right-hand man10 The Party of Regions was a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine Beginning in approximately 2006 it retained MANAFORT through DMP and then DMI to advance its interests in Ukraine including the election of its slate of candidates In 2010 its candidate for President Yanukovych was elected President of Ukraine In 2014 Yanukovych fled Ukraine for Russia in the wake of popular protests of widespread governmental corruption Yanukovych the Party of Regions and the Government of Ukraine were MANAFORT DMP and DMI clients11 The European Centre for a Modern Ukraine (the Centre) was created in or about 2012 in Belgium as a mouthpiece for Yanukovych and the Party of Regions The Centre was used by MANAFORT GATES and others in order to lobby and conduct a public relations campaign in the United_States and Europe on behalf of the existing Ukraine regime The Centre effectively ceased to operate upon the downfall of Yanukovych in 201412 MANAFORT and GATES owned or controlled the following entities which were used in the scheme (the MANAFORT-GATES entities)()13 The Internal_Revenue Service (IRS) was a bureau in the United_States Department of the Treasury responsible for administering the tax laws of the United_States and collecting taxes owed to the Treasury14 Between in or around 2008 and 2017 both dates being approximate and inclusive in the District of Columbia and elsewhere MANAFORT and GATES devised and intended to devise and executed and attempted to execute a scheme and artifice to defraud and to obtain money and property by means of false and fraudulent pretenses representations and promises from the United_States banks and other financial institutions As part of the scheme MANAFORT and GATES repeatedly provided false information to financial bookkeepers tax accountants and legal counsel among others15 In order to use the money in the offshore nominee accounts of the MANAFORT-GATES entities without paying taxes on it MANAFORT and GATES caused millions of dollars in wire transfers from these accounts to be made for goods services and real_estate They did_not report these transfers as income to DMP DMI or MANAFORT16 From 2008 to 2014 MANAFORT caused the following wires totaling over $12000000 to be sent to the vendors listed below for personal items MANAFORT did_not pay taxes on this income which was used to make the purchases()17 In 2012 MANAFORT caused the following wires to be sent to the entities listed below to purchase the real_estate also

made under_oath must disclose the name of the foreign_principal the financial payments to the lobbyist and the measures undertaken for the foreign_principal among other information A person required to make such a filing must further make in all lobbying material a conspicuous statement that the materials are distributed on behalf of the foreign_principal among other things The filing thus permits public awareness and evaluation of the activities of a lobbyist who acts as an agent of a foreign power or foreign political party in the United States19 In furtherance of the scheme from 2006 until 2014 both dates being approximate and inclusive MANAFORT and GATES engaged in a multi-million dollar lobbying campaign in the United_States at the direction of Yanukovych the Party of Regions and the Government of Ukraine MANAFORT and GATES did so without registering and providing the disclosures required by law20 As part of the scheme in February 2012 MANAFORT and GATES solicited two Washington DC firms (Company A and Company B) to lobby in the United_States on behalf of Yanukovych the Party of Regions and the Government of Ukraine For_instance GATES wrote to Company_A that it would be representing the Government of Ukraine in [Washington] DC21 MANAFORT repeatedly communicated in person and in writing with Yanukovych and GATES passed on directions to Company_A and Company_B For_instance MANAFORT wrote Yanukovych a memorandum dated April 8 2012 in which he provided Yanukovych an update on the lobbying_firms activities since the inception of the project a few_weeks ago It is my intention to provide you with a weekly update moving forward Toward the end of that first year in November 2012 GATES wrote to Company_A and Company_B that the firms needed to prepare an assessment of their past and prospective lobbying efforts so the President could be briefed by Paul on what Ukraine has done well and what it can do better as we move into 201322 At the direction of MANAFORT and GATES Company_A and Company_B engaged in extensive lobbying Among other things they lobbied multiple Members of Congress and their staffs about Ukraine sanctions the validity of Ukraine elections and the propriety of Yanukovychs imprisoning his presidential rival Yulia Tymoshenko (who had served as Ukraine President prior to Yanukovych) MANAFORT and GATES also lobbied in connection with the roll out of a report concerning the Tymoshenko trial commissioned by the Government of Ukraine MANAFORT and GATES used one of their offshore_accounts to funnel $4 million to pay secretly for the report23 To minimize public disclosure of their lobbying campaign MANAFORT and GATES arrangedfor the Centre to be the nominal client of Company_A and Company_B even_though in fact the Centre was under the ultimate direction of the Government of Ukraine Yanukovych and the Party of Regions For_instance MANAFORT and GATES selected Company_A and Company_B and only thereafter did the Centre sign contracts with the lobbying_firms without ever meeting either company Company_A and Company_B were paid for their services not by their nominal client the Centre but solely through off-shore accounts associated with the MANAFORT-GATES entities namely Bletilla Ventures Limited (in Cyprus) and Jeunet Ltd and Global Endeavour Inc (in Grenadines) In total Company_A and Company_B were paid more_than $2 million from these accounts between 2012 and 201424 To conceal the scheme MANAFORT and GATES developed a false and misleading cover story that would distance themselves and the Government of Ukraine Yanukovych and the Party of Regions from the Centre Company_A and Company_B For_instance in the wake of extensive press reports on MANAFORT and his connections with Ukraine on August 16 2016 GATES communicated false talking_points to Company_B in writing includingCompany B through a principal replied to GATES the same_day that theres a lot of email traffic that has you much more involved than this suggests [] We will not disclose that but heaven knows what former employees of [Company B] or [Company A] might say25 In September 2016 after numerous recent press reports concerning MANAFORT the Department of Justice informed MANAFORT GATES and DMI that it sought to determine_whether they had acted as agents of a foreign_principal under the Foreign_Agents Registration_Act (FARA) without registering In November 2016 and February 2017 MANAFORT GATES and DMI caused false and misleading letters to be submitted to the Department of Justice which mirrored the false cover story set out above The letters both of which were approved by MANAFORT and GATES before they were submitted represented among other things that26 In fact MANAFORT and GATES had selected Company_A and Company_B engaged in weekly scheduled calls and frequent emails with Company_A and Company_B to provide them directions as to specific lobbying steps that should be taken sought and received detailed oral and written reports from these firms on the lobbying work they had performed communicated with Yanukovych to brief him on their lobbying efforts both congratulated and reprimanded Company_A and Company_B on their lobbying work communicated directly with United_States officials in connection with this work and paid the lobbying_firms over $2 million from offshore_accounts they controlled among other things In_addition court-authorized searches of MANAFORT and GATES DMI email accounts and MANAFORTs Virginia residence in July 2017 revealed numerous documents including documents related to lobbying which were more_than thirty-days old at the time of the November 2016 letter to the Department of Justice27 United_States citizens who have authority_over certain foreign_bank accounts whether or not the accounts are set_up in the names of nominees who act for their principals have reporting obligations to the United States28 First the Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations require United_States citizens to report to the United_States Treasury any financial interest in or signatory authority_over any bank account or other financial account held in foreign countries for every calendar year in which the aggregate balarice of all such foreign accounts exceeds $10000 at any point during the year This is commonly_known as a foreign_bank account report or FBAR The Bank Secrecy Act requires these reports because they have a high degree of usefulness in criminal tax or regulatory investigations or proceedings The United_States Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is the custodian for FBAR filings and FinCEN provides access to its FBAR database to law_enforcement entities including the Federal Bureau of Investigation The reports filed by individuals and businesses are used by law_enforcement to identify detect and deter money_laundering that furthers criminal enterprise activity tax evasion and other unlawful activities29 Second United_States citizens also are obligated to report information to the IRS regarding foreign_bank accounts For_instance in 2010 Form 1040 Schedule B had a Yes or No box to record an answer to the question At any time during [the calendar year] did you have an interest in or a signature or other authority_over a financial account in a foreign country such as a bank account securities account or other financial account If the answer was Yes then the form required the taxpayer to enter the name of the foreign country in which the financial account was located30 For each year in or about and between 2008 through at_least 2014 MANAFORT had authority_over foreign accounts that required an FBAR report Specifically MANAFORT was required to report to the United_States Treasury each foreign_bank account held by the foreign MANAFORT-GATES entities noted above in paragraph 12 that bear the initials PM No FBAR reports were made by MANAFORT for these accounts31 For each year in or about and between 2008 through at_least 2013 GATES had authority_over foreign accounts that required an FBAR report Specifically GATES was required to report to the United_States Treasury each foreign_bank account held by the foreign MANAFORT-GATES entities noted above in paragraph 12 that bear the initials RG as well as three other accounts in the United Kingdom No FBAR reports were made by GATES for these accounts32 Furthermore in each of MANAFORTs tax filings for 2008 through 2014 MANAFORT represented falsely that he did_not have authority_over any foreign_bank accounts MANAFORT and GATES had repeatedly and falsely represented in writing to MANAFORTs tax preparer that MANAFORT had no authority_over foreign_bank accounts knowing that such false representations would result in false MANAPORT tax filings For_instance on October 4 2011 MANAFORTs tax preparer asked MANAFORT in writing At any time during 2010 did you [or your wife or children] have an interest in or a signature or other authority_over a financial account in a foreign country such as a bank account securities account or other financial account On the same_day MANAFORT falsely responded NO MANAPORT responded the same way as recently as October 3 2016 when MANAFORTs tax preparer again emailed the question in connection with the preparation of MANAFORTs tax_returns Foreign bank_accounts etc MANAPORT responded on or about the same_day NONE33 After MANAFORT used his offshore_accounts to purchase real_estate in the United_States he took out mortgages on the properties thereby allowing MANAFORT to have the benefits of liquid income without paying taxes on it Further MANAPORT defrauded the banks that loaned him the money so that he could withdraw more money at a cheaper rate than he otherwise would have been permitted34 In 2012 MANAFORT through a corporate vehicle called MC Soho Holdings LLC owned by him and his family bought a condominium on Howard Street in the Soho neighborhood in Manhattan New_York He paid approximately $2850000 All the money used to purchase the condominium came from MANAFORT entities in Cyprus MANAFORT used the property from at_least January 2015 through 2016 as an income-generating rental property charging thousands of dollars a week on Airbnb among other places In his tax_returns MANAFORT took advantage of the beneficial tax consequences of owning this rental property35 In late 2015 through early 2016 MANAFORT applied for a mortgage on the condominium Because the bank would permit a greater loan amount if the property were owner-occupied MANAFORT falsely represented to the bank and its agents that it was a secondary home used as such by his daughter and son-in-law and was not a property held as a rental property For_instance on January 26 2016 MANAFORT wrote to his son-in-law to advise him that when the bank appraiser came to assess the condominium his son-in-law should [r]emember he believes that you and [MANAFORTs daughter] are living there Based on a request from MANAFORT GATES caused a document to be created which listed the Howard Street property as the second home of MANAFORTs daughter and son-in-law when GATES knew this fact to be false As a result of his false representations in March_2016 the bank provided MANAFORT a loan for approximately $318500036 Also in 2012 MANAFORT through a corporate vehicle called MC Brooklyn Holdings LLC similarly owned by him and his family bought a brownstone on Union Street in the CarrollGardens section of Brooklyn New_York He paid approximately $3000000 in cash for the property All of that money carne from a MANAFORT entity in Cyprus After purchase of the property MANAFORT began renovations to transform it from a multi-family dwelling into a single family home In late 2015 through early 2016 MANAFORT sought to borrow cash against the property The institution MANAFORT went to for the loan provided greater loan amounts for construction loans that is loans that required the loan amounts to be used to pay solely for construction of the property and thus increase the value of the property serving as the loans collateral The institution would thus loan money against the expected completed value of the property which in the case of the Union Street property was estimated to be $8000000 In early 2016 MANAFORT was able to obtain a loan of approximately $5000000 after promising the bank that approximately $1400000 of the loan would be used solely for construction of the Union Street property However MANAFORT never intended to limit use of the proceeds to construction as required by the loan contracts In December 2015 before the loan was made MANAFORT wrote his tax preparer among others that the construction loan will allow me to pay back the [another Manafort apartment] mortgage in full Further when the construction loan closed MANAFORT used hundreds of thousands of dollars from the construction loan to make a down payment on another property in California37 Paragraphs_1 through

eliciting groans from critics wary of four years of what as alternative factsBut a few brave souls chose to go high on social_media and look at the positive aspects of living in Spicers worldHow wonderful would it be to use #AlternativeFactsin our everyday livesIt could be the best news since last yearAnd just like that #SeanSpicerSays and #SeanSpicerFacts were bornI ate a salad for lunch today Mari Dwyer (@maridwy) Guess the number of jelly beansMe 87Wife 134Sean Spicer 15 million Mark Zohar (@markzohar) For those who missed it Spicer graced the lectern of the White_House briefing room on Saturday to dispute the mainstream medias efforts to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the Mall during Trumps inaugurationMetal detectors slowed peoples arrival to the mall he said White floor coverings used for the first time highlighted empty spaces making it look as though fewer people had showed up And the reckless media put out a false narrative playing down how many came out to support TrumpHis key point No one had numbers because the National Park Service which controls the Mall does_not put any outSpicer then goes on to list a few numbers that back up his assertion that Fridays crowd was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration period both in person and around the globe That touched off a brief flurry to determine_whether Spicer had spoken correctlyFor example crowd estimates can be fuzzy but Metro keeps count of every person who uses a Metro card to hop onto a train and Spicer mentioned Metro numbers in his remarksAccording to Metro Fridays ridership was the lowest in at_least two presidential inaugurationsAs people took 570557 trips in the system between its early 4 am Friday opening through its midnight closingThe figures are significantly lower than those from the 2009 and 2013 inaugurations of President_Barack Obama 11 million trips in 2009 and 782000 in 2013 according to MetroAnd The Posts Fact_Checker gave Spicer Four Pinocchios adding after examining his other statementsAfter his remarks on Saturday Spicer refused to take questions and strode off the stage apparently unaware that he had just become a memeThe

things he posted for his 129 million followers a Sunday morning declaration that the White_House had not issued a statement on the Womens March on Washington a day after the inauguration despite conflicting reportsHe also retweeted the White_House correspondent for Time who erroneously reported that Trump had removed a bust of the Rev Martin Luther King Jr from the Oval_Office Miller used Twitter to apologize to his colleaguesApology accepted Spicer tweeted and later he added this admonishment A reminder of the media danger of tweet first check facts laterA few minutes before the sun rose over Mar-a-Lago President Trump was up thumbing a series of tweets about Barack_Obama and some of the darker days of 20th century American historyIn particular he was just before the 2016 election tactics Trump said hearkened to the McCarthy hearings and Red Scare of the late 1940s and 50sNothing found Trump tweeted This is McCarthyismTerrible Just found out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump_Tower just before the victory Nothing found This is McCarthyism Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) McCarthyism is something of which Trump should have in-depth knowledgeHis lifelong attorney and mentor Roy Cohn one of the men who helped mold Trump into Trump was as one author called it Joseph McCarthys sidekick - whose lifelong mentor was Joseph McCarthys sidekick - complains of modern-day McCarthyism today West_Wing Reports (@WestWingReport) After World_War II McCarthy a Republican senator from Wisconsin that large numbers of communist spies and sympathizers had infiltrated the US government and needed to be weeded outThe accusations happened during a period of escalating tensions with the Soviet_Union and growing fears about the global spread of communism McCarthy interrogated alleged sympathizers at Senate hearings that came to bear his name Just an accusation could ruin reputations and careers Cohn was the brains behind McCarthys rise to power and to many Americans one ofthe first real television personalities according to Mr Cohn with his slick hair dark complexion and heavy-lidded eyes the obit said was frequently seen whispering in the senators earEventually though Cohns influence in Washington waned as McCarthy and his hearings lost public supportDecades later after Cohn returned to New_York he had Trumps earThey first met in New_York in October 1973 when Trump was 27 and beginning to make his fortune in his familys real_estate business Cohn then 46 was a high-profile defense lawyer with connections in city government and in the courtsHe used his connections to reward friends and punish opponentsaccording toThere were however legions of Cohn detractors He was a source of great evil in this society Victor A Kovner a Democratic activist in New_York City and First Amendment lawyer told OHarrow and BoburgHe was a vicious Red-baiting source of sweeping wrongdoing Cohn represented Trump and his dad Fred when they faced Justice_Department allegations that they discriminated against black rental applicants atthe apartment complexes the family owned or managed according to OHarrow and BoburgOn Dec 12 1973 Cohn called a news_conference saying they were suing the government for $100 million over the allegations In an affidavit Cohn said the government was trying to force subservience to the Welfare DepartmentThe Trumps ultimately settled the case with the government without admitting guilt and declared victoryIn the late 70s and into the 1980s Cohn fought efforts to have him disbarred Through it all Trump was a loyal friend trophy client and protegeRoy had a whole crazy deal going but Roy was a really smart guy who liked me and did a great job for me on different things Trump told The_Post according the story published in June And he was a tough lawyer and thats what I wanted Roy was a very tough guyMore than a year ago the Fact_Checker various claims that Donald Trump then a presidential_candidate had made about Hillary_Clintons alleged role in the approval of the sale of a Canadian company Uranium_One with mining rights in the United_States to Rosatom Russias nuclear energy agency Weve delved deep into the tale and recently since Rep_Devin Nunes head of the House_Intelligence Committee announced thatCongress would launch a new probeHerewe are going to take a closer look at a key claim that the sale involved 20_percent of our uranium Look at how often Tucker Carlson brought up this line in a recent show saying it was insane for Clinton not to realize that a Russian company was getting 20_percent of our uranium supplySebastian Gorka a former Trump White_House aide that Clinton should be tried and potentially executed because the Russians infiltrated our national_security to corner the uranium market and they succeededWe have noted repeatedly thatextracted uranium whichRosatom does_not have but even so this 20_percent figure is especially misleading At the Fact_Checker we a bit more preciselyas mining licenses for about 20_percent of US uranium_extraction capacity But we were out of date it turns out20 percentis an especially stale numberThe original 20_percent figure one of the agencies that approved the deal in 2010 It stated that as of 2010 the licenses represent approximately 20_percent of the currently licensed uranium in-situ recovery production capacity in the United StatesIn-situ recovery (ISR) is to obtain uranium from underground its the main method in the United_States Its generally used for low-grade ore that would be otherwise too expensive to mine A solution is pumped into the ore deposit to dissolve the uranium The resulting liquid is then pumped back out driedso itbecomes yellowcakeandplaced in 55-gallon drumsbefore it is taken to a uranium conversion facility for eventual use in a nuclear power reactorButthe 20_percent number was a 2010 estimate that has now been overtaken by events such asadditional mining licenses being issued The Energy Information Administration has and the Uranium_One assets now represent much less_than 20_percent production capacity because other US operations have been approvedThe NRC has licensed additional in-situ uranium facilities since the 20-percent figure was estimated (and it was an estimate) an NRC spokesman said in an email Our current estimate would be closer to 10 percentThe spokesman added Note also that even the original figure does_not include conventional mines and was nowhere near saying they controlled 20_percent of US uranium reservesUranium One has and may be looking to unload more an industry official said Thats because the US holdings were incidental to the Rosatom purchase of Uranium_One it was more interested in the companys holdings in Kazakhstan the worlds leading uranium producerProduction capacity is one thing but the reality is actual production In fact so much Kazakh uranium is flooding the market that uranium prices have dropped and production in the United_States has plummetedThe industry official said total US production in 2017 is expected to be less_than 1000 tons and production in 2016 was just 1126 tons By contrast Uranium_Ones mines in Kazakhstan alone extracted nearly 3000 tons in 2016Uranium Ones US business has shrunk so quickly that it now represents a tiny part of US production In 2016 its Willow Creek facility extracted just 23 tons Thats 23 percent of all US production In 2015 the project represented 36 percent of US production and in 2014 113 percent In 2013 it was still 20_percent Two other Uranium_One facilities currently are not being minedThis chart shows how Uranium_Ones US production compares with total US production and how US production compares with worldwide production Uranium production in the US is so small that I would rarely if ever use a statistic like that Its meaningless said a nuclear expert at the Middlebury_Institute of International_Studies at Monterey Twenty percent of bupkis is still bupkisA spokesman for Nunes did_not respond to a request for commentThe 20_percent figure has long been in wide circulation As we noted the Fact_Checker recently used it though with caveats But we should have looked at the actual production data and asked the NRC for an updated estimate of production capacity Clearly thenumber is woefully out of dateGiven that Uranium_Ones production is only 2 percent of an already small total US production not 20_percent the overwrought claims that Clinton gave away 20_percent of the US nuclear supply or that Russia controls that much US uraniumare simply absurd()Do you rate this claim as true or false More Pinocchios for false fewer based on your opinion of the statements truthfulness (The_check mark_means you think the statement is true not that you agree with the rating)We_need to verify that you are an actual_person This is a non-scientific_user poll_Results are not statistically_valid and cannot be

went from the top of North_Korea to middle AmericaBreaking their silence in the United_States Ko and Ri spent almost 20 hours talking to two Washington_Post reporters in New_York City and then at their home several hours drive away They were nervous about emerging from their anonymity after all there are Americans who analyze North_Korea for a living and do not even know that the couple are

royal_family and top cadres in the Workers_Party benefit from this system and have the most to lose if it collapses or if they run afoul of the regimeSo the couple decided to flee not to South_Korea as many North_Koreans do but to the United StatesThey have worked long hours running their dry-cleaning store and their three children have come of age here going to good colleges and getting good jobsThe family home is a large two-story house with two cars in the driveway a huge TV in the living room a grill on a rear deck Theyve been to Las_Vegas on vacation and two years_ago went to South_Korea where Ko enjoyed visiting the palaces she had seen in TV dramasThey look like a normal familyBut look closer That photo of her eldest son on a jet-ski Its at Wonsan where the Kim family has its summer residence That girl in the photo album Its Kim Yo Jong who runs the propaganda division of the Workers PartyAnd the house It was bought partly with a one-time payment of $200000 that the CIA gave the couple on their arrival they saidEven though Ko and Ri have not seen Kim_Jong Un in almost 20 years and do not appear to have held official positions US intelligence on North_Korea is so thin that this couple still represents a valuable source of information on the family courtThey can reveal for example that Kim_Jong Un was born in 1984 not 1982 or 1983 as has been widely thought The reason theyre certain It was the same year that their first son was born He and my son were playmates from birth I changed both of their diapers Ko said with a laugh Sometimes operatives from the CIAs national clandestine service come to town to show Ko and Ri photos of North_Koreans and ask who the people areThe CIA declined to confirm or comment on any of Ko and Ris claims Some parts of the couples history can be verified but other parts cannot or seem incompleteEven today Ri in particular is sympathetic toward the North_Korean regime and is trying to get approval to visit Pyongyang And both are careful in what they say about their to whom they refer as Marshal Kim_Jong UnBut what they will say about their former charge paints a picture of a man who was raised knowing that he would one day be king In 1992 Ko Yong Suk arrived in Bern Switzerland with Kim_Jong Chol the first son of Kos sister and Kim_Jong Il who in two years would become the leader of North_Korea Kim_Jong Un arrived in 1996 when he was 12We lived in a normal house and acted like a normal family I acted like their mother Ko said about her time in Bern I encouraged him to bring his friends home because we wanted them to live a normal life I made snacks for the kids They ate cake and played with LegosTraveling on a diplomatic passport Ri went back and forth between North_Korea and Switzerland sometimes ferrying their youngest daughter and Kim_Jong Uns younger sister back and forthThe family spoke Korean at home and ate Korean food but also enjoyed the benefits of an expatriate family in an exotic locale Ko took the Kim children to Euro Disney now Disneyland Paris Kim_Jong Un had been to Tokyo Disneyland with his mother some years before and her photo albums are full of pictures of them skiing in the Swiss Alps swimming on the French Riviera eating at al fresco restaurants in ItalyKim Jong_Un loved games and machinery trying to figure out how ships float and planes fly He was already showing personality traits that would later become much more evidentHe wasnt a troublemaker but he was short-tempered and had a lack of tolerance Ko recalled When his mother tried to tell him off for playing with these things too_much and not studying enough he wouldnt talk back but he would protest in other ways like going on a hunger strikeKim loved going home for the summer spending time in Wonsan where the family has a huge beachfront compound or at their main residence in Pyongyang with its movie theater and plenty of room to hang outHe started playing basketball and he became obsessed with it his aunt said of the young Kim who was a Michael Jordan fan and later hosted basketball player several_times in North_Korea He used to sleep with his basketballHe was shorter than his friends and his mother told him that if he played basketball he would become taller Ko saidLater at their house Ri produced a never-publicly seen photo laminated and stored in an envelope of a slightly built Kim aged 13 and his older brother among a team wearing basketball uniforms after a tournament in Pyongyang Ri is sitting in the front row while Ko is standing in the back Kim is holding a gold trophyThe world did_not know that Kim had been anointed his fathers successor until October 2010 when his status was made official at a Workers_Party conference in Pyongyang But Kim had known since 1992 that he would one day inherit North KoreaThe signal was sent at his eighth birthday party attended by North_Koreas top brass the couple said Kim was given a generals uniform decorated with stars and real generals with real stars bowed to him and paid their respects to him from that moment onIt was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person when the people around him were treating him like that Ko saidFrom a humble background Ko was catapulted into the top echelons of North_Korean society when her sister a performer caught the eye of the princeling Kim_Jong Il and she became his third partner in 1975I was very close to my sister and it was a tough job to be the wife so she asked me to help her She could trust me because I was her own blood Ko saidKim Jong_Il personally selected Ri to marry his sister-in-law They all lived in a compound in Pyongyang with Ko looking after her sisters and her own children for several years We lived the good life Ko said Over a sushi lunch in New_York she reminisced about drinking cognac with sparkling water and eating caviar in Pyongyang about riding with Kim_Jong Il in his Mercedes-BenzThen came the charmed years in Europe But in 1998 Kos sister discovered she had breast cancer and underwent treatment in Switzerland and FranceThis is where Ko and Ris version of events starts to become opaque Given that Ri is trying to get back into Kim_Jong Uns good graces he has reason to present their defection as nothing but altruisticThe way Ri and Ko tell it the cancer treatment in Europe was not working so they decided they should travel to the United_States to try to secure treatment for Kos dying sister Their defection was all about trying to save Kim_Jong Uns mother they sayStories about the couple in the South_Korean news media have suggested that they sought asylum in the United_States because they were concerned about what could happen to them after either of Kim_Jong Uns parents died This was their link to the royal_family and without that link what would happen to themWalking through Central Park on a Sunday morning Ko seemed to imply that this was a concernIn history you often see people close to a powerful leader getting into unintended trouble because of other people she said I thought it would be better if we stayed out of that kind of troubleThey had reason to be scared given Kos sisters position said Michael Madden editor of the websiteKo Yong Hui was an ambitious woman she wanted her sons to be promoted and she made enemies in the process Madden said If you were her sister or her brother-in-law you would feel threatened Someone could easily make you disappear Just look at the case of the uncle who also lived in the Pyongyang compound with Ko and Ri He apparently built up too_much power In 2013 Kim had him executedSo one day in 1998 Ri and Ko and their three children took a taxi to the US Embassy in Bern They said they were North_Korean diplomats and wanted asylum After several days during which time a Korean speaker flew in from Washington they were taken to a US military base near FrankfurtThey stayed in a house on the base for several months while they were questioned Then Ri and Ko disclosed their family connectionsThe American government didnt know who Kim_Jong Un was that he would become the leader Ri saidThe US government did_not tell its ally South_Korea that it had Ko and Ri until they were on American soil apparently infuriating the government in SeoulFor US intelligence_agencies which struggle to get reliable information about the inner workings of the North_Korean regime the defection must have seemed like hitting the intelligence jackpotBut Ri insists they did_not know much They thought we must know some secrets but we didnt know anything he said We were just looking after the children and helping them study so of course we saw a lot of their private lives but we had nothing to do with defense We didnt know any nuclear or military secretsMadden said the pair would have had limited intelligence value Alexandre Mansourov a North_Korean leadership expert who once studied at Kim_Il Sung University in Pyongyang agreedYes they understand the system very well he said However they missed the famine and the recovery the transition to the new leadership and all the events of the last five_years In that sense theyre living in the past When they landed in the United_States the family spent a few_days in the Washington area not far from the CIA before moving to a small city where a South_Korean church had offered to help them as it did for others who escaped the NorthThe people at the church kept asking us questions They knew we were from North_Korea but they told us we didnt look like North_Koreans They kept asking us questions Ko saidSo the family moved to a different city with very few other Koreans or even other AsiansLife was hard at the beginning We had no relatives and we were working for 12 hours every day Ri said He worked as a builder then did maintenance in an apartment house jobs that were easy to do without EnglishKo was frustrated at not being able to work and contribute The only thing I could do without speaking the language was dry cleaning she said in Korean Ri speaks reasonable English today but Kos is still basicSo they opened a small store and began working long hours Ri at the machines and Ko doing alterations They soon hit their stride Seeing my kids doing well in school and my husband working so hard gave me the strength and energy to carry on Ko saidTheir children have no interest in Korea North or South she said They have a comfortable existence but certainly do not appear to be living large Stopping at a gas station for lunch on the way back to their home Ko remarked that bottled water was very cheap and was disappointed that the Dunkin Donuts was out of burritos So why are they breaking their silence nowRi says he wants to visit North_Korea and has come out of their deep cover to dispel what he calls lies being peddled about them and their family in North_Korea by regime critics in South KoreaLast year Ri and Ko moved to sue three high-level North_Korean defectors who had been on South_Korean television accusing them of a variety of activities including having plastic surgery and stealing millions of dollars from the Kim regime The couple hired a celebrity lawyer Kang Yong-seok to pursue a defamation case but it was thrown out on a technicality Kang arranged for The Washington_Post to meet the couple and was present for most of the interviews in New YorkEven after the years the couple has spent in the United_States North_Korea still has some pullRi who is particularly careful around reporters not to speak ill of the regime is positioning himself as the person to bridge the widening gap_between Washington and PyongyangMy ultimate goal is to go back to North_Korea I understand America and I understand North_Korea so I_think I can be a negotiator between the two he said If Kim_Jong Un is how I remembered he used to be I would be able to meet him and talk to himMansourov described Ris hopes to return to North_Korea as ridiculousHe has a nice life in the US Why would he want to go back Unless hes ready to go upstairs he saidKo said she misses her home town the pull of the home town cannot be underestimated in Korean culture but does_not want to go back Nor does she want Ri to visit But how can I change my stubborn husbands mindLuckily for Ko that decision is Kim_Jong Uns And hes not showing any interest in having an intermediary anytime soon to help him improve relations with the United_States Yoonjung_Seo contributed to this reportSEOUL - The South_Korean political system has been shaken to its core over the revelations that from Choi_Soon-sil a friend of 40_years who held no official position and had no policy backgroundThe saga began with a simple and apparently self-contained incident The chief_executive of Nature Republic a South_Korean cosmetics company was arrested for gambling in Macau in November 2015Gambling is illegal for South Koreans and is punishable with prison time even if the South_Korean citizen is caught gambling abroadChung Woon-ho the executive was found guilty and sentenced to a year in prisonDuring the appeal process Chung had a legal dispute with his attorney In the process of probing this dispute a typically South_Korean act of corruption was uncovered involving a prosecutor a businessman and a government officialBut this time it was really serious involving the former chief of the prosecutors office a high-ranking judge the conglomerate Lotte and a senior secretary to the presidentThe investigation uncovered the existence of Lotte slush funds and ended with the suicide of Lottes vice chairman who left a note taking full responsibility The former chief of the prosecutors office and the judge were arrestedHowever the senior secretary to the president and a former senior prosecutor Woo Byung-woo walked away unscathedEight months later South_Koreas biggest newspaper the broke news of another scandal involving a business a prosecutor and a government official A familiar name surfaced again Woo Byung-wooThe Chosun Ilbo reported that an Internet game company Nexon did a favor for Woo by buying his familys land for $120 millionat a time that they were having a trouble selling it The allegation was that the land had been bought in return for Woo turning a blind eye on a prosecutors unlawful gains from Nexon sharesWoo had been in charge of vetting this prosecutor for promotion in 2015The nation was incensed by this allegationof systemic corruption in the justice system The fact that Woo was not investigated only increased suspicion that it was he who held the real power inside the presidential office enough to influence the national justice system Local media began calling him an emperorThen a further Chosun Ilbo investigation led to yet_another government official being exposed for abusing his power This time it was another senior secretary to the president An Chong-bumAn had allegedly been strong-arming conglomerates to donate money to the newly established MI-R FoundationAn had reportedly used the threat of painful audits to extort money from as many as 30 conglomerates Local media reported that it was suspected that An had been raising money that was to be for Parks personal use after she retires in 2018 The former head of the MI-R Foundation later said in an_interview with the Chosun Ilbo that he was told Woo at the presidential office and the prosecutors office had their backJust as the Chosun Ilbos focus was moving ever closer to the president herself one of the lawmakers in Parks ruling managed to deflect attention away from this embarrassing probe and back on to the newspaper byhighlighting the fact that the Chosun Ilbos chief writer had received expensive trips from Daewoo a shipping company in 2011The incident significantly damaged the papers reputation and it suspended its reporting on the relationship betweenthe foundation and the presidential officeThen another local newspaper the left-leaning Hankyoreh brought the story back to life with asurprising twistItpublished a story that named Choi_Soon-sil as the de-factoowner of the MI-R Foundation Choi had been friends with Park since the 1970s and was the daughter of Choi Tae-min a cult founder who was believed to have had huge influence over Park until his death in 1994Park Geun-hye and Choi Tae-mins strange relationship was an open secret in South_Korea but had never been investigatedAs the investigation rolled on suspicion grew concerning Choi Soon-sils undue influence 14 shell companies were linked to her in Germany then a friend claimed that Chois favorite hobby was changing Park Geun-hyes speechesPark initially dismissed the allegations as mere rumors but when a cable channel reported on Oct 24 that the presidents speeches had been found on Choi Soon-sils tablet computer such denials were no_longer plausibleThe president has since made but these have not beenenough to assuage the publics growing anger and tens of thousands ofcitizens have taken to the streets over the past twoweeks calling for her resignationParks approval rating has plummeted to 5 percent according to Gallup Korea the lowest for a president in the polls historyThe investigation isonly just beginning but already Parks senior secretary An Chong-bum and Choi_Soon-sil have been arrested for abuse of power and attempted fraud and corporate officials from conglomerates including Samsung are being questioned by prosecutorsEmperor Woo Byung-woo was also summoned for questioning Sunday As the senior secretary to the president for civil affairs Woos role is to monitor corruption of the people close to the president How he will come out of this scandal remains to be seenNo one knows where the chips may fall in this ongoing saga but this much is clear What began with one businessman playing cards at a table in Macau has now grown into since its democratization in 1987In the most abstract sense there is nothing noteworthy about a government official meeting with an ambassador from a foreign country When such an interaction becomes important is when that official is an ally of a presidential campaign thats got a complex set of possibly inappropriate relationships with other representatives of that ambassadors country and when that official whileunder oathsays he did_not have communications with representatives of that countryWhat were going to endeavor to do here is to parse out that complex set of relationships using the information we have at hand In this case as youve hopefully ascertained the country at issue is Russia and the campaign is that of President Trump The official of course is And the ambassador is at this point the linchpin of a lot of the interactions between Trump and the rest of his teamWell consider three Russian entitiesAs for the American side lets start at the top and move outward through Trumps network Trumps connections to Russian business_interests are murky thanks to his decision not to release his tax_returns during the campaign We know that the Miss_Universe pageant was hosted in Moscow when Trump owned it and that he millions of dollars for doing so We know too that hes repeatedly explored real_estate deals in the country Its not clear whether Trump has met Kislyak though the ambassador a foreign_policy speech Trump gave last spring and the reception that preceded it We know now that Trump has been in communication with Putin but he also claimed to have been in contact with representatives of the Russian president (and Putin himself) Sessionss relationship with Kislyak is well-established by now This is a good point at which to note though that the existence of that relationship does_not in any way imply wrongdoing by Sessions Its just part of the network were establishing Trumps_son-in-law (Ivankas husband) also met with Kislyak during the period between Election_Day and the inauguration according to Kushner also has some loose connections to Russian business_interests according to the including an investment from tech investor Yuri Milner in a real_estate investment company and a friendship with the wife of oligarch Roman Abramovich (She was to the inauguration as Ivanka Trumps guest) Flynn had a number of contacts with Kislyak after Election_Day including attending that meeting between the ambassador and Kushner (Flynn was forced to resign his position after that his comments about the content of those meetings to Vice_President Pence were falsehoods) After resigning from the Defense Intelligence_Agency in 2014 Flynn was invited to give a paid speech at a celebration of RT He did so and joined Putins table for a related banquet The younger Trump visited France last October to to an obscure Russian group In 2008 Don Jr who works for the Trump_Organization told a real_estate conference that Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets and that we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia Manaforts links to Russian interests are New revelations that emerged during the campaign prompted Trump to demand Manaforts resignation Manafort is one of the Trump campaign staffers who made contact with Russian interests during the campaign Before he was confirmed to serve as the head of the State_Department even Republicans Tillersons relationship to Putin As the head of ExxonMobil Tillerson helped negotiate a massive agreement between the Russian_government and a partnership between the two companies Tillerson was subsequently the Order of Friendship by PutinBeing a friend of Vladimir is not an attribute I am hoping for from a MR Marco_Rubio (@marcorubio) Rosss connections to Russian business_interests are less obvious than Tillersons During the Clinton administration Ross served on the board of the an effort to bolster businesses in post-Cold-War Russia During his confirmation questions arose about his ownership of a bank on Cyprus that in the words of caters to wealthy Russians Stones connection to Russia is murky During the campaign he drew attention for seeming to have inside knowledge on the releases that have been linked to Russian interests by the government More directly the Times that Stone is possibly under investigation by the US government for his links to Russia Page is included in that alleged investigation as well but his links to Russia are more clear Page pretty clearly met with Kislyak last_year during the Republican convention in Cleveland as he to MSNBCs Chris Hayes on Thursday night He also has repeatedly Russian business groups in that country including twice in 2016 Over a decade_ago he worked in Russia as an investment banker Page is far in the outer orbit of Trumps circle serving briefly as part of Trumps national_security advisory team Hes joined there by Gordon a onetime Pentagon spokesman who also served as an adviser to the campaign Gordon like Page spoke with Kislyak in ClevelandThis document should be considered a work in progress As more information is released it (and the graphic) will be updated Again none of the relationships above are intended to show misbehavior by those involved The broad question at stake is the extent to which Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 election and if it did the extent to which it may have leveraged relationships with Trumps team to that end That much-bigger question is much harder to evaluateWhen President Trump took the oath of office his administration on the website replacing former president_Barack Obamas policy goals with new prioritiesBut at_least one page remains that allows the people to call on the White_House to take action on the issue that matters to youAnd the people apparently want to see Trumps tax_returns created Friday asks the administration to immediately release Donald Trumps full tax_returns and says it wants Trump to not be in conflict with the Emoluments Clause of the ConstitutionThe unprecedented economic conflicts of this administration need to be visible to the American people including any pertinent documentation which can reveal the foreign influences and financial interests which may put Donald Trump in conflict with the emoluments_clause of the Constitution the petition says Less than a day after the petition was created it eclipsed the enough to elicit an official response from the White_House at_least according to the Obama-era promise that remains on the petitions pageKellyanne Conway a senior adviser to Trump issued a response on national television Sunday morningThe White_House response is that hes not going to release his tax_returns she told George Stephanopoulos on ABCs This Week We litigated this all through the election People didnt care they voted for him And let me make this very clear most Americans are very concerned with what their tax_returns will look like while President Trump is in office not what his look likeAs A Post-ABC poll last_week showed that Trumps continued refusal to release his tax_returns continues to be an unpopular decision with 74 percent of Americans saying he should make the documents public including 53 percent of RepublicansPresidents Wagner noted are not required to release their tax_returns but presidents dating back to Richard Nixon have routinely done so voluntarilyThere were a handful of other petitions created during inauguration weekendalso focuses on Trumps money demanding he divest or put in a blind_trust all of the Presidents business and financial assets One asked Trump to Another sought the repeal of the removing restrictions on gun ownership Oh and some people But by far the most popular petition was the one demanding Trumps tax_returns As of Monday morning it had been signed by more_than 250000 peopleIt seeks documentation about foreign influences and financial interests that could put Trump in conflict with the Emoluments ClauseThe little-known constitutional provision prohibits a president from accepting a gift or a benefit from a foreign leader It was drafted by the Founding Fathers to prevent the leaders of the fledgling United_States from being under the financial thumb of a foreign country like France or EnglandBut Trumps critics say the billionaire businessman was violating the Constitution the moment he swore an oath to protect and defend itRon Fein the legal director at Free Speech for People that there are several examples of Trump violating the Emoluments Clause including rent paid by the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China for its space in Trump_Tower in New_York and spending by foreign diplomats at the Trump properties including his hotel in Washington a few blocks from his new home Sunday night that a liberal watchdog group says it plans to file a lawsuit against President Trump in federal court on Monday alleging that he is in violation of the Emoluments ClauseTrump has claimed he would donate profits from foreign business clients to the US Treasury although he hasnt said exactly how hed track collect and disburse such payments according to GoldAnd even if hes found to be in violation of the Emoluments Clause it is unclear_whether a violation of it qualifies as treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors that could lead to Trumps impeachmentTrumps refusal to release his tax_returns became a heated issue on the campaign trailOn Jan 11 during Trumps first official news_conference since winning the election he continued to resist suggestions to release the returnsThe only ones that care about my tax_returns are the reporters Trump said You learn very little from a tax returnTrump also pointed to an ongoing audit as the reason he couldnt release his tax returnsIm not releasing the tax_returns because as you know theyre under_audit he saidSenior White_House counselor Kellyanne_Conway this week to only one of President Trumps executive_orders namely his temporary ban on refugees and travel from seven Muslim-majority countries and not enough to the many others Trump has signed since taking officeSo Seth Meyers did just thatOn Tuesdays Late Night With Seth Meyers the comedian used a segment called The Check In to delve into a less-discussed executive_order specifically one with a few exceptionsThe order arguably been covered less_than Trumps travel_ban possibly in part because it has not triggered numerous protests and lawsuits nor does its fate rest with Nevertheless Meyers persistedThe stated that no vacant positions existing at noon on January 22 2017 may be filled and no new positions may be created except in limited circumstances Military personnel and other positions deemed necessary to meet national_security or public safety responsibilities were exemptedIn his segment Tuesday Meyers pointed out that the hiring freeze seemed to run counter to one of Trumps most frequent campaign promises that he can fix the problems with how poorly the Department of Veterans Affairs was run And hes right about that For many years now under both Bush and Obama many parts of the VA have been found guilty of fraud and of providing shoddy health_care to our veterans Meyers said Now one of the main problems at the VA is that many departments including VA hospitals are chronically understaffed But one of Trumps first moves as president was to put a freeze on federal hiringMeyers cut to footage of White_House press_secretary Sean_Spicer saying that the focus on VA staffing was overblown and that hiring more people was not the answerHiring more people is not the answer Meyers said sarcastically Unless the question is Where are all the (expletive) people Does anyone work here Meyers also noted that the hiring freeze had the potential to hurtveterans in another way since they receive a preference in federal hiringAs on the day the executive action was signedVeterans who make up 31percent of the federal workforce could also be disproportionately affected by the move because they receive a hiring preference when it comes to federal jobs One unit of the Pentagon according to an official who asked for anonymity to discuss personnel matters is in the process of hiring between 20 and 30 veterans and is now looking at whether to put the hires on holdDepending on how the exemptions are interpreted according to New_York University public service professor Paul Light the freeze might affect fewer than 800000 employees or more_than one-fifth of the overall federal workforceA lot of the people affected by this freeze are people who served this country people for whom Trump promised to fight Meyers said And instead hes making it harder for them to assimilate back to civilian life by in some cases taking away their ability to work In the rest of the segment Meyers summarized Trumps complicated history with veterans issues He opened by cycling through a handful of clips of Trump talking_about veterans throughout his campaignThe vets Oh those vets I love those vets Were_going to take care of those vetsIve worked hard for the vetsTheres nobody bigger or better at the military than I amMeyers did credit Trump for to help build a Vietnam veterans memorial in New_York City But Meyers also reminded viewers that cutting to another clip in which Trump explained I had a foot thingDuring his transition Trump was criticized for his lack of outreach to veterans groups Meyersmentioned a December post fromveterans advocate Paul Rieckhoff who was frustrated at the time that the president-elect had managed to fit rapper Kanye West into his schedulebut no major veterans groupsWow Time for Kanye But still a month after the election and no time for a single leader from a national veterans service organization Paul (PJ) Rieckhoff (@PaulRieckhoff) Meyers brought his Tuesday segment full circle by commenting on Trumps numerousexecutive orders in generalThis whole thing is just another example of Trump signing these executive_orders in haste without thinking about the consequences and in turn leaving a trail of chaos Meyers said You_know at first I thought he was just showing off his signature but now I_think hes going Hey could someone read this to me I feel like it might be a terrible ideaThe World Health Organization announced its first list of antibiotic-resistant priority pathogens on Monday detailing 12 families of bacteria that agency experts say pose the greatest threat to human health and kill millions of people every yearThe list is divided into three categories prioritized by the urgency of the need for new antibiotics The purpose is to guide and promote research and development of new drugs officials saidMost of the pathogens are among the nearly two dozen antibiotic-resistant microbes that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned in a could cause potentially catastrophic consequences if the United_States didnt act quickly to combat the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant infectionsThis list is not meant to scare people about new superbugs said Marie-Paule Kieny an assistant director-general at WHO Its intended to signal research and development priorities to address urgent public_health threats Superbugs that the WHO considers the highest priority are responsible for severe infections and high mortality rates especially among hospitalized patients in intensive care or using ventilators and blood catheters as well as among transplant recipients and people undergoing chemotherapy While these pathogens are not widespread the burden for society is now alarming she saidIncluded in this highest-priority group is CREor carbapenem-resistant which US health officials have dubbed In some instances it kills up to 50 percent of patients who become infected An elderly Nevada woman who died last_year contracted an infection caused by CRE that was resistant to allavailable in the United StatesAlso in the first-tier group is the infections tied to it typically occur in ICUs and settings with very sick patients The other bacteria tagged as a critical prioritywhich can be spread on the hands of health-care workers or by equipment that gets contaminated and is not properly cleanedWHOs list follows that world leaders held last fall only the fourth time they had addressed a health issue at the UN General Assembly The lists second and third tiers the high and medium priority categories cover bacteria that cause more common diseases such as and food poisoning caused by salmonella While not associated with significant mortality rates they have a dramatic health and economic impact particularly in low-income countries Kieny saidAlthough there has been renewed interest and in antibiotics because of the growing threat that antibiotic resistance poses much of the work is more focused on antibiotics with a broad range she saidWe have to focus specifically for a much smaller range of bacteria targeting the three highest-priority pathogens Kieny saidDrug companies have also tended to focus more on Gram-positive bacteria that tend to colonize the skin of healthy individuals and generate less resistance said Evelina Tacconelli who heads the infectious diseases division at the University of Tbingen in Germany which helped develop the WHO list By comparison Gram-negative bacteria more frequently colonize intestinal reservoirs and can cause sepsis and severe urinary tract infections especially among elderly patients There have been no new classes of antibiotics discovered that have made it to market since 1984 according to the Pew Charitable Trusts antibiotic-resistance project And there arent enough drugs to meet future needs Allan Coukell senior director of health programs at Pew said MondayOf the 40 antibiotics in clinical development in the United_States fewer than half even have the potential to treat the pathogens identified by WHO he said And based on history most of those will fail to reach the clinic for reasons of efficacy or safety So the outlook is grimHistorical data show that generally only one of five drugs that reach the initial phase of testing in humans will receive approval from the Food and Drug AdministrationDeveloping antibiotics to treat highly resistant bacterial infections is especially challenging because only a small number of patients contract these infections and meet the requirements to participate in traditional clinical trialsPublic health experts welcomed the announcement including the need to address the problem in a comprehensive fashionWhile research and development are essential we cannot just discover and develop our way out of this crisis said Helen Boucher an infectious diseases doctor at Tufts University and a spokeswoman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America Prevention the appropriate use of antibiotics and surveillance are all necessary as part of a coordinated approach she saidIn the United_States antibiotic-resistant infections kill an estimated 23000 Americans each year according to the CDC Global estimates are difficult because there is no uniform way to include antimicrobial resistance in causes of death But experts say that drug-resistant infections especially those caused by the WHOs highest-priority pathogens double or triple the risk of deathWe are talking_about millions of people affected Tacconelli saidTuberculosis whose resistance has been growing in recent_years was not included in the list because it is targeted by other dedicated programs WHO saidHere is the list from WHO1 carbapenem-resistant 2 carbapenem-resistant 3 carbapenem-resistant ESBL-producing4 vancomycin-resistant 5 methicillin-resistant vancomycin-intermediate and resistant 6 clarithromycin-resistant 7 spp fluoroquinolone-resistant 8 Salmonellae fluoroquinolone-resistant 9 cephalosporin-resistant fluoroquinolone-resistant10 penicillin-non-susceptible 11 ampicillin-resistant 12 spp fluoroquinolone-resistantunnecessaryOn Jan 7 North_Koreas state media shocked the international_community by announcing the of a hydrogen_bomb test Many international observers in South_Korea and the West whether North_Koreas nuclear_test was actually a hydrogen_bomb like Kim_Jong Un alleged or similar to what it had tested previously Then on Feb 7 North_Korea launched a long-range missile that put a satellite into_orbit seen as a demonstration that the country had ballistic_missiles that can aim those weapons at the WestNorth Korea has clearly tested another nuclear device bringing not just from Western countries but more alarmingly for Pyongyang from its traditional allies Russia and ChinaWhy would North_Korea risk steepened international sanctions at a time when its economy has been ravaged by the worst drought in a centuryHeres why To strengthen Kim_Jong Uns totalitarian grip on power at a time when the regime has been losing its ability to reward loyal elites with revenues derived from and has resorted to violent purges to punish That makes sense when you consider these five factorsKims father Kim Jong-Il took power relatively easily in 1994 Thats because he had been heir-apparent as early as 1980 gradually gaining authority_over the North_Korean military But Kims takeover in December 2011 was relatively sudden because he was only one year before his fathers death As a result the new Dear Leader had very little time to establish his credibility among the ruling elites before taking powerAnonymous accounts from Pyongyang elites recently revealed that many believed Kim has an born out of a lifetime of privilege and shouldnt be leader within the North_Korean military-industrial complex are battling over whether Kims military investments and China policy are the right strategies Some are challenging Kims authority so severely that the regime has begun But thats a short-term Band-Aid not a long-term strategyUsing nuclear_weapons to rally the country has a history In 1962 the Democratic_Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK) hyper-militarization and nuclear_weapons development that would enable the country to defend itself from any US and South_Korean aggression without help from the Soviets or Chinese Since Kim_Il Sung launched North_Koreas nuclear_program in the 1980s North_Korean elites have believed that a boosts the nations international statusThats true not because it demonstrates military might Nuclear tests bring international media attention which boosts North_Korean pride Scott Snyder and Kyung Ae-Park argue in their 2013 book that North_Korean aggression brings the Democratic_Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK) welcome geopolitical recognitionWhen the United_States sends former presidents to engage in diplomatic negotiations with the DPRK regime thats a massive PR victory and boosts Kims status and power State-level diplomatic recognition also contributes greatly to the legitimization of North_Korea Leaders like argue for a North_Korean seat at the bargaining table on nuclear security issues which strengthens Kim reassuring elites that the nation is not entirely isolated internationallySuccessfully testing a hydrogen_bomb strengthens Kims claim to know what hes doing as he invests the nations scarce resources in developing nuclear technology It proves that he can lead Whats more it gives Kim heightened stature as a patriotic hero since neither his father nor his grandfather was able to build and test a hydrogen bombNo one believed North_Koreas official announcement that with the newly tested hydrogen_bomb the DPRK could now And yet the announcement reinforced Kims deeper message The UnitedStates remains a hostile power encircling North_Korea and nuclear_weapons are essential to combat that threatNothing brings a group together like a big bad enemy and thats exactly what does Consolidate elite and popular backing for the regime Thats why the regime has for decades fed the public educational propaganda and state-run news media reports to remind citizens of the proof that America is an ever-threatening enemyThat anti-Americanism runs deep at all levels of society Its part of why even the more independent-thinking elites accept Kims with the West even if that might end sanctions relieve starvation and poverty and bring more international aid Kim reminds them that after Libyan dictator renounced weapons of mass destruction the West backed the colonels overthrow and the nation has been in chaos sinceNorth Korea may depend on China to keep from starving and yet it has recently been extremely belligerent toward its patron as if Kim is proving that money cant buy obedience The DPRKs recent include the January hydrogen_bomb test and the February rocket launchLee Jung Hoon a noted professor of international relations at Seouls Yonsei University contends that China views Kim as an Kim has North_Korea wants to make clear that its an independent ally not its patrons proxy or puppetBut China is stuck It doesnt want putting almost 25 million starving refugees at its border Thats why it keeps pledging and delivering assistance And North_Korea exploits that quite effectively realizing that China has no choice but to support it no matter what In other_words the China-North Korea partnership is a not a genuine allianceBut why would North_Korea launch a nuclear_test and satellite nowMany regional observers believe its because in May Pyongyang will hold a historic the first gathering of ruling party members since 1980 that Kim called a Workers_Party Congress because he wants to formalize authority and power structures Even though Kim retains totalitarian control over the North_Korean state challenges from dissident factions have caused him to reinforce his legitimacy through established political institutionsLee Cheol-woo a member of South_Koreas parliamentary intelligence committee recently argued that North_Koreas hydrogen_bomb test was aimed_at that Kim could celebrate at the Congress rallying the elites so that they will back him as he consolidates powerHeres what all this means Unfortunately North_Koreas recent hydrogen_bomb and missile_tests are not irrational actions by a rogue dictatorship Rather they are strategic moves aimed_at consolidating Kims leadership position domestically Belligerence fuels pro-regime nationalism boosting Kims status so that he can tighten his grip on power Thats why hes willing to antagonize long-time allies and suffer through still more international sanctionsAll of which means that North_Korean aggression will_continue to be one of the most intractable security problems in the Asia-Pacific regionNorth Korea is touting technological progress in its nuclear_program saying after a nuclear_test Friday that it can now produce smaller lighter and diversified nuclear_warheads of higher strike power But it is also making strides in its missile program analysts say advances that could enable it to outsmart missile_defense systems which could make the missiles more attractive to potential customersNorth Korea conducted what it called a nuclear_warhead explosion test Friday The country has conducted only five nuclear_tests since its program began but this is the third since Kim_Jong Un took power at the end of 2011 and its second this year Under Kims leadership North_Korea has also sharply accelerated the pace of missile testing with almost two dozen launches this year alone While many of this years tests have not been successful and there are still many unknowns about North_Koreas nuclear and missile_programs there have still been noticeable and concerning improvementsIt seems like North_Korea is trying to qualitatively improve its missiles and develop options to evade or fool US missile defenses said director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association If this continues unchecked they could develop an_intercontinental ballistic_missile that could pose a threat to the United_States in the next decadeIn North_Korea launched three medium-range missiles Monday as China which had joined the international condemnation of last months submarine-launched_ballistic missile was hosting the Group of 20 summit in HangzhouThe rockets flew about 600_miles putting Hangzhou within range But they were sent in the other direction falling inside_Japans air defense identification zoneArms control experts have since been poring over photos of the launches released by the North_Korean media shows three missiles being launched in the space of a minute from trucks parked on a highway south of Pyongyang The location is within the security belt protecting Kim and the other regime elites in the capital said Michael Madden editor of the website That meant the drills could be simulating the collapse of the state or the presence of hostile forces within the country he said by on But it was the modifications to the missile that surprised the rocket scientists at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation_Studies in Monterey Calif It appears that North_Korea has extended the distance a short-range Scud can fly making it halfway between a Scud and a medium-range missile which the North_Koreans call the Rodong That means that a longer-range missile could be wheeled out on an existing Scud transporter obviating the need to produce new trucks Syria is among the countries thought to have bought short-range Scuds from North_Korea in about 2000This is a really nice upgrade said director of the East_Asia Nonproliferation Program in Monterey Countries looking to buy North_Korean missiles are probably looking at this and thinking Ooooh thats niceNorth Korea has been concentrating on developing road-mobile missiles that can be fueled in a shelter or tunnel instead of on a traditional launchpad that can be detected by satellites and theoretically invite a preemptive strikeJapans self-defense forces did_not detect Mondays launch in advance the Nikkei newspaper reported It said this underscored the limits of Japans traditional defense capability programIn the past when activity was seen around the launchpad Japans self-defense forces would roll out Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) interceptors at the Defense_Ministry headquarters in Tokyo But road-mobile missiles can be readied for launch in a matter of minutes cutting the time available to respondJapan is very concerned that North_Korea has launched so many different missiles in such a short period said Atsuya Tanimoto of the Japanese Defense Ministrys intelligence analysis office North_Korea is improving its technology he said(Korean Central Television)North Korea also appears to be looking for other ways to avoid interception no_doubt motivated by South_Koreas recent decision to host a Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defense_(THAAD) antimissile unit for the US military The battery is due to be deployed to a site south of Seoul next yearBut by firing the three missiles within the space of a minute rather_than over the usual course of an hour or so North_Korea appeared to be testing a way to make it more difficult to intercept incoming missiles said chief analytics officer at AllSource Analysis a Colorado-based consultant groupThis launch was probably designed to test not only operational readiness but to develop tricks to defeat antimissile defenses in Japan and South_Korea Bermudez said When you launch in a barrage at the same_time it complicates missile_defense So theyve shown they have not just the technological capability but the operational capability for simultaneous launchesFurthermore it appeared that the missile tested Monday separates after launch making it harder for missile_defense systems to interceptWhen a solid warhead remains attached to the missile its easier to hit because its a bigger target Lewis said If you were in Egypt staring at Israel you might really like a warhead like thisNorth Korea has not demonstrated any capacity to make a nuclear_warhead small enough to attach to a missile let alone the ability to deliver a nuclear-tipped missile to a targetStill the progress in its medium-range missile program follows observable advances in North_Koreas quest to launch missiles from sea as well as from land North_Korea was ridiculed for apparently Photoshopping a ballistic_missile launch from a submarine in May But last_month it successfully launched a missile from a submarine near its east coast port of Sinpo It flew about 300 miles toward Japan before falling into the seaThis showed that its missile program might be progressing faster than originally expected said John Schilling an aerospace engineer who studies North_Koreas missilesHowever this does_not mean it will be ready next week next month or even next year he for the 38 North websiteBut North_Koreas submarine-launched_ballistic missiles could be operational by the second half of 2018 he wroteConcurrent with making progress on its delivery systems North_Korea has also been refurbishing its old missile production infrastructureKim has toured the January 18 General Machinery Plant which makes sensitive missile components several_times over the past_year During one visit he joked that it looked so good that visitors might think they were in a resort International sanctions_imposed through the United_Nations as well as direct sanctions from the United_States South_Korea and Japan have been designed to cut_off North_Koreas ability to buy parts for its nuclear and missile_programs as well as stanch financial flowsBut the steady rat-a-tat of missile_tests suggests that North_Korea has plenty of missile parts to play withSome American officials suggest that North_Korea might be racing against the clock trying to test and make as much progress as it can before the latest round of sanctions really bitesWhile Bermudez warned against getting too excited about the most recent developments saying they simply reinforce what had been seen previously Lewis said the developments should disabuse anyone of the notion that North_Korea was not serious about its missile programTheyre testing at a really fast rate because the program is real he said The idea that this is a Potemkin missile program is just nonsenseFake news identity theft Former Ms World Laura Hunter says she was turned into Gregory McCray (@g_mccray) The Conservative_Daily Post has a simple business model according to court_documents use blood-boiling stories to

or Bill_Clintons involvement in an illicit sex ring She frequently pointed out just how distrustful the American mainstream media wasThe stories all of which happened to be articles from the Conservative_Daily Post were mostlyuntruea lawsuit says But they apparently seemed plausible to their target audience of conservative readers who widely shared many of the storiesHunter posted and the rumor-busting websites have debunked a few of the sites claims that have attracted a massive number of readersOne phony story claimed that the evidence for another story about an underground Clinton sex network was thinHunter it turns out is a real person though not the person her Facebook avatar led thousands to believe she was according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of the real Laura HunterThe suit filed in district court in Nevadas Clark County claims that the news site misappropriated Hunters name to transform her into a spokesperson for a radical right-wing website that peddles fake newsShes seeking compensatory damages and an injunction against the Conservative_Daily Post and an affiliated Facebook page using the name Conservative_Daily ReviewDefendants know that they have turned Ms Hunter into a Conservative online muck slinger of fake_news said the lawsuit And they must answer for itThe viewpoints expressed on the fake_news website are diametrically opposed to what [Hunter] believes her attorney Marc Randazza told The Washington PostTheyre not just cranking out problematic content he said but then theyre taking somebody and making them the face of it She just wants to clear her nameThe real Laura Hunteris a Washington state resident who The television actress and model has owned a photography business for 20 years according to the siteShes also politically left of center her attorney says not the conservative Tennessee pundit that the Conservative_Daily Post claimedShe came face-to-face with her Internet alter ego in October after an email from a man named Michael Powell according to the lawsuit Powell said he ran an advertising agency in Las_Vegas and had a client who wanted to use Hunters head shot from a few years agoBut he dodged Hunters efforts to talk by phone according to court documentsIn another email he asked her to send more head shots ostensibly so he could persuade his client to use themWorried by the confusing conversations Hunter Googled herself The top return linked to the conservative activists page on FacebookThats when Hunter says she realized Powell had turned her persona into a highly rated spokesperson for a right wing political website called the Conservative_Daily ReviewAs she sleuthed around online Hunter noticed that the website contained the same photo Powell said he wanted to use in his original emailBeneath it was a bogus autobiography which has since been deletedLaura Hunter is a well-known blogger and political activist known for her constant stream on Facebook She has been in the

Powell is the president of Gravitas which owns the site according to court_documents The other men are listed as executive officersSince the lawsuit was filed Hunters picture has disappeared from the Facebook page In its place a cartoon image of a brunette woman with hazel eyesMany of the old clips written in her name have been documented in Hunters lawsuit which claims Powell and others had a sophisticated fake_news operation with a sizable staff Randazza saidThe proliferation of fake_news hit its apex during the 2016_presidential election mixed in with a steadychurn of political news and stories about the candidatesFor some it serves obvious political aims But others have made thousands hawking bogus stories to people seen as both gullible and hyperpartisanAs The Washington_Posts There are a lot of variables that factor into exactly how_much a viral hoax story can make for its creator But if you take Facebook shares as an indirect indicator of how widely viewed some of these sites might be you start to understand why if optimized properly fake-news sites targeting hyperpartisan audiences can be lucrativeOne prolific fake_news writer that he makes $10000 a month from Googles Adsense A 23-year-old recent graduate from Davidson College that he churned out fake_news from his home office in Maryland and made about $1000 an hourFacebook and to a lesser extent Twitter are a big part of the fake_news business model according to Alexios Mantzarlis who headsPoynters International Fact-Checking Network A person with a viewpoint and a personality even a fake one isa better driver of traffic to a page than the publications brand account Mantzarlis said No one really knows these websites as their own things This is stuff that primarily shows up on news feedsMantzarlis said fake_news website are often built to churn out stories as quickly as possible which can lead to troubling mistakesIm not surprised Ive seen the stock pictures used and taken all the time This isnt rocket science Mantzarlis told The Washington_Post Fake news sites create content as fast as they can to get as much money as they can They dont do as much research or any research for their stories so they wouldnt do a lot of research when creating these Facebook personalitiesThe ethics of fake_news aside Randazza said hes amazed that no one at the company thought using Hunters name and face could end in legal troubleAt least in a lot of the cases that I get involved in you can at_least look at it and understand the logic behind some of the poor decisions he said Here I just dont knowThis liberal fantasy on steroids arrives courtesy of a satirical newssite designed to dive deeply under the skin of President Trump and anyone who supports himThe site channels the Onions humor the National Enquirers whacked-out headlines and the Huffington Posts progressive indignation Its a parody-based parallel universe whose creator intended for it to serve as a trap for Trump supporters online with a mocking masthead that says President Hillary_Rodham ClintonIn recent_days and singled out the site as fake_news and a place for liberals to seek refuge from realityThe sites founder a 30-year-old East Coast writer who asked spoke on the condition of anonymityfor fear of becoming a conservative targetin real life told The Washington_Post that her conservative critics are partially correct Hillarybeattrump is meant to serve as a refuge from reality for liberalsBut mostly she said its a chance to troll the opposition whose party actually won the presidencyI wanted it to be a joyful middle finger the sites founder said when reached by phone I didnt want to wallow or argue with people who cant be argued with Theres something about humor as confrontation that I instinctively thought would work like a good right jab that I could keep using The joke it would seem is not hard to get even when the joke is just barely a joke Using humor as protest the site operates according to the plainly stated position that Clinton is in fact the 45th president of the United StatesIn the midst of a Constitutional crisis this is our response the sites About Us page states Long live the true president Hillary_Rodham ClintonHow does she respond to critics who accuse her of perpetuating fake newsI empathize with people who feel frustrated that things they see on Facebook do not reflect reality as they see it she said But no I dont_think anyone can accuse me of misinforming the public en masse or undermining the collective intelligence of publics political discourse by writing fake_news that is so obviously satireShe decided to launch the site in January as a defense of Clintons legacy and now has five other writers providing additional content Although fake the stories often highlight Clintons actual policy positions such as raising the federal minimum_wage and guaranteeing paid maternity and paternity leaveThe sitealso serves to remind Trump supporters that the actual president lost the popular_vote to the fake president by enough voters to populate the city of Chicago a fact Trump has falsely If her bulging inbox of violent and misogynistic hate mail is any indication the bait appears to be working with some unsettling results Since Hillarybeattrumporg was picked_up on the conservative-media radar the sites creator says its been getting about 200000 visitors per day enough to keep her busy deleting angry emails for a solid hour each nightIn recent_days she said news about the site bubbled up on 4chan and various subreddits before appearing on the Daily Caller and then Breitbart and Fox_News The entire journey from the fringes of the conservative map to the news spotlight took about 12 hours she saidNow as if on cue the furious email stream gushes any time she publishes a post that identifies Clinton as presidentYou can always find your paradise in heaven one reader said in an email the sites founder shared with The_Post Its just one bullet awayI know in your fake world she won but in the real world she did_not another reader said To the people who made this Web page go get a real job like the rest of real AmericansYour dad must have abused you while mom watched right another reader added YES Liberalism IS A METAL DISORDER and YOU ARE POOFThe founder said the vitriolic reaction says less about her content than it does about her new readersI think it has to be a deep sense of insecurity and I_think they also cant abide by dissent she saidIve been amazed by how willfully determined they are not to get the joke she added Browsing the site the notion of Clinton as commander in chief can feel temporarily realHeadlines regularly note the first female presidents skyrocketing approval ratings (89 percent according to one recent bulletin) new executive_orders furthering liberal causes and grammatically correct tweetsConservative media has blasted the headlines as a sort of pathetic alternative reality for bitter liberal snowflakes to the site as the ultimate safe space and said it offered Clinton supporters a place they can pretendThe websites tagline is News From The Real America Where The Majority Rules a reference of course to the oft-cited notion that the popular_vote actually means something Know a Clinton supporter who cant accept that Trump is the president Well theres a new satirical website just for them FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) https//twittercom/Brn2Wander1/status/834017335669358593htt r insane Special twitter & webpage for those who BELIEVE Crooked H is president Joey (@Vinny58222672) The sites founder seems to revel in the attention albeit anonymouslyFor a lot of people who feel like an important chapter was stolen from feminist history by the Russians by Julian Assange and by the FBI_director hillarybeattrumporg is restorative she saidShe devotes about 35 hours a week to the site and said she plans to keep it going as long as she can summon the energy though shes not making any money and considers it a labor of love Because Clinton offered decades of detailed policy prescriptions many of which will remain at the center of political discourse for years shell have no shortage of material to work with moving forward she saidIf hillarybeattrumporgs audience keeps growing through hate clicks or otherwise the sites founder might launch a YouTube spinoff perhaps a nightly newscast with headlines from Clintons first term in officeAlong the way of course she plans to continue to remind her readers that she believes the wrong person is in the White_House she saidIm unwilling to concede the legitimacy of this president she said I will_continue to gleefully sadistically emphasize Clintons landslide victory in the popular_vote on the site to underline the point that this Trump fellow has no business being presidentTwo senior members of President Trumps national_security team told lawmakers Monday that they believe they have the legal authority to conduct operations against terrorist groups including the Islamic_State and said there was no need for a new war authorization to replace the one passed immediately after the Sept 11 2001 attacks Secretary of State_Rex Tillerson and Defense_Secretary Jim_Mattis also told the Senate Foreign_Relations Committee that any attempt to place time limits or geographical constraints in a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force could cripple efforts to fight terrorists Some lawmakers have said Congress needs to update laws that have provided authority to fight terrorist groups and detain militants including al-Qaeda and the Islamic_State on multiple continents If Congress decides to go ahead and write an updated law Tillerson and Mattis said lawmakers should not constrain the militarys ability to go after terrorists anywhere in the worldThemeans it will attempt to burrow into new countries and find safe havens said Tillerson using an acronym for the Islamic_State Our legal authorities for heading off a transnational threat like ISIS cannot be constrained by geographic boundaries Otherwise ISIS may reestablish itself and gain strength in vulnerable spacesMattis told the committee that time restrictions would also undermine combat operationsWe cannot put a firm timeline on conflict against an adaptive enemy who could hope that we havent the will to fight as long as necessary said Mattis who also stated that the Pentagon is Lawmakers mentioned the possibility of using military force in crises involving North_Korea Iran and Venezuela as well as the ongoing efforts against militant groups that change their name as often as a rock-and-roll band Mattis saidThe hearing was propelled by the in an apparent ambush as they patrolled in an area with groups loyal to both al-Qaeda and the Islamic StateSome members of Congress were taken aback by the About 800 Americans are based in Niger to run counterterrorism operations and train and advise local troops and hundreds more US forces are in other African countriesLaws enacted in 2001 and 2002 gave the military the legal authority to fight international terrorism Even though the United_States is fighting groups that didnt exist back then including the Islamic_State the legal basis remains sound Mattis said He urged Congress not to repeal existing law at_least without a new authorization already in place The uncertainty accompanying that situation could only signal to our enemies and our friends that we are backing away from this fight he said It would stall our operations immediately reduce allied commitments and support and create significant opportunities for our enemies to seize the initiativeA number of lawmakers said it is time to update the law to be more consistent with current conditions and threats Sen Tim Kaine (D-Va) and Sen_Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) are co-sponsoring a proposal providing new legal authority to combat al-Qaeda the Taliban and the Islamic StateThis is one of the most_important topics the United_States Senate and this committee could ever consider Under what circumstances and legal authorities should the United_States send our men and women into war said Sen Benjamin L Cardin (Md) the top Democrat on the committeeFlake noted that not a single member of the committee was in the Senate when the original war authorizations were signed by President George_W Bush more_than a decade agoCongress needs to weigh in he said We have to make_sure our adversaries and our allies and most importantly our troops know that we speak with one voiceShortly before Tillerson and Mattis started testifying a small_group of protesters in the room chanted Stop endless war before they were evictedThis has been a 16-year struggle said Sen Ron Johnson (R-Wis) I dont_think its going to be over any time soonin the eastern United_States this weekend but that wont stop the clocks from springing forward an hour with the return of daylight_saving timeAt 2 am Sunday (March 12) the clocks move ahead one hour and we leave standard time behind While the time shift costs us an hour of sleep evenings will be noticeably brighter again reminding us that the long bright days of spring are just around the cornerAfterthe time switch the sun will set around 7 pm or later in most parts of the countryFor manythe later sunset means no more commuting home in the dark and enough daylight for a round of golf or an evening runin the parkHere in Washington DC sunset will shift from 611 pm to 712 pm after DST begins on SundayCities straddling the western edge of time zones will enjoythe latest sunsets for example Atlanta or Indianapolis but theyll also have to contend with especially dark mornings these next few_weeks In Indianapolis Sundays sunrise isnt until 8 amOne of the biggest arguments against daylight_saving time besides is the reduction in morning light after moving the clocks ahead Some argue that DST since they have to go to school in the darkWhile its true that daylight_saving time steals light from the morning many people forget that the sun will_continue to rise earlier for the nextthree months The arrival of spring means daylight is now increasing at its most rapid pace of the year which means that by mid-April sunrise will have caught up to where it was before DST beginsIn Washington DC sunrise shifts from 625 am to 723 am after we spring forward By April 19 sunrise will again be at 625 am as shown in the chart belowThe highera cityslatitude the more quickly sunrise catches up tothe same_time as it occurredbefore DST began Interestingly the dark mornings that result from daylight_saving time are more pronouncedin the southern tier where daylight changes more slowlythroughout the year In Miami for example it takes until mid-May for sunrise to return to the same_time it occurred before the time changeSwitching the clocks continually reignites debate about the but its easy to forget that doing sohelps redistribute daylight to moreuseful hours of the day If we were to scrap DST entirely and stay on standard time all year it would already be getting light around 5 am in late April and in many places as early as 4 am come JuneOf course whether you love or hate daylight_saving time More evening light is welcomed if you live in the eastern part of a time zone (such as Massachusettsor Maine) At the western edge of a time zone (Indiana or Michigan) daylight_saving time robs residentsof already scarce morning daylightAs long as DST remains in usethe century-old practice will_continue to have its supporters and detractors No one likes losing an hour of precious time and sleep but its a price worth paying for that extra hour of evening sunshineIn addition to charges_against President Trumps former campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort that were released on Monday there was another unexpected development in the investigation_into Russian_meddling in the 2016 electionGeorge Papadopoulos identified in March_2016 as an adviser to the Trump campaign during an_interview with admitted to having provided false_statements to the FBI about his interactions with individuals tied to the Russian_government Papadopouloss credentials as a foreign-policy adviser were questioned immediately by observers a 2009 college graduate his LinkedIn page included his work with model United_Nations as an honor and awardAccording to a document unsealed by the FBI on Monday Papadopoulos admits to having been contacted by Russian agents shortly_after being identified as a campaign adviser contacts that continued for months After being arrested in July he then meets with authorities multiple times to answer_questions details revealed only once the Manafort indictment is made publicBelow a timeline of what the Papadopoulos learns that he will serve as an adviser to Trumps campaign (The timing isnt clear it may have been a day before or after this date) While in Italy Papadopoulos meets a professor based in London who is initially uninterested in Papadopoulos until Papadopoulos explains that hes working for Trumps campaign Papadopoulos is interested in the professor because the professor has links to the Kremlin which Papadopoulos believed would be useful in bolstering his position with the campaign Hillary_Clinton campaign_chairman John_Podesta is sent an email including a fraudulent link to change his Google password Its believed that this email was sent by an agent of the Russian_government and was used to illegally access his email account Trump meets with The_Post and several campaign advisers including Papadopoulos Papadopouloss credentials are quickly Papadopoulos and the professor meet in London They are joined by a woman who claims to be a niece of Russian President_Vladimir Putin The purpose of the meeting he later writes in an email to the Campaign Supervisor and several members of the Campaigns foreign_policy team (per the statement) is to arrange a meeting between Trump and PutinWho the campaign supervisor is isnt clear At that point the Trump campaign is being managed by Corey_Lewandowski In August The_Post that Sam_Clovis a campaign co-chairman who worked with the foreign_policy team had rejected the idea of a meeting over the short termWe thought we probably should not go forward with any meeting with the Russians until we have had occasion to sit with our NATO_allies he wrote in an emailFrom our reportIn the same email chain [adviser Navy Rear Adm Charles] Kubic the retired admiral reminded others about legal restrictions on meetings with certain Russian officials adding Just want to make_sure that no one on the team outruns their headlights and embarrasses the campaign Manafort is hired to manage the Trump campaigns delegate process At a campaign national_security meeting in Washington (also attended by Trump) Papadopoulos tells the group that he had connections that could facilitate a meeting with PutinTrump tweeted an image from the meeting Jeff_Sessions then a senator from Alabama is seated in the foreground and is speaking Papadopoulos is sitting two chairs to Sessionss left Trump is at the head of the table Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Papadopoulos emails the foreign_policy team to update them about ongoing discussions with the professor and Putins_niece He details his outreach to RussiaAt some point this month the Democratic_National Committees server is illegally accessed by hackers believed to be connected to the Russian_government Its the second such intrusion the first occurred in the summer of 2015 In an email_exchange with the niece and the professor Papadopoulos mentions trying to set_up a potential foreign_policy trip to Russia The professor replies that it has already been agreed and mentions that hell be in Moscow later that month for meetings at the Russian Duma and a Valdai meeting (There is on April 19 that Mifsud attended)The niece replies I have already alerted my personal links to our conversation and your request As mentioned we are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr Trump The Russian Federation would love to welcome him once his candidature would be officially announced During the period that the professor says hell be in Russia he introduces Papadopoulos over email to a Russian who has connections with the Ministry of Foreign_Affairs Later from The_Post indicates that this may be Ivan Timofeev of the Russian International_Affairs Council Papadopoulos and the MFA connection (as the statement describes this person) have multiple conversations over Skype and email about setting_up a meeting between the campaign and government officials The MFA connection and Papadopoulos discuss meetings in Moscow or London Papadopoulos and the professor meet in London At that meeting the professor tells Papadopoulos that while in Moscow he learned that the Russians had obtained dirt on then-candidate [Hillary] Clinton Per Papadopoulos the professor said that They have dirt on her the Russians had emails of Clinton they have thousands of emails Papadopoulos emails a senior campaign staffer to indicate that hes gotten some interesting messages He also emails a high-ranking campaign official to reiterate that Putin would like to host Trump The Posts August report indicates that the high-ranking official who was told about Putin wanting to meet was Lewandowski Papadopoulos emails the professor to thank him for his help saying that its history making if the meeting happens The MFA connection emails PapadopoulosI have just talked to my colleagues from the MFA it reads The[y] are open for cooperation One of the options is to make a meeting for you at the North America Desk if you are in MoscowPapadopoulos forwards this to Lewandowski and the next_day to the campaign supervisor who is probably Clovis Lewandowski doesnt reply Clovis says [t]here are legal issues we need to mitigate meeting with foreign officials as a private citizen Papadopoulos emails another high-ranking campaign official Manafort according to The Posts August report informing him that Russia has been eager to meet Mr Trump for quite sometime and have been reaching_out to me to discussManafort forwards the email to Rick_Gates (who was also indicted on Monday) We_need someone to communicate that [Trump] is not doing these trips he writes It should be someone low_level in the campaign so as not to send any signal Papadopoulos tries to set_up an off-the-record meeting between the campaign and Russian officials possibly including himselfThe Russian ministry of foreign affairs messaged and said that if Mr Trump is unable to make it to Russia if a campaign rep (me or someone else) can make it for meetings he emails a campaign official on June 19 I am willing to make the trip off the record if its in the interest of Mr Trump and the campaign to meet specific peopleThe meeting never happens WikiLeaks begins releasing emails stolen from the DNCDuring a news_conference Trump that Russia probably [has] her 33000 emails referring to emails deleted by Clinton after her service in the State_Department because her lawyers didnt believe them to be related to her tenure WikiLeaks begins releasing emails stolen from Podesta Papadopoulos is interviewed at the FBI During that interview he makes false_statements about the above interactions He claims The FBI interviews him again Papadopoulos deactivates his Facebook account It had included information about his conversations with the professor Robert Mueller is appointed as special_counsel to investigate Russian_meddling in the election Papadopoulos is arrested at Dulles Airport in Washington Papadopoulos [meets] with the Government on numerous occasions to provide information and answer_questions Hot Air that references to Papadopoulos in a request to seal his statement as a proactive cooperator matches a description used for witnesses who wear wires as part of investigations Papadopoulos admits that the statements he gave the FBI are false and agrees to the timeline and details above The statement of offense is unsealed the same_day that indictments against Manafort and Gates are made publicSouth Korea abruptly shut_down an industrial complex just over the border in North_Korea on Wednesday cutting off a major source of income for the regime in Pyongyang as punishment for its extremely provocative In an unusually harshly worded statement Seoul flatly accused the North of using money made from inter-Korean projects for its nuclear and missile programsAbout $120 million flowed into North_Korea through the Kaesong industrial complex last_year alone the Souths Unification Ministry said In the 12 years since the complex was established North_Korea had made a total of about $560 million from the siteIt appears that such funds have not been used to pave the way to peace as the international_community had hoped but rather to upgrade its nuclear_weapons and long-range missiles the ministry said As a result President Park Geun-hyes government said it had completely shut_down the complex But the Unification Ministry statement said the international_community needed to come up with a vigorous response to a recent nuclear_test and rocket_launch that exacts a price for North_Koreas misguided actions as well as extraordinary measures that compel North_Korea to give up its nuclear capabilities and change its waysSeparately Japan on Wednesday announced new unilateral economic sanctions on North_Korea in response to the tests banning North_Korean citizens from coming into Japan and North_Korean ships from calling at Japanese ports Transfers of money except for humanitarian gifts of less_than $800 will also be prohibitedMeanwhile South_Koreas Yonhap news_agency reported Wednesday that the North executed its army chief of staff Ri Yong Gil this month for corruption and factional conspiracy If true it would be the latest in a series of executions purges and disappearances under leader_Kim Jong UnLast month North_Korea carried_out its fourth_nuclear test claiming it tested a more powerful hydrogen_bomb but analysts say it was another atomic blast similar to the previous three On Sunday the North launched a rocket that it said carried a satellite into_orbit The West and allies however viewed the launch as another step in developing technology for a ballistic_missile programThe United_States South_Korea and Japan were already leading the charge at the United_Nations to impose another_round of sanctions on North_Korea in response to the nuclear_test when the rocket was launched Immediately after Sundays rocket_launch Parks government said it was on deploying a Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defense_(THAAD) antimissile_system in South_Korea Seoul had been cautious about the move for fear of angering Beijing but the North_Korean tests appeared to have spurred Parks government into actionThe South also increased anti-regime broadcasts into North_Korea through loudspeakers lined up along the demilitarized zone that separates the two countriesCheong Seong-chang a North_Korea specialist at the Sejong Institute outside Seoul said that the South_Korean government appeared to be making emotional decisions when dealing with the Norths provocationsOpening a discussion with the US about THAAD which China and Russia are strongly against means that South_Koreas relations with these two countries will get worse Cheong said But good relations with China and Russia is vital to work on sanctions on North KoreaPlus it would not have the desired impact because North_Korea could just get its workers to produce for Chinese companies he addedCompanies whose factories were shut_down were unhappyIt is unfair and emotional for the government to come to this conclusion without giving the companies any time to minimize possible damages said Chung Ki-sup head of the council of South_Korean companies in Kaesong according to local media reportsAfter similar tests in 2013 the South_Korean government promised that the Kaesong complex would be allowed to operate separately from politics he said We urge the government to review todays decision Chung saidAidan Foster-Carter a Korea analyst based in Britain called shutting down Kaesong stupid short-sighted and inconsistent Soon after Park was elected in 2013 she worked hard to reopen Kaesong after it was closed by the North and both_sides agreed that the two Koreas will not make Kaesong suffer again Foster-Carter saidThat too followed [North Korean] nuclear and missile_tests so why has Park changed her mind done a U-turn and broken a pledge he asked Fifield reported from TokyoIts 2017 When your name catches the attention of a big enough portion of the worlds population an extremely reliable phenomenon follows Peopletry to

financial planner who happens to have the exact same name asGeorge Papadopoulos the former Trump campaign adviser who pleaded_guilty to lying to federal officials earlier_this month When that plea was announced on Monday some people started tweeting at @feeonlyplanner a verified account for one George_Papadopoulos that pops up in a Twitter search That account belongs to the financial planner who also contributes to a Wall_Street Journal blog on wealth management and the former Trump adviser The Trump-connected Papadopoulos doesnt appear to have a verified accountWhen is your court date You

George_Papadopoulos onlineI am visiting my elderly mother in Greece to attend to some of her affairs and of course enjoying her home cooking Papadopoulos told The_Post in an email on Monday afternoon I had finished an amazing lunch dish she prepared for me and wanted to quickly check online how the morning was starting back in the US And then the news hit And the deluge startedAt first he tried to reply to every mistaken tweet but it became apparent pretty quickly that this was not humanely possible he said So he tried to clarify to everyone that he wasnt the guy they were looking forFor the nth time I am NOT Trumps foreign_policy adviser I have NO association with the Trump camp NONE George_Papadopoulos (@feeonlyplanner) But somehow that tweet seemed to trigger another_round of insults from random Twitter users who believed this Papadopoulos was definitely the one who pleaded_guilty and that his tweet was merely an attempt to distance himself from the Trump administrationTrump

(@feeonlyplanner) Good luck GeorgeA Maryland bill that would allow women who become pregnant as a result of a rape to terminate their attackers parental_rights has received key legislative support and after nine years of failed attempts appears likely to be approved next year Senate President Thomas V Mike Miller Jr (D-Calvert) said last_week on social_media that he plans to co-sponsor the bill during the next legislative session which begins in JanuaryI have shared publicly and privately my disappointment that the Rape Survivor Family Protection Act did_not make it to the floor until Sine Die and did_not pass the Legislature in time Miller Senate Democratic leadership is going to make clear this [is] a priority and the bill will be taken up early Miller said he would co-sponsor the bill when the legislature reconvenes in January and would make it a top priority to make_sure victims of rape are protected and not forced to co-parent with their rapistEarlier this month House Speaker Michael E Busch (D-Anne Arundel) said he also planned to co-sponsor the bill and said it would be a top priority in the new sessionMontgomery County Democrats Del Kathleen M Dumais and Sen Brian J Feldman have been lead sponsors on the legislation for yearsThis protection is long overdue and victims of sexual_assault need us to take action Busch wrote on FacebookAlmost 25 other states have passed similar laws The Maryland after key members of a conference committee panel could not reach a compromise over the House and Senate versions that two committee chairmen who appointed the conference panel did_not include female lawmakers in the group and waited until the end of the 90-day session to try to resolve the differences in the House and Senate versionsMuch of last years debate on the bill centered around whether an alleged rapist would have to be criminally convicted to have his parental_rights revoked About 20 of the states who have such a bill require a rape conviction before terminating parental rightsAdvocates argued that Maryland allows parental_rights to be terminated in child-abuse cases even when there is no criminal child-abuse conviction The same standard should apply they say in cases of sexual assaultUnder the bill a woman who sought to terminate a mans parental_rights would have to prove through clear and convincing evidence the standard used in civil court that the man had sexually assaulted her The burden-of-proof standard is higher in criminal court where charges must be proved beyond a reasonable doubtWith days left in the 2017 session the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee struck language from the bill that said that courts could not require publication of the name of the mother or child in such cases and added language that said the father could refuse to testify or offer evidence in court The amendment forced the need for the conference committeeJake Weissmann deputy chief of staff for Miller said Monday that there were no details available about a compromise bill just a commitment that were going to get this done Lisae C Jordan executive director of the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assaults said it has

back up Trumps accusation about Obama Trump may have been prompted by a report on the conservative website Breitbart and commentary from talk_radio host Mark Levin suggesting that the Obama_administration used police state tactics to monitor the Trump team The Breitbart report circulated among Trumps senior aides Friday and early Saturday and Trump may have simply been reacting to the piece when he took to his preferred megaphone Twitter to trumpet his claimTrumps tweets punctuated a general feeling shared by the president his advisers and allies that Obama and the Deep State of critics within the intelligence_community who they think are fueling stories on Trump and Russia have been conspiring to derail his presidency At the heart of each of the presidents tweets is Trumps apparent belief that Obama himself as opposed to members of his administration had been personally overseeing surveillance of Trump TowerThe conservative media landscape including Sean Hannitys show on Fox_News and Infowars the conspiracy website run by Alex Jones outlets on which Trump has appeared has in recent_days given birth to tales of Obama and his closest confidants trying to spur

an early evening meeting with Sessions and Homeland_Security Secretary John_F Kelly as well as dinner with both men and other advisers including BannonIf the Foreign_Intelligence Surveillance Court

current and former intelligence officials cast doubt on Trumps wiretapping assertionIts extremely unlikely that there would have been any sort of criminal or intelligence surveillance of Trump said Jennifer Daskal a former senior Justice_Department national_security official Theres_no credible evidence yet to suggest that that happened It would be an extraordinary measure for the FBI to ask for and the court to grant a surveillance order on a presidential_candidate of the opposing party in an election year Most Republican leaders were quiet on the issue Saturday but Sen Lindsey O Graham (R-SC) vowed at a town hall meeting with constituents to get to the bottom of this He said it would be the biggest scandal since Watergate if Obama illegally spied on Trump or if a judge approved a warrant to monitor Trumps campaign for possible communications with RussiaIm very worried that our president is suggesting that the former president has done something illegally Graham said At the same_time because of what it would signal I would be very worried if in fact the Obama_administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity with foreign governmentsSen

there is absolutely no_evidence of that fact she said Jenna Portnoy in Palm_Beach Fla and David Weigel and Matt Zapotosky in Washington contributed to this_reportThe Trump administration has enlisted senior members of the intelligence_community and Congress in efforts to counter news stories about Trump associates ties to Russia a politically charged issue that has been under as well as lawmakers now defending the White HouseActing at the behest of the White_House the officials made calls to news_organizations last_week in attempts to challenge stories about alleged contacts_between members of President Trumps campaign team and Russian intelligence operatives US officials saidThe calls were orchestrated by the White_House after unsuccessful attempts by the administration to get senior FBI officials to speak with news_organizations and dispute the accuracy of stories on the alleged contacts with RussiaThe White_House on Friday acknowledged those interactions with the FBI but did_not disclose that it then turned to other officials who agreed to do what the FBI would not participate in White House-arranged calls with news_organizations including The Washington_Post Two of those officials spoke on the condition of anonymity a practice President Trump has condemnedThe officials broadly dismissed Trump associates contacts with Russia as infrequent and inconsequential But the officials would not answer substantive questions about the issue and their comments were not published by The_Post and do not appear to have been reported elsewhereWhite House spokesman Sean_Spicer confirmed that the White_House communicated with officials with the aim of contesting reporting on Russia but maintained that the administration did nothing improper When informed by the FBI that [the Russia-related reporting] was false we told_reporters who else they should contact to corroborate the FBIs version of the story he said The decision to involve those officials could be perceived as threatening the independence of US spy_agencies that are supposed to remain insulated from partisan issues as well as undercutting the credibility of ongoing Those officials saw their involvement as an attempt to correct coverage they believed to be erroneousThe effort also involved senior lawmakers with access to classified intelligence about Russia including Sen_Richard Burr (R-NC) and Rep_Devin Nunes_(R-Calif) the chairmen of the Senate and House intelligence committees A spokesman for Nunes said that he had already begun speaking to reporters to challenge the story and that at the request of a White_House communications aide Chairman Nunes then spoke to an additionalreporter and delivered the same message Unlike the others Nunes spoke on the record and was subsequently quoted in the Wall_Street JournalIn an_interview Burr acknowledged that he had conversations about Russia-related news reports with the White_House and engaged with news_organizations to dispute articles by the New_York Times and CNN that alleged repeated or constant contact between Trump campaign members and Russian intelligence operatives Ive had those conversations Burr said adding that he regarded the contacts as appropriate provided that I felt I had something to share that didnt breach my responsibilities to the committee in an ongoing investigationThe administrations push against the Russia coverage intensified Sunday when White_House Chief of Staff said in television interviews that he had been authorized by the top levels of the intelligence_community to denounce reports on Trump campaign contacts with Russia as falsePriebuss denunciations ranged from calling the articles overstated to saying they were complete garbageAdministration officials said that Priebuss comments had been cleared by FBI_Director James_B Comey and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe In doing so the FBIs leadership would appear to have been drawing a distinction between authorizing comments by a White_House official and addressing the matter themselves Mark Warner the ranking_Democrat on the Senate_Intelligence Committee said he called CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Burr to express his grave concerns about what this means for the independence of the investigationI am consulting with members of the Intelligence_Committee to determine an appropriate course of action so we can ensure that the American people get the thorough impartial investigation that they deserve free from White_House interference Warner said in a statement Friday nightRep Adam_B Schiff_(Calif) the ranking_Democrat on the House_Intelligence Committee issued a statement Friday evening saying that if the White_House contrived to have intelligence officials contradict unfavorable news reports this represents a new and even more grave threat to the independence of the intelligence communityFormer intelligence officials expressed concern over the blurring of lines between intelligence and politics with some recalling Republican accusations that the Obama_administration had twisted intelligence in its accounts of the 2012 attacks on US facilities in Benghazi LibyaI doubt that there was any enthusiasm from the intelligence leadership to get involved in this in the first place former CIA_director Michael Hayden said noting that it seemed unlikely that Priebuss bluntly worded denials were consistent with the precise language favored by intelligence analystsThink Benghazi here Hayden said in an_interview by email This is what happens when the intel guys are leaned on for the narrative of the political speakers The latter have different rules words purposes Getting intel into that mix always ends unhappily [and] it looks like we just didThe Trump administrations actions reflect its level of concern about coverage of its relationship with Russia Trump has continued to praise Russian President_Vladimir Putin even after US intelligence_agencies concluded that to help Trump winTrump has also repeatedly disparaged the intelligence_agencies that his administration last_week turned to for support Shortly before taking office Trump accused US spy_agencies of a to smear himThe White_House statements on the issue Friday came after CNN reported that the to publicly knock down media reports about ties_between Trump associates and Russian intelligenceAdministration officials disputed the account saying that rather_than soliciting FBI feedback Priebus had been pulled aside by McCabe on the morning of Feb15 and told I want you to know that the New_York Times story is BSThe FBI declined to discuss the matterWhite House officials declined to comment on the administrations subsequent effort to enlist other government officials and would not agree to allow the identification of the intelligence officials who had spoken to The_Post last_week In separate calls those individuals insisted on being identified only as a senior intelligence official in the Trump administration and a senior member of the intelligence communityIn a brief interview on the night of Feb15 the senior intelligence official said that the suggestion that there was frequent contact between Russians and Trump associates was false describing any conversations as sporadic limited and based on Russias interest in building a relationship with the future Trump administration rather_than shaping the 2016_presidential raceThe senior intelligence official appeared to be referring to contacts_between Trumps designated national_security adviser_Michael Flynn and Russian_Ambassador Sergey_Kislyak before Trump was sworn in as president Flynn was forced out of his job earlier_this month after The_Post reported that against Russia with Kislyak and then misled Trump administration officials about the nature of his contactsOfficials at the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on whether senior officials at those agencies had discussed Russia coverage with the White_House or been involved in efforts to refute stories on that subjectCIA Director Mike Pompeo is the senior-most intelligence official in the administration with former senator Dan Coats (R-Ind) still awaiting confirmation as director of national intelligenceAs a Republican member of Congress in the House investigation of Benghazi which centered on accusations that the Obama_administration had twisted intelligence about the attacks for political purposesIt is not unusual for CIA leaders to have contact with news_organizations particularly about global issues such as terrorism or to contest news accounts of CIA operations But involving the agency on alleged Trump campaign ties to Russia could be problematicThe CIA is not in charge of the investigation Given the history of domestic espionage abuses in the United_States CIA officials are typically averse to being drawn into matters that involve US citizens or might make the agency vulnerable to charges that it is politicizing intelligenceA US intelligence official declined to discuss any Pompeo involvement except to say that he was not involved in drafting or approving statements for public use by the White_House this past weekend on alleged Russian contactsWhether there were such contacts remains a major point of contention Beyond Flynn the investigation has focused on other figures including Trumps former campaign_chairman who had previously served as a paid political adviser to the Putin-backed president of UkraineUS intelligence reports cite multiple contacts_between members of Trumps team and Russians with links to the Kremlin during the campaign and afterward according to officials who have seen them Such reports were based on intercepted Russian communications and other sources the officials said Nunes who served as a member of Trumps transition_team has resisted calls for his House committee to investigate alleged contacts_between Trump associates and Russia He said in an_interview that after months of investigations US authorities have turned up no_evidence of such contactsTheyve looked and its all a dead trail that leads me to believe no contact not even pizza-delivery-guy contact Nunes said appearing to rule out even unwitting contact between Trump officials and Russian agents Investigators Nunes said dont even have a lead Philip_Rucker Ellen_Nakashima and Julie_Tate contributed to this reportPresident Trump just backed down from what could have been a serious fight with ChinaOn Thursday evening in Washington he appeared to shy away from confrontation with Beijing by agreeing to honor the one-China_policy during a lengthy telephone call with Chinas President_Xi JinpingThe move is set to ease tensions between the worlds two most_powerful nations relations had been inflamed after Trump suggested he would only commit to the one-China_policy if Beijing addressed his concerns about trade and currency issuesExperts had previously noted with concern that Trump had not spoken to Xi since his inauguration despite speaking or meeting with at_least 18 other world leaders although the two_men did talk by phone days after Trumps election victory In a statement issued late Thursday the White_House said the two_men had held a lengthy and extremely cordial conversationThe two leaders discussed numerous topics and President Trump agreed at the request of President_Xi to honor our one-China_policy the White_House statement saidIn return Xi said he appreciated his US counterpart Donald Trump for stressing that the US government adheres to the one-China_policy which he called the political basis of relations between the two nations state news_agency Xinhua reportedThe development of China and the United_States absolutely can complement each_other and advance together Both sides can absolutely become very good cooperative partners Xi saidThe one-China_policy was first agreed by President Nixon and Chinas leader Mao Zedong in 1972 and formed the bedrock for the establishment of diplomatic ties under President Carter in 1979 It rules out independence and diplomatic recognition for the island of TaiwanTrumps insistence that it was open for negotiation had brought a sharp rebuke from China which insisted the policy was highly sensitive and non-negotiableIt was not clear if Trump had gained any concessions from China in return for endorsing the policy Xinhua said the two_men agreed to strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation in trade economic investment and international affairsMuch more likely experts said Trump might simply have been persuaded that relations would never get off the ground without endorsing the one-China ideaLawyer James Zimmerman former head of the American_Chamber of Commerce in China said Trump never should have raised the one-China_policy in the first place and had now backed down probably because he realized it was a complicated thorny issue that is simply not open for discussion There is certainly a way of negotiating with the Chinese but threats concerning fundamental core interests are counterproductive from the get-go he said The end result is that Trump just confirmed to the world that he is a paper tiger a zhilaohu someone that seems threatening but is wholly ineffectual and unable to stomach a challengeNi Feng deputy director of the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing said Trumps previous comments had sent the relationship between the two countries tumbling and collapsing adding that he believed that was why the phone_call had been delayedWithout acknowledgement of the one-China_policy Sino-US_relations cannot proceed he said No president has ever refused to acknowledge it since the US and China established diplomatic relations in the 70s and no US president has ever created such confusionNow we can say that Sino-US_relations can proceed he saidLv Xiang another Sino-US_relations expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said by mentioning at the request of President_Xi in the White_House statement the United_States might want to show that they still have reservations on the issueHowever Lv said the one China policy had been a very important topic in preliminary conversations leading up to the phone_call The precondition of the call was the basic understanding and acceptance of the one-China_policy he saidForeign Ministry_spokesman Lu Kang would not be drawn on the consultations and negotiations leading up to the call saying only that adhering to the one-China principle is theobligation that any American government should fulfill and adding that theunshaken upholding of this policy is very important for the healthy and stable development of bilateral tiesTaiwans presidential spokesman Huang Chung-yen suggested his administration had been warned in advance that Taipei and Washington have been in close contact and communication regarding this development and continue to take an effective zero surprise approachIn recent_days he said the US administration including Secretary of State_Rex Tillerson hadon multiple occasions reiterated its support for Taiwan The timing of the phone_call also appeared significant coming on the eve of a formal summit between Trump and Japans Prime_Minister Shinzo_Abe set to take_place in Washington on FridayJapan is a historic enemy of China and a key modern-day strategic rivaland Beijing is sure to be watching that summit extremely closely Trump is likely to use the occasion to reinforce his commitment to the mutual defense pact between United_States and Japan a policy that Defense_Secretary Jim_Mattis took pains to underline on a visit to Tokyo last weekIn December following his election and before his transition Trump made waves with a protocol-breaking Tsai Ing-wenIt was the first communication between leaders of the United_States and Taiwan since 1979 and the product of months of preparation by Trumps advisers who advocated for a new strategy of engagement with Taiwan to rattle ChinaAs expected China reacted sternly but then Trump publicly questioned whether the one-China_policy was in the United_States best interestsHe fired off provocative tweets about the Chinese on currency manipulation imports from the United_States and its military buildup in the South China SeaIn December Trump suggested he would use Taiwans status as a bargaining chip telling Fox_News I dont_know why we have to be bound by a one-China_policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things including trade In January shortly_before his inauguration he that he was open to shifting US policy on China and TaiwanEverything is under negotiation including one-China Trump told saidDespite closing its embassy in Taipei in 1979 the United_States remains Taiwans biggest ally and arms supplier and is bound by legislation to provide the means for the island to defend itselfDefeated nationalist forces fled to the island in 1949 after losing a civil_war to the CommunistsThe White_House said representatives from both countries will engage in discussions and negotiations on various issues of mutual interest The two leaders also extended invitations to meet in their respective countries and look_forward to further talks with very successful outcomesThe phone_call to Xi came a day after Trump sent a letter wishing China a prosperous Year of the Rooster sent 11_days after China celebrated its Lunar New Year festival In that letter Trump also said he looked forward to working with Xi todevelop a constructive relationship that benefits both nations the White_House saidOn Wednesday a US Navy P-3C Orion surveillance aircraft was engaged in what the US Pacific Command called an unsafe interaction with a Chinese military KJ-200 aircraft in international airspace over the South China_Sea aircraft We will address the issue in appropriate diplomatic and military channels said Pacific Command spokesman Maj Rob Shuford said in a statement Friday Such incidents are not uncommon though and the two nations militaries have improved communications in recent_years to make them less common and less threateningTalking to the Global_Times newspaper an unnamed Chinese Foreign Minstry official said the incident had taken place

In_addition to Clovis who now serves as senior White_House adviser to the US Department of Agriculture Papadopoulos wrote to campaign_manager Corey_Lewandowski and campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort the newly released documents showThe campaign officials are not identified in court_documents but some of the emails cited by federal_prosecutors match messages described in August to The Washington_Post by people_familiar with their contentsThe newly released documents_show that while senior Trump officials at times rebuffed or ignored Papadopoulos they were well aware of his efforts which went on for months His interactions with them could complicate the White_Houses attempts to distance the president from Papadopoulos who pleaded_guilty Oct 5 to lying to federal agents Trump himself knew of Papadopouloss claims that he had a pipeline to Moscow During a March_2016 meeting of the campaigns national_security advisers in Washington that Trump attended Papadopoulos said he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between the then-candidate and PutinOn Monday White_House press_secretary Sarah_Huckabee Sanders said she was not sure that the president recalls specific details of the meeting calling it brief She described Papadopouloss role with the campaign as extremely limitedIn a statement Cloviss attorney Victoria Toensing said Clovis a radio_host from Iowa who was one of Trumps earliest supporters always vigorously opposed any Russian trip for Donald Trump and/or the campaignShe said Clovis was being polite when he encouraged Papadopoulos to meet with Russian officials in August adding that the campaign had a strict rule that no person could travel abroad as a representative of the campaign Clovis could not stop an American citizen from traveling abroad in

advisers describing him as an energy and oil consultant Excellent guy Papadopoulos was charged under seal in July and was arrested when he arrived at Dulles International Airport on July 27 His plea_agreement indicates that he is cooperating with special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III He pleaded_guilty in October to lying to federal agents about his contacts with people with connections to the Russian_government filings showPapadopouloss efforts to arrange a meeting with Russian officials began days after he was named to Trumps campaign team and continued for months At one point he emailed Lewandowski to discuss Russias interest in hosting Mr Trump Have been receiving a lot of calls over the last_month about Putin wanting to host him and the team when the time is right according to documentsA month later he in an email to ManafortIn response Manafort forwarded Papadopouloss offer to his deputy_Rick Gates writing We_need someone to communicate that [Trump] is not doing these trips It should be someone low_level in the campaign so as not to send any signalManafort spokesman_Jason Maloni told The_Post in August that the campaign chairmans response indicated that any invitation by Russia directly or indirectly would be rejected outright Papadopouloss proposed trip ultimately did_not take_place court_documents show According to court_papers Papadopoulos lied to federal agents about one of his key contacts a London-based professor he met in Italy in March_2016 days after he joined the Trump campaignIn a subsequent meeting in April the professor told Papadopoulos that the Russian_government had dirt on Democratic presidential_candidate Hillary_Clinton including thousands of Clintons emailsThat conversation occurred weeks before the Democratic_National Committee revealed that it had been hacked and believed that Russians were behind the attack It also came about a month after an email account belonging to Clintons campaign_chairman John_Podesta was targeted with a phishing attempt that may have led to the hack of his emails by WikiLeaks in October 2016One email quoted in court_filings regarding the professor matches an exchange previously described to The_Post in which Papadopoulos identified the professor as Joseph Mifsud the director of the London Academy of DiplomacyThat document as well as emails with Clovis and other top campaign aides was among more_than 20000 pages that the Trump campaign turned over to congressional_committees after review by White_House and defense lawyersMifsud told The_Post in an email in August that he had absolutely no contact with the Russian_government and said his only ties to Russia were through academic links He did_not respond to a request for comment MondayWhen asked about the unsealed indictments Monday Kremlin spokesman Dmitry_Peskov said We dont_know what the charges are After being sent a copy of the indictments he responded My office hours are overPapadopoulos also communicated with a Russian woman with ties to the government and a man in Moscow he believed was connected to the Ministry of Foreign_Affairs filings showAt the time Papadopoulos incorrectly believed that the Russian woman was a niece of Putin according to court documentsWe are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr Trump she wrote to him in April_2016 The Russian Federation would love to welcome him once his candidature would be officially announced According to court_filings she told Papadopoulos that she would like to help set_up meetings with her associates to discuss US-Russia ties under a future President TrumpAfter Papadopoulos_emailed campaign officials about her offer Clovis responded that he would work it through the campaign but added Great workToensing described Clovis as a polite gentleman from Iowa who would always have been courteous to a person offering to help the campaignClovis played a key role in boosting Trump during the Iowa caucuses but his influence within the campaign subsequently waned amid tense relations with Trumps_son-in-law and adviser Jared KushnerDuring a Jan 27 2017 interview with FBI_agents Papadopoulos said he had met the Russian woman before he joined the Trump campaign and falsely stated that he had no relationship with her according to court filingsThe day after his second interview with FBI_agents in February Papadopoulos deactivated his Facebook account which had information about his outreach to Russian officials a move prosecutors said was aimed_at obstructing their investigationPapadopoulos who has a scant foreign_policy background briefly advised the 2016_presidential campaign of neurosurgeon Ben CarsonWhen Trump identified Papadopoulos as an adviser in March_2016 the hotel and real_estate executive was rising in the field of Republican presidential candidates and his campaign was eager to show that it had credible voices offering advice on foreign_policy Among the other advisers he named that day was whose ties to Russia have been under_scrutiny Throughout the summer Papadopoulos met with foreign officials and gave interviews to media in other countries sometimes describing Trumps views on Putin or RussiaHe told a group of researchers in Israel that Trump saw Putin as a responsible actor and potential partner according to a column in the Jerusalem Post later he met with a British Foreign Office representative in London and a Greek official in New_York British and Greek embassy spokesmen have said He also criticized US sanctions on Russia in an_interview with the Russian news outlet InterfaxThe Post has also reported that contained in a dossier about Trumps ties to Russia told people around him that he was in contact with Papadopoulos during the campaign Robert Costa Carol D Leonnig and Philip_Rucker in Washington Karla_Adam in London and David_Filipov in Moscow contributed to this reportThree days after Donald Trump named his campaign foreign_policy team in March_2016 the youngest of the new advisers sent an email to seven campaign officials with the subject line Meeting with Russian Leadership - Including PutinThe adviser offered to set_up a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss US-Russia ties under President Trump telling them his Russian contacts welcomed the opportunityaccording to internal campaign emails read to The Washington PostThe proposal sent a ripple of concern through campaign headquarters in Trump_Tower Campaign co-chairman Sam_Clovis wrote that he thought NATO_allies should be consulted before any plans were made Another Trump adviser retired Navy Rear Adm Charles Kubic cited legal concerns including a possible violation of US sanctions against Russia and of the Logan Act which prohibits US citizens from unauthorized negotiation with foreign governmentsBut Papadopoulos a campaign volunteer with scant foreign_policy experience persisted Between March and September the self-described energy consultant sent at_least a half-dozen requests for Trump as he turned from primary candidate to party nominee or for members of his team to meet with Russian officials Among those to express concern about the effort was then-campaign chairman_Paul Manafort who rejected in May 2016 a proposal from Papadopoulos for Trump to do soThe exchanges are among more_than 20000 pages of documents the Trump campaign turned over to congressional_committees this month after review by White_House and defense lawyers The selection of Papadopouloss emails were read to The_Post by a person with access to them Two other people with access to the emails confirmed the general tone of the exchanges and some specific passages within them Papadopoulos emerges from the sample of emails as a new and puzzling figure in the examination of the Trump campaigns contacts with Russian officials and their proxies during the 2016 election now the subject of a special-counsel investigationLess than a decade out of college Papadopoulos appeared to hold little sway within the campaign and it is unclear_whether he was acting as an intermediary for the Russian_government although he told campaign officials he wasWhile the emails illustrate his eagerness to strengthen the campaigns connections to the Russian_government Papadopoulos does_not spell out in them why it would be in Trumps interest to do so His entreaties appear to have generated more concern than excitement within the campaign which at the time was looking to seal the Republican nomination and take on a heavily favored Hillary_Clinton in the general electionBut the internal resistance to Papadopouloss requests is at odds with other overtures Trump allies were making toward Russia at the time mostly at a more senior level of the campaignThree months after Papadopoulos raised the possibility of a meeting between Trump and Russian President_Vladimir Putin the presidents son Donald Trump Jr and son-in-law_Jared Kushner met with a delegation led by a Russian lawyer offering to provide damaging_information on Clinton attended that Trump_Tower session in June_2016 a meeting now under_scrutiny in the special_counsels collusion inquiry But the new emails reveal that Manafort had rejected a request from Papadopoulos just the previous month to set_up a meeting between Trump and Russian officialsIn July 2016 and again two months later Jeff_Sessions then a senator and senior foreign_policy adviser to Trump And also in July a few_weeks after Papadopoulos asked his superiors whether other campaign advisers or aides could accept some of the Russians invitations Carter_Page another foreign_policy adviser spoke at a Russian university in Moscow Page said he made the trip independently of the campaignTo experts in Russian intelligence gathering the Papadopoulos chain offers further evidence that Russians were looking for entry points and playing upon connections with lower-level aides to penetrate the 2016 campaignFormer CIA_director John Brennan in May told the House_Intelligence Committee that he had seen worrisome evidence of contacts and interactions between Russian officials and the Trump campaign although he offered no specificsSteven L Hall who retired from the CIA in 2015 after 30_years of managing the agencys Russia operations said when told by The_Post about the emails The bottom line is that theres no_doubt in my mind that the Russian_government was casting a wide net when they were looking at the American election I_think they were doing very basic intelligence work Whos out there Whos willing to play ball And how can we use themPapadopoulos a former intern and researcher at the conservative Hudson Institute was on a list of campaign volunteers that Trump announced as his foreign_policy advisory team during Trump called Papadopoulos an excellent guy Almost immediately Papadopoulos came under_scrutiny for his lack of experience He graduated from college in 2009 and his LinkedIn profile cited his participation in a Model UN program for students among his qualifications Papadopoulos did_not respond to repeated requests for comment Page who has been the subject of a foreign surveillance warrant over his connections to Russia said the Papadopoulos email_exchange was another sign that the Russia communications were inconsequentialThe entirely benign offer from a volunteer member of the Trump movement is infinitely less relevant than the real collusion in the 2016 election said Page who was copied on the first Papadopoulos email communication in March Page said in an email_exchange Saturday that the real scandal lies among Clinton and Obama associates who fed false evidence to investigators that he said formed the basis of the federal warrant concerning him Papadopoulos made more_than a half-dozen overtures on behalf of Russians or people with Russia contacts whom he claimed to knowOn March 24 Clovis the campaign co-chairman who also served on the foreign_policy team reacted to one proposed Russia meeting by writing We thought we probably should not go forward with any meeting with the Russians until we have had occasion to sit with our NATO alliesIn the same email chain Kubic the retired admiral reminded others about legal restrictions on meetings with certain Russian officials adding Just want to make_sure that no one on the team outruns their headlights and embarrasses the campaignUndeterred Papadopoulos alerted then-campaign manager_Corey Lewandowski in an April email that he was receiving a lot of calls over the past month about arranging a Russia meetingPutin wants to host the Trump team when the time is right he wrote on April 27 On May 4 Papadopoulos forwarded Lewandowski and others a note he received from the program head for the government-funded Russian International_Affairs Council In it Ivan Timofeev a senior official in the organization reached out to report that Russian foreign ministry officials were open to a Trump visit to Moscow and requested that the campaign and Russians write a formal letter outlining the meeting Clovis responded to the Timofeev invitation by noting There are legal issues we need to mitigate meeting with foreign officials as a private citizenThe email chain does_not show a response from Lewandowski who did_not return calls seeking commentSeveral weeks later Papadopoulos forwarded the same message from Timofeev to Manafort the newly named campaign chairmanRussia has been eager to meet with Mr Trump for some time and have been reaching_out to me to discuss the adviser told ManafortManafort reacted coolly forwarding the email to his associate Rick_Gates with a note We_need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these tripsGates agreed and told Manafort he would ask the campaigns correspondence coordinator to handle it the person responding to all mail of non-importance to signify this did_not need a senior official to respond A spokesman for Manafort whose Virginia home was raided by FBI_agents three weeks ago as part of an investigation by special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III said the email chain provides concrete evidence that the Russia collusion narrative is fake newsMr Manaforts swift action reflects the attitude of the campaign any invitation by Russia directly or indirectly would be rejected outright Manafort spokesman_Jason Maloni said in a statementIn an email to The_Post Timofeev confirmed that his organization had discussed a meeting with the Trump campaign in the spring of 2016The Russian International_Affairs Council was created in 2010 by a decree of then-President Dmitry Medvedev as a project of various Russian_government agencies It is led by former foreign_minister Igor Ivanov Its board includes Russias current foreign_minister Sergei Lavrov as well as top Russian scholars and business leaders among them the chairman of Alfa-Bank and Sberbank two of Russias largest banksWe discussed the idea informally as one of the opportunities for dialogue between Russia and the US Timofeev said in the email RIAC often hosts meetings with prominent political figures and experts from the US and many other countriesHe said the group would have been open to meeting with other campaignsClinton spokesman Nick Merrill said officials with the Democrats campaign have no recollections or record of having been contacted by the group Similarly an adviser to Barack_Obamas first presidential campaign former

nomination has been previously reported by The Washington_Post and several other outlets is a former economics professor at Morningside College in Sioux City Iowa who served as one of Trumps first campaign policy advisers In a with Iowa Public Radio he said he was extremely skeptical about climate_change and added that a lot of the science is junk scienceIts not proven I dont_think theres any substantive information available to me that doesnt raise as many questions as it does answers Clovis said in the interview So Im a skepticThis position represents a departure from the scientific consensus In its most recent report theUN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changethat it is extremely likely that since the 1950s humans and their greenhouse gas emissions have been the dominant cause of the planets warming trendNeither USDA nor Clovis responded to inquiries earlier_this week about the prospect of his appointment and his views on climate scienceClovis who started at USDA as a senior White_House adviser just after Trump was inaugurated possesses a BS in political science an MBA degree and a doctorate in public administration according to the White_House The post for which he is being nominated the Agriculture Departments undersecretary for research_education and economics has by a string of individuals with advanced degrees in science or medicineThe overall portfolio that would be managed by Clovis if he is confirmed by the Senate isworth about $ 3 billion with $ 2 billion devoted to research and $ 1 billion to education according to Catherine Woteki a nutrition

Obama_administration the Agriculture Department had elevated the issue of climate_change seeking to curb agricultural emissions as well as help farmers adapt to changing conditions by creating regional across the United_States Then-Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack sought to enlist farmers ranchers and forest owners in the effort to capture and store carbon nationwide Since Trump took_office the agency has shifted the description of some of these efforts On Wednesday for example the departmentsNational Institute of Food and Agriculture announced nine grants totaling more_than $8 million to study and develop new approaches for the agriculture sector to adapt to and mitigate the effects of changing environmental conditions But the same press release noted that four of them were directed toward climate outreach and extension and another five were focused on climate and land useClovis an Iowa political activist who ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate in 2014 has emphasized his military and foreign_policy experiencein the past During the 2016_presidential race and other mattersIn the2014 Iowa Public Radio Interview Clovis outlined his credentials for public serviceI think that if you look at my experience 25 years in the military and the various jobs and opportunities I had while_serving the nation my experience as a business man and my academic preparation my experience in a variety of other fields including homeland_security foreign_policy national_security policy creating jobs and all those things Clovis saidThe White_House announcement of his nomination emphasizes his military background noting After graduating from the [US Air Force] Academy Mr Clovis spent 25 years serving in the Air_Force He retired as the Inspector General of the North American Aerospace Defense Command and the United_States Space Command and was a command pilotThe position for which Clovis has been appointed ranks among themost critical science and technology roles in the federal government a 2008 report by the National Academy of Sciences The position requires Senate confirmationThe Trump administration has been slow to fill top Senate-confirmed science

ownership of his company while shifting assets into a trust managed by his sons a step that Trump and his advisers said will eliminate potential conflicts of interest between his public duties and private businessThe move announced Wednesday in Trumps first news_conference since July followed weeks of criticism from ethics_experts and congressional Democrats who have said his financial entanglements could improperly steer his presidential decision-makingThe announcement included a pledge from a Trump lawyer that the company would make no new foreign deals whatsoever during Trumps presidency and that any new domestic deals would undergo vigorous review including approval by an independent ethics adviserIn addition Trump is giving up his position as an officer at the company the Trump_Organization ceding all management responsibilities and agreeing to what his lawyers described as strict limits on communications with company executives beyond receiving regular profit-and-loss statementsSheri Dillon a tax adviser at global law_firm Morgan Lewis said Trump has sought to isolate himself from the business that will be managed by Trumps sons Donald Jr and Eric and company executive Allen WeisselbergTrump she said will only know of a deal if he sees it in the paper or on TV She added that Trump also terminated all pending international dealsBut Trumps continued financial stake in a global real_estate and branding company is likely to remain a point of contention between the president-elect and federal ethics officials who have said that full divestiture remains the only way to prevent conflictsDillon who also wrote a widely shared letter last_year that asserted Trumps tax_returns were under_audit argued that taking steps recommended by some vocal ethics_experts would trigger additional problems A sell-off would have created additional conflicts she said while a blind_trust would have been unrealistic for a real_estate company with high-profile assetsPresident Trump cant unknow he owns Trump_Tower Dillon said and he should not be expected to destroy the company he builtThe announcement inspired an unusual and highly critical response from the top federal official at the agency that works closely with presidential transition teams to ensure they abide by ethics requirementsWalter Shaub director of the Office of Government Ethics took the stage at a Wednesday event for the Brookings Institution think_tank to say that Trumps decision doesnt meet the standards that every president of the past four decades has metShaub appointed by President Obama in 2013 said the trust adds nothing to the equation because its not even close to a blind_trust and called other Trump provisions wholly inadequateShaub whose agency administers financial disclosure filings and advises executive_branch officials on avoiding conflicts of interest does_not have the power to force Trumps hand The director said he spoke out in hopes the president-elect would fully divestSome ethics_experts also expressed alarm Wednesday that the changes leave plenty of room for foreign interests and others to enrich the president and affect US policyRichard Painter who was ethics counsel in the George_W Bush White_House said the setup will not prevent Trump from knowing his business sources of revenue or block him from receiving income from the trust Trump_Tower projects still stand for instance in the Philippines Turkey Uruguay and other hot spots where foreign buyers or governments could still lavish money on the Trump brandHe still has businesses all over the world and we still do not know who is financing those businesses and who hes indebted to Painter saidReferring to the yet-unnamed expert who would be hired to sign off on new deals Painter added That ethics adviser is going to have a lot of work to do Sounds like hell need air supportTrump also retained his ownership share of the luxury hotel he opened last_year in the Old Post Office Pavilion down the street from the White_House despite criticism that foreign leaders might try to curry favor with the administration by doing business there and at his other hotels possibly violating the Constitutions emoluments clauseThe clause has never been tested in the courts but it is upheld by threat of impeachment and some scholars say Trump risks violating it the day hes sworn into office The Washington hotel of which Trump owns 76percent has been frequented by foreign diplomats since the election Trump himself has signed for hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate loans from foreign banks and is currently involved in deals with foreign investors across several continentsDillon Trumps attorney dismissed the suggestion of a problem saying the clause would not apply to arms-length transactions the president-elect has nothing to do with such as hotel stays for foreign diplomatsNevertheless Dillon said the hotel would donate all profits from foreign government payments from the Trump International Hotel to the US TreasuryIn his news_conference Wednesday at Trump_Tower in Manhattan Trump showcased his signature theatrics He stood by several stacks of what he said were legal papers related to the Trump_Organization changes He noted repeatedly that the president is not covered by any conflict-of-interest laws and that he was sure he could do a good job leading both the company and the country if he so choseI could actually run my business and run government at the same_time he said But he added later I dont_want to take_advantage of something I have something that others dont haveAnd if his sons do a bad job Trump added he will tell them his catchphrase from The Apprentice Youre firedTrump said his commitment to focus on the presidency has already cost him business adding he had in recent_days turned down $2billion to do a number of deals in Dubai with Hussain Sajwani the billionaire chairman of the Damac Properties development firm and a man Trump has called a friendA Damac executive said the company confirms that the discussions took_place as stated in the media briefing but the proposals were declined by the Trump_Organization and that the proposals were for a variety of different property dealsTrumps plan will also include tapping a chief compliance counsel at the Trump_Organization who will monitor the Trump businesses for any actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency Dillon saidNeither Trump nor Dillon said who would fill the position and requests to speak with company representatives were not immediately returnedThe Trump_Organization is a vast worldwide collection of golf courses hotels condo towers and other commercial holdings spread across more_than 500 business_interests financial filings showMuch of the companys revenue stems from deals with real_estate developers and merchandisers who pay the company millions of dollars to use Trumps name and imagePresidents are exempt from conflict-of-interest laws that force virtually all other executive-branch officials to sell off their business_interests as well as recuse themselves from public decision-making that could benefit their private finances The president must still abide by bribery fraud and corruption laws that could arise from potential financial conflictsModern presidents have followed a tradition of selling potentially problematic assets or sequestering them into a blind_trust overseen by an independent manager with unassailable controlThe trust_agreement outlined Wednesday will not be truly blind critics said due to Trumps family relationship to its leaders his sonsTrumps daughter_Ivanka will also step down from management of the Trump_Organization and her name-brand fashion jewelry and licensing companies lawyers said She will also restructure her involvement in potentially profitable Trump_Organization deals and instead receive fixed payments from the revenue of what lawyers called a diversified pool of unidentified projectsFixed-income agreements are common approaches to addressing conflicts for spouses of those stepping into government But like her father Ivanka Trump has not committed to selling off her ownership stake leaving one of her largest conflicts unresolvedIvanka Trumps husband Jared_Kushner who Trump will name as a White_House adviser will sell off much of his New_York real_estate and media fortune and resign from the family business to avoid conflicts his lawyers said this weekMany questions remain Trump has not released his income tax_returns which would give the most precise look yet at Trumps holdings business_interests and foreign accounts Trump has blamed several years of Internal_Revenue Service audits among other factors for his reluctance to release the returns Presidents by law are audited every year and not required to release their returns Trumps sons too have already run into the minefield of potential conflicts awaiting the presidents family Eric Trump said recently that he will leave his foundation following worries that donors could receive special access or favors from the Trump administrationCongressional Democrats on Monday introduced a law that would force Trump and future presidents to divest their business_interests and other potential conflicts But their Republican counterparts have largely stayed silent on Trumps entanglements or said they trust his judgment drawing the laws success into question Jonathan OConnell contributed to this reportClose observers of the 2016 election will remember that on occasion President Trump liked to draw attention to his opponents security practices as a way of criticism There was you may recall something about an email serverHillary Clinton sent classified_information even during her travels overseas jeopardizing the national_security of the American people by allowing her emails to be hacked by foreign intelligence services Trumps campaign declared But it wasnt just Clinton who was the target of his criticism The Democratic_National Committee got hacked because it didnt have a very strong defense_system against hacking the way the Republicans did (as he said during a cybersecurity session on Jan 31) The government was hacked by China because were run by people that dont_know what theyre doing (as said in his Jan 11 news conference) Trump the idea went would not be so naive on the critical subject of national securityPerhaps its harder than it looksSunday night CNN details of the moment that Trump joined by Japanese_Prime Minister_Shinzo Abe learned about a missile_launch in North_Korea Trump and Abe were enjoying dinner at Trumps exclusive Mar-a-Lago_Club in Florida at the time but CNN reported began to discuss the details of this international incident right there at their table As Mar-a-Lagos wealthy members looked on from their tables and with a keyboard player crooning in the background CNNs Kevin Liptak reported Trump and Abes evening meal quickly morphed into a strategy session the decision-making on full view to fellow diners who described it in detail to CNNEarlier in the week Trump had been criticized for leaving intelligence documents vulnerable to people without security clearance Sen Martin Heinrich (D-NM) noticed that the president kept the key in a secured bag while hosting people in the Oval_Office which is a bit like leaving your house keys in your front door while youre having a party in your backyard Theres_no indication that anyone saw anything confidential in this incident but this Heinrich suggested was Classified 101Never leave a key in a classified lockbag in the presence of non-cleared people (Original Photo ) Martin Heinrich (@MartinHeinrich) Compared to holding a national_security conversation over dinner in the public dining room at his private club though the lockbag incident palesIts not clear that anyone heard particulars of the conversation but other diners certainly noticed Richard DeAgazio was in the room and posted photos of the moment to FacebookOthers who were there added their thoughts in the comments beneath the post One wrote that he was watching very close by Had no idea what it was about Thats probably not the case for the waiters who CNN reports cleared the wedge salads and brought along the main course as Trump and Abe continued consulting with aidesNotice though that the photos appear to corroborate an important detail from the CNN report The patio was lit only with candles and moonlight so aides used the camera lights on their phones to help the stone-faced Trump and Abe read through the documents Liptak writes In DeAgazios first photo you can see a phone flashlight being used in that wayWhy is this important Mobile phones have flashlights yes and cameras microphones and Internet connectivity When Edward Snowden was meeting with reporters in Hong_Kong at the moment he was leaking the material hed stolen from the NSA he famously asked that they blocking any radio signals in the event that the visitors phones had been hacked This was considered the most secure way of ensuring that the phones couldnt be used as wiretaps even more secure than removing the battery Phones especially phones with their flashes turned on for improved visibility are portable television satellite trucks and if compromised can be used to get a great deal of information about whats_happening nearby unless precautions are taken Precautions werent taken One of DeAgazios photos shows Trump using a phone at the table within view of other diners (and while sitting next to a foreign leader) Its not clear what phone Trump is using in that picture but its known that he uses a relatively old Android device even while_serving as president As we Trump generally uses that device when hes not in the middle of a work day Shortly before the dinner with Abe he tweeted from itA working dinner tonight with Prime_Minister Abe of Japan and his representatives at the Winter White_House (Mar-a-Lago) Very good talks Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) The problem is that Trumps Android phone would be very simple to hack to provide precisely the sort of access described above NPR the question of how secure that phone might be and Berkeley computer scientist Nicholas Weaver was bluntDonald Trump for the longest time has been using a insecure Android phone that by all reports is so easy to compromise it would not meet the security requirements of a teenager Weaver told NPR and while he couldnt say for sure we must assume that his phone has actively been compromised for a while and an actively compromised phone is literally a listening deviceThats just one of the phones that may have been at the table for the conversationThe picture thats painted is one that runs contrary to the arguments Trump made on the campaign_trail While running for the presidency cybersecurity and the risk of compromise were cardinal sins necessitating that he be given the most_powerful position in America Now that hes attained that position though his attitude toward security seems a bit more laxSpicer also said with Mar A Lago this weekend President was briefed in a SCIF and dinner discussion was just logistics over a presser Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs)Debate intensified in President Trumps political circle Tuesday over how aggressively to confront special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III dividing some of the presidents advisers and loyalists as the Russia investigation enters a new phase following charges_against three former Trump campaign officialsDespite his with a he has roundly dismissed Trump has been cooperating with Mueller and lately has resisted attacking him directly at the inside and outside the White HouseBut several prominent Trump allies including former White_House chief_strategist Stephen_K Bannon have said they think the presidents posture is too timid Seeing the investigation as a political threat they are clamoring for a more combative approach to Mueller that would damage his credibility and effectively kneecap his operation by cutting its fundingStill Bannon and others are not advising Trump to fire Mueller a rash move that the presidents lawyers and political advisers oppose and insist is not under considerationBannon in recent_days has spoken with Trump by phone to relay his concerns about the presidents position and to counsel a shift in strategy according to three people with knowledge of the conversation The president so_far has not accepted Bannons advice these people saidBannons view has been amplified elsewhere on the right with talk_radio and cable news commentators speaking out more forcefully against Mueller and his expanding probe The Wall_Street Journal has called on Mueller to resign The Journal is part of News Corp which is led by Rupert Murdoch a friend of Trump who speaks privately with the presidentBut many people in Trumps orbit recommend that he stay the course with cooperation encouraging him to harshly criticize media coverage of the investigation but avoid engaging MuellerI like Steve but his advice is not always the most helpful said Christopher Ruddy a Trump friend and the chief_executive of Newsmax a conservative media outlet In this case whatever Steve says the president should do the opposite The where Republican lawmakers have mostly split into two camps those who are wary of weighing in on Muellers investigation and those who see it as a prime political targetBannon is demanding that GOP leaders move swiftly to end congressional probes into Russian_interference undermine Muellers investigation and increase scrutiny on Democratic controversiesThe Republicans are like church mice Bannon said Tuesday No support of the president Totally gutless The Hill needs to step upSenate Judiciary_Committee Chairman Charles_E Grassley (R-Iowa) said he believes that Republicans should proceed carefully and he called Mueller a very ethical personI dont_know how you could improve things by interfering Grassley said The process just ought to goHouse Intelligence_Committee Chairman Devin_Nunes (R-Calif) a trusted Trump ally has launched an investigation_into and is preparing to invite witnesses this week to testify about the FBIs handling of Russia investigations Nunes intends to issue subpoenas if people decline to appear according to people briefed on his plansFormer House speaker Newt_Gingrich an informal Trump adviser who praised Mueller earlier_this year after his appointment as special_counsel said he has slowly soured on the former FBI_director and agrees that Congress should put a harsher national spotlight on himMueller ought to be held accountable Gingrich saidHe ticked through a series of what he considers questionable moves by Mueller and his team including their handling of former Trump foreign_policy adviser whom the government described in an indictment unsealed_Monday as a proactive cooperatorCongress should look seriously at whether Mueller put a wire on this guy and sent him around to entrap people Gingrich said If that happened Congress better see the full transcripts not just the FBIs edited versions Congress should also ask why theyre [former campaign_chairman Paul] Manaforts home at 5 am for a white-collar crime from a few years agoThis sentiment is not heard at the White_House however where officials have been careful not to antagonize the special counselOur approach has been to be cooperative and responsive and to see this come to a quick conclusion White_House press_secretary Sarah_Huckabee Sanders said Have we been aggressive in our comments and our feelings towards the Clinton campaign and the DNC Yes But thats where our aggression is seen and nowhere elseTy Cobb the White_House lawyer overseeing Russia matters said after Mondays indictments of Manafort and his longtime deputy_Rick Gates Nothing about todays events alters anything related to our engagement with the special_counsel with whom we continue to cooperateCobb added There are no discussions and there is no consideration being given to terminating MuellerRepublicans in Congress said Trump is wise to avoid messing with MuellerThere would be an uprising at the Capitol like never seen before if any kind of interference looked like it was taking place said Sen Bob Corker (R-Tenn) Regardless of which side of the aisle Thats just beyond the pale Among Republicans there is broad agreement to bring attention to past controversies involving Hillary_Clinton Trumps Democratic_opponent in the 2016 election that have animated hourly discussions on Fox_News Channel and conservative talk_radio programsThe White_House and allies have waged a public relations battle over the Clinton campaigns and the Democratic_National Committees that resulted in the famous dossier that details Trumps alleged connections to RussiaThe dossier has become a lightning rod with congressional Republican leaders trying to discredit Fusion_GPS the firm that commissioned the dossier and the documents author Christopher_Steele a former_British intelligence_officer with ties to the US intelligence communityRepublicans also are trying to bring scrutiny to while Clinton was secretary of state The deal which Trump used as a political cudgel against Clinton during the campaign allowed a Russian nuclear energy agency to acquire a controlling stake in a Canadian-based company that had mining licenses for about 20_percent of US uranium_extraction capacity although the company cannot export uraniumFox News Channel host Sean Hannity a Trump confidant decried the lack of investigative attention on Clinton a point the president and his top aides have made in recent daysThis is not hyperbole Hannity said Monday_night in his which the president is known to watch regularly I am not overstating the case We are at a major crisis point in America tonight Do we have equal justice under the law in this country todaySome Republican lawmakers have heeded these calls House and Senate GOP leaders have announced two investigations into the uranium_deal while at_least three congressional_committees are continuing to look into how the FBI handled Clintons email scandalBut there appears to be little appetite for legislation that would cut Muellers funding or otherwise limit the scope of his investigation something various Trump allies have suggested is necessaryMy basic philosophy is once you have an independent counsel you ought to give him a chance to follow the facts said Sen_Richard C Shelby (R-Ala) a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the chairman of the subcommittee that handles the Justice_Departments funding If somebodys doing a job you dont_want to cut it offSen Susan Collins (R-Maine) said The idea that Bob Mueller is going to have the scope of his inquiry constrained or be otherwise restricted is really out there I_think thats extremely unlikely Karoun Demirjian and Sean Sullivan contributed to this reportPresident Trump on Thursday aired his grievances against the news media the intelligence_community and his detractors generally in a sprawling stream-of-consciousness news_conference that alternated between claims that he had inherited a mess and the assertion that his fledgling administration is running like a fine-tuned machineTo be honest I inherited a mess Trump said in a news_conference that lasted more thanan hour and was at times rambling combative and pointed Its a mess At home and abroad a mess Jobs are pouring out of the countryYet moments later the president seemed to acknowledge the widespread reports of turbulence and upheaval emanating out of his West_Wing only to claim that his White_House which so_far has been marred by staff infighting a controversial travel_ban false_statements and myriad leaks was operating seamlesslyI turn on the TV open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos chaos he said Yet it is the exact opposite This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine despite the fact that I cant get my Cabinet approvedAsked about recent reports that Mike Flynn his former national_security adviser who resigned Monday evening had improperly discussed Russian sanctions with the Russian_ambassador to the United_States before Trump was sworn in the president defended Flynn as a fine person saying he had done nothing wrong in engaging the Russian envoyBut Trump said Flynn had erred by misleading government officials including Vice_President Pence about his conversations which is why the president ultimately demanded his resignationHe didnt tell the vice_president of the United_States the facts Trump said And then he didnt remember And that just wasnt acceptable to meTrump made clear he had no problem with Flynn discussing the sanctions_imposed on Moscow by the Obama_administration with the Russian_ambassador even if he was not directly toldto do so by Trump saying it was Flynnsjob to reach out to foreign officialsNo I didnt direct him but I would have directed him if he didnt do it he saidTrump was asked several_times about whether his campaign had contact with Russia and grew testy as reporters pushed him for a yes-or-no answerHe said he certainly hadnt and that he was not aware of such contacts during the campaignI can tell_you speaking for myself I own nothing in Russia Trump said I have no loans in Russia I dont have any deals in Russia President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election He then called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration which was terrific But so did many other leaders almost all other leaders from almost all of the countries So thats the extentTrump also used the questions to press his case that the United_States would be well-served by a better relationship with Russia and to mock his Democratic_opponent Hillary_Clinton for her efforts to reset the relationship between the two countries while she was secretary of stateTrump derisively referred to that stupid plastic button that made us all look like jerks a reference to the red reset button that Clinton presented to the Russian foreign_minister early in the Obama administrationThe news_conference was ostensibly billed as a chance for Trump to announce his new pick to head the Labor Department Alexander Acosta who would be the first Latino in Trumps Cabinet after Andrew Puzder his original choice withdrew from consideration Wednesday amid mounting opposition on Capitol_Hill But for onehour and 17 minutes the president offered the verbal equivalent of the brash and impetuous early morning tweets that have become the alarm clock for much of Washington taking aim at everything from illegal immigrant violence to the criminal leaks within his intelligence communityTrump said he would use his remarks to bypass the dishonest media and speak directly to the American people about the incredible progress his administration has madeThe media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges we made and theyre not happy about it for whatever reason he saidThough the president began on a subdued almost melancholy note looking down repeatedly to read from prepared remarks on his lectern he became more fiery and animated joyful even when he began to banter and joust with the assembled reporters At times he seemed to reprise some of his favorite themes from the campaign_trail complaining about Clinton and criticizing President_Barack Obamas policies from his Affordable_Care Act to his failed reset with RussiaTrump repeatedly lambasted the fake_news media which at one point he upgraded (or downgraded) to the very fake_news media while promoting some dubious claims and fake_news of his ownPressed on his incorrect assertion that he had the largest margin of victory in the electoral college since President Ronald_Reagan Trump blamed faulty factsI was given that information he said Well I dont_know I was given that informationOn a substantive note Trump said his administration would submit a replacement plan for the Affordable_Care Act in early to mid-March and should have a tax reform package around the same timeTax reform is going to happen fairly quickly Trump said Were doing Obamacare Were in final stagesDuring the news_conference Trump alternated between showering the media with scorn and taking a more playful toneAt one point he insisted he was enjoying himself Im not ranting and raving I love this he said Im having a good time doing thisTrumps Thursday performance seemed an acknowledgment by the president that he may be his own best press_secretary and adviser and allowed him to appear both confident and comfortable While many of his comments as well as the sometimes disjointed nature of his delivery are certain to alarm official Washington they are also the sorts of red-meat talking_points that delighted his base during the campaign and helped propel him to victoryI won with news_conferences and probably speeches he told the assembled reporters I certainly didnt win by people listening to you peoplePresident Trumpsought Monday to distance himself from the federal money-laundering charges againsttwo of his top campaign aidesPaul Manafort and Rick_Gates by saying their alleged conspiracy occurred years_ago and asserting that there is NO COLLUSIONThe first White_House comment aboutMondays 12-count_indictment came in a pair of tweets from the president who continued his days-long drum beatto ratchet up pressure on his former foe Hillary_Clinton and the DemocratsTrump tweeted Sorry but this is years_ago before Paul_Manafort was part of the Trump campaign But why arent Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focusIn a second tweet sent three minutes later Trump wrote Also there is NO

with a foreign professor connected to Russian officialsManafort who served as Trumps campaign_chairman for several months in mid-2016 and Gates who was Manaforts top deputy on the campaign were

Russias influence in the 2016 election and possible_coordination with the Trump campaign The chargesagainst Manafort and Gates focused on their years of lucrative work advising foreign_governments and political parties including a party in Ukraine closely aligned with Russian President_Vladimir PutinOver the weekend as Washington braced for the first batch of indictments from Muellers investigation Trump sought to shift attention from his campaign and associates to his former opponent Clinton In Twitter outbursts amplified by Trump allies the president said the Mueller probe was unfair and demanded that investigations be launched into various Clinton controversies There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton and now the facts are pouring out DO SOMETHING Trump wrote in one tweetLater in the morning Trump added All of this Russia talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts & Reform Is this coincidental NOTDonald Trumps adult sons who are overseeing a nationwide expansion of the family business during their fathers presidency are envisioning ways that their experiences from the campaign_trail can help them establish a footing in dozens of new marketsThe idea is to move beyond a focus on luxury hotels in big metropolises and build boutique properties in a broader mix of cities including some the Trump brothers came to know well during more_than a year of intensive travel fundraising and grass-roots networking on the road to the White HouseI got to see a lot of those markets on the campaign Donald Trump Jr the presidents eldest son told The Washington_Post in a recent interview from his office on the 25th floor of Trump_Tower I_think Ive probably been in all of them over the last 18 monthsThe initial plan is tied to the Trumps previously announced new chain Scion which is being designed as a less-corporate feeling brand of high-end hotels with a more affordable per-room price point than the Trumps five-star properties As with many existing Trump-branded property deals the developers would own the hotels while the Trumps would be paid licensing and management feesThe company says it has signed at_least 17 letters of intent with potential developers It is targeting an array of cities such as Austin Dallas St Louis Nashville and Seattle and Trump Jr said the campaign proved useful in forging relationships with potential new connectionsI met people along the way that would be awesome partners he saidThe expansion plan illustrates how President Trumps political rise has the potential to affect his business even as he and his sons promise to adhere to a strict ethical boundary between the companys moves and the Trump administration And it shows the inherent challenge in separating the familys political work from its corporate interests with upsides and potential problemsExtending the Trump business into a greater cluster of American cities could bring political benefits for a president who has vowed to bring jobs and economic prosperity to struggling communities But it also comes as Trump has faced criticism from Democrats and ethics officials for his decision to retain his ownership stake in the company a decision that means he stands to personally benefit from its growthBuilding new hotels for example could create issues tax disputes allegations of labor violations or environmental violations that require federal departments to consider cases that could directly impact the presidents finances And while the Trumps have vowed to sign no new foreign deals pursuing a raft of new domestic contracts from coast to coast means the Trumps are likely to engage in negotiations with private developers banks and investors who see additional benefits in doing business with the presidents companyIts just going to add fuel to the fire that is already burning with him having still a foot in both the boardroom and one in the Oval_Office said Scott Amey the general counsel of the nonpartisan watchdog group Project on Government OversightThe White_House did_not respond to a request for comment The president in January added a team of ethics lawyers to the White_House Counsels Office while the company hired a longtime Republican attorney tasked with ensuring the Trump_Organization minimizes conflicts of interestIn interviews the Trump sons waved off the idea that their plans created any potential ethical problemsThere are lines that we would never cross and thats mixing business with anything government Eric Trump saidDonald Trump Jr said that since the inauguration he has spoken with his father twice on the phone and once in person when he and his brother attended the announcement of their fathers Supreme_Court nominee Neil Gorsuch Eric Trump said he may ask his father how things are in the White_House but would never discuss government or business affairsWill we ever talk about tax policy Will I ever ask for anything that could otherwise benefit the business Absolutely emphatically not Eric Trump said He has no need to know what were doing and I certainly dont need to know what theyre doing and I dont_want toThe Trumps point man on the expansion is Eric Danziger an experienced executive who was hired in 2015 after previously overseeing expansions at Carlson Hotels Worldwide Starwood Hotels and the former Wyndham InternationalOne of the first Scion projects is slated to open in Dallas where a Turkish-born developer aims to open a sleek glass six-story hotel as part of a $50million mixed-use downtown development The Austin Cincinnati Denver Detroit Nashville Seattle and St Louis areas are also possible targets according to reports by Bloomberg News and business trade publicationsThe Trumps declined to say what other cities they were exploring for projects but said they were actively seeking contracts in many placesDanziger speaking last_month to Skift an industry publication called Scion a four-star lifestyle brand with wide geographic appealThat kind of brand can be in every city tertiary secondary he said So how many is that The opportunity is for hundredsBecause of the prohibition on foreign deals Danziger said the company is going to have full focus instead of some focus on growth domestically of both Trump and Scion The expansion will not be easy according to analysts The Trumps will be entering a crowded marketplace of new hotel lines from Marriott Hilton and Hyatt designed to appeal to a broad cross-section of customers said Michael J Bellisario a senior research analyst with the firm Robert W Baird & CoThere are so many more competitors out there today Bellisario saidFor the Trumps to distinguish their projects from their competitors they will need to be choosy about locations Bellisario said Youve got to be on the right street corner in the right market You cant open these hotels in Topeka Kansas he said So when you think about that how big can the new line getThe plan is a big test for the younger TrumpsJust as Donald Trump stepped out from his fathers shadow in the 1970s to build the family real_estate business into todays worldwide collection of golf courses hotels condo towers branded merchandise and other commercial holdings now Donald Trump Jr 39 and Eric Trump 33 have a chance to make their mark Along with their sister Ivanka who departed the company when their father entered office the brothers have long served as executive vice presidentsBefore their father ran for president the three siblings helped expand the firm from focusing on New_York to including the management of luxury hotels in top US cities and seven countries plus more_than a dozen golf coursesThe fruits of that work are still coming as last_month the company opened a new golf club in Dubai and last_week held a grand opening for a new hotel-condominium tower in Vancouver BCA major transition for the sons is taking over a company in which the force behind every Trump company offering whether it was selling hotel rooms office buildings golf outings ties or raw steaks was Donald Trump himselfIn interviews Trump Jr and Eric Trump said they consider themselves protectors of the Trump brand an effort they said is sometimes misunderstood Critics viewed the announcement of Scion during the campaign as a move away from the Trump name The familys intent was the opposite since they view the name Trump has a standard for luxury that ought to be insulated they will use other brands for less pricey productsWe would never want to dilute the real_estate brand by going into tertiary markets that cant sustain the [luxury] properties as we build them Eric Trump said A lot of hotel companies have gotten this wrongBoth sons worked for their father starting at young ages doing landscaping and other labor on his projectsA University of Pennsylvania graduate Trump Jrs first assignment at the company was to work with executives at New_York City real_estate projectsEric Trump joined after graduating from Georgetown in 2006 He has overseen the Trump Winery near Charlottesville and worked on the Trump hotel in Las_Vegas where he developed a reputation as a hands-on executiveIf theres a property tax issue or any litigation he flies into Las_Vegas and takes care of it said Phil Ruffin a casino mogul who is the Trumps partner in the Las_Vegas project He hires the lawyer If there are any capital improvements he approves them He is very energetic like his father he will just work night and dayWith their father in charge there was an informal division of labor among his three eldest children governing which projects each swooped in to helpIvanka Trump created her own brands of shoes jewelry handbags and coats She took the lead on some of the Trump Organizations most prominent recent projects such as the $212million DC hotel which had its soft opening in SeptemberIm probably the most obviously like [Trump Sr] Ivanka Trump said in a 2011 company video titled Trump The Next GenerationIn certain ways she added Eric is very similar to him in terms of his love of construction and building And Don has his sense of humorThe Trumps planned corporate expansion comes as the president has faced intense criticism from Democrats and ethics_experts for his continued ownership interestA liberal watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) has sued Trump arguing that his hotel operations violate a constitutional provision barring the president from accepting gifts or payments from a foreign government Some Democrats have argued that Trumps international trademarks including one long-sought registration granted in February by China also violate the Constitutions emoluments clauseTrump has called the CREW lawsuit totally without meritAmey of the Project on Government Oversight said there were ways for the Trumps to avoid potential domestic conflicts related to the hotel expansion He said they could put the hotel business under another corporate structure which does_not involve a trust directly owned by the president himselfThere are solutions to solving this [but] there doesnt_seem to be a will and a desire to do that within the White_House Amey saidThe Trump brothers say they are taking ethics concerns seriously and are doing everything necessary to avoid distracting from their fathers work as presidentHave I used him as a sounding board in the past Onehundred percent Trump Jr said Have I learned a lot from him Couldnt have had a better mentor But hes got real stuff hes got to deal with These are real peoples lives So this notion that he is still running the business from the White_House is just insaneTrump Jr scoffed at the idea that his father might have somehow viewed running for president spending millions of dollars of his own money to run against more_than a dozen Republican challengers and Democratic_nominee Hillary_Clinton when few pundits gave him a chance to win as a moneymaking endeavorThats not a get-rich-quick scheme he said That doesnt make any sense whatsoeverPresident Trump suggested Thursday that the FBI may have had a hand in creating an intelligence dossier that alleged ties_between Russia and Trumps presidential campaignWorkers of firm involved with the discredited and Fake Dossier take the 5th Who paid for it Russia the FBI or the Dems (or all) Trump wrote on TwitterThe compendium of information about Trump much of it unproven was produced by a former_British intelligence agent last_year mostly before Trump won the 2016 election Officials have said the FBI has confirmed some of the information and rejected other parts and caution that it may be impossible to verify or disprove the rest Trump has vigorously denied allegations in the document that the Russian_government has collected compromising_information about him and was engaged in an active effort to assist his campaignThe Washington_Post has previously reported that the FBI agreed in October 2016 to pay the dossiers author Christopher_Steele for further work that might help its own investigation_into Russian election activitiesThe FBI as well as the Senate_Intelligence Committee is investigating Russian_interference in the election and alleged contacts_between Trumps associates and the KremlinAs the allegations contained in the dossier began appearing in news stories and the dossier itself became the subject of intense public debate Steele became a publicly known figure and the FBI did_not pursue further work from him The_Post reported in February Trumps Twitter question about whether the FBI may have paid for the document suggests that he is asking whether the bureau had been involved earlier in the process although his precise meaning is unclearAn FBI spokesman declined to commentRepublicans particularly Senate_Judiciary Chairman Charles_E Grassley (Iowa) have sought further answers from the FBI about its relationship with Steele and its plan to pay him for information that could incriminate Trump or his associatesIt is not uncommon for the FBI to pay sources of information and Steele was well known to the FBI Previously Steele had helped the FBI put together a sprawling global bribery case involving FIFA the governing body of world soccerWhen Steele started compiling the dossier in 2016 he was doing so for a Washington firm called Fusion_GPS The firm began researching Trump first for an unidentified GOP_donor and then later for DemocratsRepublican lawmakers have been pressing Fusion_GPS for months to identify those who paid for Steeles work but the firm has refused Fusion_GPS says that it has promised confidentiality to its clients and that violating that obligation would harm its business modelOn Wednesday a lawyer for Fusion_GPS said the firms employees refused to testify in response to a subpoena from the House_Intelligence Committee invoking their constitutional privilege not to do so The firms founder Glenn Simpson had previously given a 10-hour interview to the Senate_Judiciary CommitteeThe dossier alleged among other things that associates of Trump colluded with the Kremlin on cyberattacks on DemocratsTrump said Monday that there was no collusion with Russia and that special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_IIIs investigation_into Russian election activities should conclude quickly Muellers probe however is broader than just the collusion inquestSteele began his Trump investigation in June_2016 after working for another client preparing a report on Russian efforts to interfere with politics in EuropeUS intelligence had been independently tracking Russian efforts to influence electoral outcomes in EuropeRussian regime has been cultivating supporting and assisting TRUMP for at_least 5 years Steele wrote that JuneSteeles information was provided by an intermediary to the FBI and US intelligence officials after the Democratic_National Convention in July 2016 when hacked Democratic emails were first released by WikiLeaks according to a source familiar_with the events After the convention Steele contacted a friend in the FBI to personally explain what he had foundBefore Donald Trump proposed a 1000-mile wall on the US-Mexico border to stop migrants he tried to build a two-mile barrier on a pristine stretch of Irish coast to rein in an oceanHe didnt succeedIrish surfers weekend beachcombers environmental scientists local planners and even a microscopic snail got in his way In December Trump International Golf Links backed down from plans it had said were essential to protect the companys lone Irish course picturesquely nestled in dunes overlooking the Atlantic from being swallowed by rising seasFor a man who loves to win the defeat just a month after his election as president has left a bitter taste And despite the motley nature of the resistance Trump seems to have singled out a lone culprit the European_Union whose rules and regulations underpinned many of the objectionsIn interviews and public statements Trump has cited his tangle over the golf-course wall as Exhibit A in justifying a jaundiced view of the EU that puts him at odds with decades of bipartisan US foreign policyPrevious presidents Democrats and Republicans alike have seen the EU as an essential partner in global stability and a bulwark against the self-interested nationalism that spawned two world wars To Trump the blocs environmental protection regulations were a threat to his exquisitely manicured fairways and putting greensI found it to be a very unpleasant experience he told British and German interviewers last_month after bringing up the wall dispute unbidden when asked his opinion of the EUA bad experience he emphasized weeks later as he raised the issue at his first White_House news conferenceThe bureaucratic battle over a golf-course sea wall makes for an unlikely inflection point in geopolitical history And yet in Europe Trumps hostility toward the union that backers credit with keeping decades of continental peace is seen as a potentially fatal blowEuropean Council President Donald Tusk recently took the extraordinary step of including Trump on alist of threats to the already teetering EU right alongside China Russia and radical Islam The golf-course dispute of course is not the only explanation for Trumps disdain He has also criticized the EUs status as a trading rival to the United_States the predominance within the bloc of German interests and its suppression of national identitiesBut that a relatively minor spat at a golf course has any bearing on such a major foreign_policy stance is baffling to some of those who battled the wall especially they say because Trump has his facts wrongHe speaks as though it was the EU that stopped it It wasnt said Dave Flynn co-chair of a local surfers group that opposed the sea barrier Its amazing that such a big foreign_policy decision like this could be made on such an ill-informed basisThe 18-hole golf resort in the west Irish village of Doonbeg is a relatively small and recent addition to Trumps global business_empire which he signed over to his sons just before entering the White HouseIronically the resort was originally built with the help of a $4million grant from the EU The money was intended to spur rural development And for a time it did drawing international tourists and more_than 200 jobs to a village where cattle farming fishing and a handful of pubs had been the mainstays of the local economyBut by early 2014 just over a decade after opening the resort was struggling battered by the one-two punch of an Irish economy still reeling from the global downturn and severe winter storms that left the course badly damagedTrumps company swooped in and bought it at a deep discount reportedly for about $15millionThat spring Trump paid his new asset a visit At nearby Shannon Airport he was given a red-carpet welcome complete with a harpist and a handshake from the Irish finance minister In a radio interview he said he would invest about $45million in a dramatic upgrade and expansion of the resorts facilitiesBut as storms continued to pound away at the greens it became apparent that any investment would come to naught unless the fragile and ever-shifting dunes upon which the course is built were better defendedInitially the companys solution was to begin dumping piles of rock along the beach But the work lacked the necessary permits from County Clare and was haltedUltimately Trump International put an audacious plan before the county council a two-mile 200000-ton 15-foot-high rock wall that would sharply divide the dunes from the adjacent Doughmore BeachIt was a quantum leap from anything we had seen Flynn said It was big and brash just hugely shockingFlynn who works as a development manager said that he has been surfing at Doughmore for more_than 20 years The wide sandy half-moon beach is regarded as the best surf spot in western Ireland he said During the spring summer and autumn its perfect It just tracks in wavesHe and fellow club members quickly concluded that Trumps wall would destroy their meccaNature doesnt like hard lines he said The beach will erode at the front and the dunes will die at the back They need to work togetherResidents of Doonbeg a tiny verdant and windswept village on the Atlantic coast took a different view Trump International said it needed the wall to keep the resort open With course visitors pumping money into the economy locals rallied around Trump Internationals plan The scenery is beautiful here but you cant eat it You need to build in order to survive and thrive said Rita McInerney who owns a local cafe and general store and whose family has been in Doonbeg for seven generations Some people think were selling our souls by dealing with Trump International But prospects are few and far between in an area like this And the fact is its 200 jobs plus the spinoff for local businessesCoincidentally Vice_President Pence has ancestors who hail from Doonbeg which has also helped to consolidate local supportTrump has kept the jobs here and kept the tourists coming in He made a promise to the people of Doonbeg and he made good on it said Hugh McNally a local restaurant owner and Pences third cousinMcNally said that much of the opposition to the wall was generated based on political opposition to Trump and that it came from outside the villageOpponents acknowledge their outsider status but insist the objections they lodged with county planners are based on genuine concern for an important natural habitat Some of the legal objections though not all were based on the sites EU designation as a special area of conservation and a habitat for the narrow-mouthed whorl snail a rare and protected speciesIf you damage the dunes then you eventually eliminate the snails habitat said Tony Lowes director of Friends of the Irish Environment They will go if a wall is put in placeTrump has fumed at such arguments calling them environmental tricks to stop a project from being built in an_interview with the and Germanys BildHe also said his company had received the approvals very quickly from Ireland and then Ireland and my people went to the EU to get the approval It was going to take yearsThe reality however is that EU approval was never needed and Irish approval was never given The project was stalled at the county level with planners weighing objections based on local national and EU law A petition at the national level was rejectedTrump encouraged Britain to leave the EU and has said he believes other members will follow After the Brexit vote last June he in a ribbon-cutting at one of his Scottish golf courses Turnberry saying the vote was a positive because it would depress the value of Britains currencyWhen the pound goes down he said more people are coming to TurnberryThats proved correct The course has seen an upturn in businessSo has Doonbeg with the course benefiting from what its general manager Joe Russell said is an investment of over $25million in upgrades since Trump International bought itBut the resort will not be getting the rock wall at_least not as originally planned Just weeks after Trumps victory in November the company withdrew its proposal rather_than answer 51 questions posed by county planners Russell said the decision was made because approval would have taken years that the company does_not haveInstead Trump International has proposed two smaller walls which together are less_than a third the size of the original We hope [the new plan] will proceed through the planning process quicker Russell saidBut the battle continues Many of the same groups that opposed the original wall have objected to the new plan arguing that when the smaller barriers inevitably fail Trump International will be back demanding bigger onesSea walls Lowes said beget sea walls Karla_Adam

test by North_Korea While waiters came and went and while one club member snapped photos the two leaders reviewed documents by the light of an aides cellphoneThat strange scene in which Trump turned his table into an alfresco situation room astounded White_House veterans who were used to presidents retiring to private secured settings to hash out such an eventTrump became president in part because of Democrat Hillary_Clintons neglect of information security During the 2016 campaign Trump repeatedly called for Clinton to be jailed and his crowds at rallies often chanted Lock_her up for her use of a private email_server to handle government business while she was secretary of state Now Trump is drawing fire from Democrats for his own seemingly loose attitude toward information security He has continued to use an insecure cellphone according to the New_York Times He may have left a key to classified_information on his desk while visitors were in the Oval_Office according to a tweet from a Democratic senator And now Trump has used his bustling club in Palm_Beach Fla as a winter White_House except that unlike the actual White_House the club is full of other people

President-elect Donald Trump that inmates inBristol County Mass will help him build his contentiouswall along the US-Mexico borderBristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said at his inauguration ceremony Wednesday that he plans to put inmatevolunteers from the Bristol County House of Correction to work along the southern border Its part of Hodgsons proposal for a nationwide network of inmate workers who could help with things like natural disastercleanup and large infrastructureprojectsI can think of no other project that would have such a positive impact on our inmates and our_country than building this wall theRepublican sheriff said at Bristol Community College during his swearing-in ceremony for his fourth six-year term in office Aside from learning and perfecting construction skills the symbolism of these inmates building a wall to prevent crime in communities around the country and to preserve jobs and work opportunities for them and other Americans upon release can be very powerful he said During the presidential campaign building a massive wall along the 2000-mile border atMexicos expense an effort to keep outundocumentedimmigrants terrorists and illegal drugsThe idea became a focal point at Trumps campaign rallies with supporters chanting Trump has remained resolute in his planHodgson a reported longtime opponent of illegal immigrationsaid Trumps wall must be builtWe wont have legitimate immigration reform in this country until we build a wall Hodgson said Wednesday according to the Herald NewsAmid debate over who would foot the bill for the wallHodgson announced Project NICE (National Inmates Community Endeavors)a program aimed_at rehabilitating inmates by giving them work skills while also providing free labor for bigjobs He said inmates would respond to needs across the country including cleanup and repairs after catastrophicevents such as earthquakes hurricanes andtornadoes They would also work on major projects such as Trumps border wallThink of how_much good could come of 500 or 1000 extra hands in rebuilding a community after a disaster and the inmates would learn valuable construction skills and on-the-job training as part of their rehabilitation Hodgson said Jonathan Darling a spokesman for the sheriffs office told The Washington_Post on Thursday that getting Project NICE off the ground will be a top priorityforHodgson during his next six years in officeDarling saidHodgson has been speaking withother sheriffs about his plan for a national network of inmate workers which woulddivide the country into four regions Then when a natural disaster strikesDarling said inmates in thatarea who have volunteered to be in the program would respondAlthoughHodgson did_not say Wednesday who would pay to transport and secure inmates on-siteDarling said the sheriff is hoping to partner with theFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) an arm of theDepartment of Homeland_Security anduse federal funding to help cover those costsNow that the sheriff has announced his plan for Project NICE he is working to make it official Darling saidThe Bristol County Sheriffs Department will soon give a formal presentation at the annual meeting for the National Sheriffs AssociationThe sheriffs office has reached out to Trumps transition_team to formally offer to help build the wall sheriffs officials had not heard back as of Thursday morning Darling said Trump officials did_not immediately respond to a request for comment The proposal has drawn rebuke from the American Civil Liberties Union in Massachusetts which called the sheriffs plan perverseIts inhumane and its most_likely unconstitutional Laura Rtolo staff counsel with the ACLU Its also likely an attempt by Sheriff Hodgson just to ride this wave and become famous nationally I_hope we dont have to take this proposal seriouslyRtolo saidthe ACLU is prepared to take the sheriff to court over the matterIf Sheriff Hodgson follows through on this gimmick the ACLU of Massachusetts is prepared to use every tool in our toolbox including litigation to stop him Rtolo told the newspaper The wall itself is based on racism and hatred and no self-respecting Massachusetts official should have anything to do with itThe idea of using modern-day slave labor to send people thousands of miles away from their Massachusetts home to build a wall to keep out other vulnerable populations its just preposterous she addedDarling the Bristol County Sheriffs Department spokesmanstressed that only inmates who volunteer for the work program will becalled onWe would never force them to do it he saidDarling called it a benefit for qualifying prisoners inBristol County (and beyond) totake part in existing inmate work programs which help shave time off their sentences and give them vocational skills they can use oncethey are released He noted however that the Bristol County Sheriffs Departmentdoesnt send violent offenders to help through the inmate work program nor would it expect other departments to do so through Project NICEAsked about the border wallDarling said the sheriff thought it would be a good project for the inmatesHodgson he said hopesto

moon landing What really happened in Roswell And where are Biggie and TupacAt the time Obama joked about Trumps experience to lead the nation All kidding aside obviously we all know about your credentials and breadth of experience Obama said For_example no seriously just recently in an episode of Celebrity Apprentice at the steakhouse the mens cooking team did_not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks And there was a lot of blame to go around but you Mr Trump recognized that the problem was a lack of leadership and so ultimately you didnt blame Little John or Meatloaf you fired Gary

rejected his attorneys appeal to have the case dismissed over incendiary remarks made by President Trump during his campaign for the White HouseIt was never my intention for anyone to be hurt said Bergdahl 31 while reading from prepared remarks He apologized for the horrible mistake of abandoning his post in Afghanistan and endangering other US troops tasked with finding him after his disappearance in 2009 They suffered he said because of my bad choicesBergdahl has pleaded_guilty to desertion and misbehavior_before the enemy He faces life in prisonHis testimony came as the judge Army Col Jeffery R Nance weighs Trumps comments the president has called Bergdahl a dirty rotten traitor and suggested he should be executed against the horrific treatment Bergdahl endured while in captivity and the testimony of other troops who were wounded during the search Though Nance denied Bergdahls motion to dismiss the case he said he would consider Trumps comments as mitigating evidence that could lessen the punishment Bergdahl receives if any During his testimony Bergdahl described his torture his failed escape attempts his declining health and his dimming prospects for survivalIn detailing his captivity he explained that dirt floors were preferable to cement because they allowed him to bury the chronic diarrhea he experienced thus avoiding further abuse from angry guards who threatened to cut_off his nose and ears if he did_not stop getting sick He was beat with hoses and kept in a cage much of the time he saidAs he recalled his ordeal one memory caused him to start shaking His face turned red But rather_than tell the court what had surfaced in his mind Bergdahl elected to stop But the court also heard Monday from the prosecutions final witness Shannon Allen whose husband Mark a former master sergeant in the National Guard was nearly killed while searching for Bergdahl Allen was paralyzed after being shot in the head to collect intelligence on Bergdahls whereaboutsHe was very loud and outgoing Allen said about her_husband before he was wounded Areas of his brain that affect memory and motor skills were removed in surgery she said and he can no_longer

said her voice shakingThe court was shown a video of Allen readying her_husband for the day as he lay nearly motionless The defense team had objected to scheduling Allens testimony saying the impact on her was too far removed from Bergdahls actions to be considered a factor in his sentencing But Nance allowed it saying her testimony conveyed how one soldiers life has been permanently altered Bergdahl watched the video And he too offered how his actions in 2009 have bled into the present where flashbacks and hyper-vigilance he said grip him day and nightHe works an administration job at

are concerned will be used to observe Chinese airspaceWe firmly oppose the deployment of THAAD said Geng_Shuang a spokesman for Chinas Foreign_Ministry at a daily press briefing in Beijing on Tuesday We will resolutely take necessary measures to defend our security interestsAll the consequences from this will be borne by the US and the ROK he added referring to South_Korea We strongly urge relevant parties to stop deploying it and not travel down the wrong pathSouth Koreas left-wing opposition parties also sharply criticized the governments unilateral rushed move to deploy the THAAD_battery ahead of scheduleThe government has completely disregarded public calls and demands from political circles with regard to the THAAD_deployment said Youn Kwan-suk the spokesman for the Democratic PartyFrom the clandestine push for the deployment to the process of making the final decision on the installation the government has unilaterally pressed ahead with it without any consultations with citizens he said according to the Yonhap news agencySeveral key details of the deployment have not yet been finalized and the land where the battery will be housed is not yet ready opposition politicians said But South_Korean defense officials said they would keep the equipment at the US air base at Osan until the site is readyWhen Seoul and Washington agreed last_year on the THAAD unit they were aiming for deployment by the end of July although it had been expedited and was expected to arrive between June and AugustWith the arrival of the first components they could have it up and running sooner The deployment could be completed within one or two months and it can be operational as early as April a South_Korean military official told_reporters in SeoulConservative politicians said that North_Koreas latest missile_launches underscored the urgent need for THAADWe welcome the right decision to deploy THAAD when North_Korea threatens the security of the Republic of Korea and Northeast Asia by firing as many as four ballistic_missiles said Kim Sung-won the spokesman for the ruling Liberty Korea PartyThe timing is politically sensitive because the president Park_Geun-hye is likely to find out this week whether she will be impeached The Constitutional_Court is expected to issue its decision as soon as Friday on whether to uphold a parliamentary motion to force Park out of office over a corruption scandalMoon Jae-in the leading liberal candidate for the presidency has said he would respect agreements between governments but he has also suggested that he might ask parliament to revisit the THAAD deploymentThe United_States and South_Korea began discussing the deployment of THAAD more_than a year ago and reached an agreement to do so in July Then-President to the deployment in October saying Washington and Seoul have worked together to prepare for any threat He specifically cited THAAD as an example while calling it a purely defensive system to deter and defend against North_Korean threatsDefense Secretary_Jim Mattis made his first trip as Pentagon chief to Seoul and Tokyo in January and said then that he anticipated THAAD would arrive in South_Korea this yearThe news of on Monday elicited cheers in Ukraine where activists and politicians seeking to root out political corruption had seethed at the American political operatives counsel to the countrys ousted leader Viktor YanukovychReports of the millions of dollars Manafort had been paid under the table by Ukraines formerruling party were particularly galling and Ukrainians learned from the indictment Monday those payments may have been even larger than thoughtBut while Washington is wondering where the into Russian_meddling in the US elections will lead next people here are wondering more about what this means for the investigation_into the millions of dollars in oligarch wealth that have stubbornly slowed the countrys program of reformIts great news There should be a precedent of punishment for the lobbyists who served these corrupt figures said Serhiy Leshchenko a Ukrainian member of parliament and investigative journalist who published documents showing secret payments to Manafort by the ruling party under Yanukovych and then invoices to Manafort consulting companies on the same dayManafort worked for a long time so that Yanukovych could come to power and use that power for his own corrupt schemes not for reformThe investigation as he saw it is far from finished I want investigations into all of Manaforts connections and the people who paid him this money he added naming several prominent Ukrainian oligarchsIn a decades-long career Manafort made tens of millions of dollars far beyond the borders of established democracies working for despotic leaders and their allies in countries such as the Philippines and CongoBut his work in one country Ukraine caught up with him on Monday in a criminal indictment describing illicit earnings offshore bank_accounts and lavish expenditures funded in part by nearly a decade of work for Ukraines Party of Regions and Yanukovych who fled to Russia after his regime was toppled by protesters in 2014Despite reports of secret payments Mondays 12-count_indictment against Manafort and a former business_partner still yielded newaccusations for Ukrainian prosecutors investigating the former Yanukovych administrationAmong them lobbying members of Congress for the Ukrainian government in one case using an offshore account to secretly funnel $4 million to commission a report about the trial of former Ukrainian prime_minister Yulia Tymoshenko This was new information for us Serhiy Gorbatyuk the head of special investigations for the prosecutors office said in a telephone interviewIt took an unlikely confluence of events the 2014 political revolution in Ukraine that ousted Yanukovych the discovery of secret campaign finance documents at the headquarters of Ukraines ruling Party of Regions and then Manaforts leading role as campaign_manager for President Trump for Mueller to zero in on Manaforts alleged schemes to launder money evade US taxes and engage in conspiracy against the United StatesIn Kiev where politicians have been careful the Trump administration Manafort remains just a witness as prosecutors pursue corruption charges_against the Yanukovych administration Gorbatyuk said his requests to the US Justice_Department to cooperate had not received a responseIn order for the case to move_forward better we need answers to our questions So far we havent received any Manafort at this moment is a witness in the case he saidWhile in Kiev the extent of Manaforts wealth was not Mondays indictment alleged that more_than $75 million flowed through offshore_accounts Manafort and his partner_Rick Gates maintained and that Manafort sent more_than $54million to vendors for home improvements and $934350 to an antique rug store It alleged as well that he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars more on antiques landscaping Range Rovers and home entertainment systemsHe made that money while working for some of the regions richest men including Russian oligarch Deripaska in a 2014 Cayman Islands court filing had accused Manafort and Gates of absconding with $19 million of his money earmarked for investments Yet in 2016 Manafort had suggested providing Deripaska with private briefings while he was Trumps campaign chairmanBut the focus of Mondays indictment was the money Manafort made working as a political adviser in Ukraine developing the election strategies that helped revive the political career of Yanukovych from a bitter defeat in a contested 2004 presidential_election up until his ouster by pro-European street demonstrators in 2014Party allies recalled that Manafort coached unpolished politicians from the countrys industrial regions streamlining their talking_points and improving their choice in suits Others said he helped parse demographic polls to take_advantage of the deep divide between the countrys regionsOn Monday allies and associates of Manaforts in Ukraine where he remains a deeply divisive figure brushed off the allegations calling them the result of a politically motivated witch_hunt following Trumps unexpected ascendancy to the presidencyI have every confidence that Paul and Rick will be vindicated by the judicial process currently ongoing in the US said Philip Griffin Manaforts longtime representative in Ukraine I am quite taken by the fact that this has nothing to do with the president or any alleged collusion_between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia and that this is the result of a politically driven fishing expeditionPrevious records from a recovered black ledger of payments to Manafort from Ukraines Party of Regions detailed payments of $127 million but Mondays indictment said Manafort had laundered a larger amount more_than $18 million Manafort pleaded not guilty Monday to the 12 counts brought against himWhile Manafort allies focused on the absence of collusion allegations in the indictment the charges still sent shock waves through his network of partners and associates Speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly one associate called them a punch to the gutThe UN_Security Council unanimously adopted harsh sanctions Wednesday against North_Korea imposing some of the strongest measures ever used to pressure Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear_weapons programThe new sanctions come two months after North_Korea and a month after it conducted what was widely described as a banned missile_test under the guise of But US officials began drafting the measures three years_ago soon after North_Korea conducted a previous nuclear_test in order to move swiftly the next time it happened Negotiations to win Chinas support began two days after North_Koreas January nuclear_test its fourth in a decadeThe resolution is far more sweeping than existing sanctions requiring a link to proliferation activities That precondition has been removed in effect erasing the presumption of innocence It mandates cargo inspections for all goods going in and out of North_Korea by land sea or air chokes off supplies of most aviation fuel for its armed_forces and bans the sale of all small arms and conventional weapons to Pyongyang It also prohibits transactions that raise hard cash for North_Korea through sales of its natural resourcesThe resolution doubles the blacklist of people and institutions already sanctioned and requires countries to expel North_Korean diplomats involved in any sanctioned activitiesOne provision was designed to prevent Pyongyang from sending taekwondo instructors to train foreign police forces Another bars North_Koreans from specialized training at any school or research center in the world if the learning can advance Pyongyangs nuclear and ballistic_missile programsPresident Obama welcomed the sanctions as a firm and appropriate response to North_Koreas attempts to develop weapons of mass destructionToday the international_community speaking with one voice has sent Pyongyang a simple message North_Korea must abandon these dangerous programs and choose a better path for its people he saidAs soon as the sanctions were released the Treasury Department and the State_Department updated their blacklists of people and entities tied to the Democratic_Peoples Republic of Korea the official name for North_Korea and its proliferation programs The designation freezes their US assets and bars Americans from doing business with themThe UN sanctions which target the countrys elites and avoid adverse humanitarian consequences for civilians aim to accomplish what worked with less onerous sanctions on Iran by pushing theto quit pumping money into its nuclear_program The chronic suffering of the people of North_Korea is the direct result of the choices made by the DPRK government a government that has consistently prioritized its nuclear_weapons and ballistic_missile programs over providing for the most basic needs of its own people said Samantha Power the US ambassador to the United NationsThe North_Korean government would rather grow its nuclear_weapons program than grow its own children she addedThe resolution was presented by the United_States with the support of China a sharp reversal given Beijings longtime support of its neighbor Although the United_States has long had an embargo on trade with North_Korea China has provided food and fuel and has been a key trading partner In recent_years living conditions in North_Korea have improved thanks in large part to ChinaIn the past China has been unwilling to tighten the screws on Pyongyang in part out of concern for what an imploding unstable North_Korea might mean for Chinas own border But recently North_Korea has continued testing new weapons and missiles disregarding Chinas warnings and personal envoysAfter North_Korea on Jan 6 detonated a new device calling it a hydrogen_bomb although most experts say it was a smaller nuclear device Chinas ambassador to six-party talks Wu Dawei went to Pyongyang to urge restraint Instead North_Korea announced while he was there that it would test a missileChinas about-face suggests it has started to realize that doing nothing would impose growing political costs internationally the possibility of a greater US presence in the region and weaker relations with South_Korea which Beijing has been cultivatingI expect theres been a delayed recognition in China to the political price China was paying with South_Korea in particular for its equivocation or outright silence about how to respond to North_Korea and North_Korea actions said Jonathan Pollack a specialist on East Asian politics and security at the Brookings Institution During a visit to Washington last_month Chinese Foreign_Minister Wang Yi hinted at the strains in policy toward North KoreaOn the one hand were saying to the international_community that the normal exchanges especially those affecting the livelihoods of the North_Korean people should not be adversely affected he said at the Center for Strategic and International_Studies On the other hand in order to uphold the international nuclear nonproliferation regime for the sake of denuclearization our exchanges will be affected to some extentBut some analysts question the depth of Chinas commitment to the latest round of sanctionsThe real question going forward is whether China will enforce the new measures said Victor Cha a professor at Georgetown University My guess is that China will squeeze for a little_bit but not too hard while the US will want China to squeeze harder and for a longer period of timeSung-Yoon Lee a Korean studies professor at Tufts University said the UN sanctions even if violated in the future will become increasingly meaningful if ordinary citizens in North_Korea are adversely affectedThe fact the UN is involved will lend greater legitimacy to the effort to sanction North_Korea and enable others like Japan and Europe to shoulder some of the blame if there are negative repercussions from sanctions so the blame doesnt just fall on the shoulders of the United_States he saidPreparatory work on the sanctions began in early 2013 immediately after the Security_Council passed a sanctions resolution in response to North_Koreas third nuclear_test according to a State_Department official who spoke about the sensitive negotiations on the condition of anonymity US officials concluded that incrementally ratcheting up sanctions was insufficient and that more restrictive measures were needed the official saidAs technical experts from many government agencies met to share ideas a contingency draft of sanctions was repeatedly updated to be ready for a fourth_nuclear test by North_Korea On Jan 8 two days after North_Korea announced the fourth test diplomats from the US mission to the United_Nations presented a draft to the Chinese mission There was little response during January as China studied the proposed sanctions which dropped requirements to prove proliferation links as China had insisted on previouslyChina did_not change its position during a Jan 27 visit to Beijing by Secretary of State John_F Kerry or during a Feb 5 phone_call that Obama placed to Chinese President_Xi JinpingBut after the Feb 7 missile_test the State_Department official said the Chinese came around to the US point of view Throughout much of February US and Chinese diplomats met several_times a day to discuss provisions that had to be approved by Beijing the official saidAt 8 or 9 at night diplomats at the US mission would schlep to the Chinese mission the State_Department official said Then they would meet again the next_day after Beijing had worked through the provisions overnightAfter a tentative agreement was reached early last_week US officials had hoped for a quick adoption by the Security_Council But there were delays while Russia studied the sanctions to gauge their impact Russia transports coal over a short stretch of railroad in North_Korea to a port and Moscow wanted reassurances it would not be banned the official saidIn recent_days North_Korea has boasted that more sanctions would not hurt Now China South_Korea Japan and the United_States are awaiting its reaction Early Thursday hours after the sanctions were approved the North fired short-range projectiles into the sea South_Koreas Defense_Ministry saidWeve seen its reckless and unpredictable acts for years Power said Weve seen threats directed at the continental United_States and the Republic of Korea Weve seen cyberattacks on American companies costing hundreds of millions of dollars We do not expect a change of behavior overnightPresident Trump woke before dawn on Monday and burrowed in at the White_House residence to wait for the Russia bombshell he knew was comingSeparated from most of his West_Wing staff who fretted over why he was late getting to the Oval_Office Trump clicked on the television and spent the morning playing fuming media critic legal analyst and crisis communications strategist according to several people close to himThe president digested the news of the first indictments in special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_IIIs probe with exasperation and disgust these people said He called his lawyers repeatedly He listened intently to cable news commentary And with rising irritation he watched live footage of his onetime campaign adviser and confidant Paul_Manafort turning himself in to the FBIInitially Trump felt vindicated Though frustrated that the media were linking him to the indictment and tarnishing his presidency he cheered that the charges_against Manafort and his deputy_Rick Gates were focused primarily on activities that began before his campaign Trump tweeted at 1028 am there is NO COLLUSIONBut the presidents celebration was short-lived A few minutes later court_documents were unsealed showing that George_Papadopoulos an unpaid foreign_policy adviser on Trumps campaign pleaded_guilty to making a false statement to the FBI about his efforts to broker a relationship between Trump and Russian President_Vladimir Putin The case provides the clearest evidence yet of links_between Trumps campaign and Russian officialsFor a president who revels in chaos and in orchestrating it himself Monday brought a political storm that Trump could not control White_House Chief of Staff_John F_Kelly along with lawyers Ty Cobb John Dowd and Jay Sekulow advised Trump to be cautious with his public responses but they were a private sounding board for his grievances advisers saidThis has not been a cause of great agita or angst or activity at the White_House said Cobb the White_House lawyer overseeing Russia matters He added that Trump is spending all of his time on presidential work But Trumps anger Monday was visible to those who interacted with him and the mood in the corridors of the White_House was one of weariness and fear of the unknown As the president groused upstairs many staffers some of whom have hired lawyers to help them navigate Muellers investigation privately speculated about where the special_counsel might turn nextThe walls are closing in said one senior Republican in close contact with top staffers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly Everyone is freaking outTrump is also increasingly agitated by the expansion of Muellers probe into financial issues beyond the 2016 campaign and about the potential damage to him and his familyThis portrait of Trump and his White_House on a day of crisis is based on interviews with 20 senior administration officials Trump friends and key outside allies many of whom insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive internal mattersTrump and his aides were frustrated that yet again Russia steamrolled the start of a carefully planned week of policy news Trump is preparing to nominate a new chairman of the Federal_Reserve and is scheduled to depart Friday for a high-stakes 12-day trip across Asia and House Republicans are planning to unveil their tax overhaul billId like to start the briefing today by addressing a topic that I know all of you are preparing to ask me about and thats tax reform White_House press_secretary Sarah_Huckabee Sanders said at Monday afternoons news briefing It was a lighthearted prelude to a question-and-answer session immediately overtaken by queries about the indictmentsAway from the podium Trump staffers fretted privately over whether Manafort or Gates might share with Muellers_team damaging_information about other colleagues They expressed concern in particular about Gates because he has a young family may be more stretched financially than Manafort and continued to be involved in Trumps political operation and had access to the White_House including attending West_Wing meetings after Trump was sworn inSome White_House advisers are unhappy with Thomas J Barrack Jr Trumps longtime friend and chairman of his inauguration whom they hold responsible for keeping Gates in the Trump orbit long after Manafort resigned as campaign_chairman in August 2016 according to people_familiar with the situation Barrack has been Gatess patron of late steering political work to him and until Monday employing him as director of the Washington office of his real_estate investment companyTrump and his aides tried to shrug off the ominous headlines decorating the South Portico of the White_House in black bats and faux spider webs to welcome costumed children for Halloween trick-or-treating As the sun set on Monday the president and first_lady Melania Trump handed out goody bags to little princesses and pirates The Russia drama has been distracting and damaging for Trump from a public relations perspective if not eventually a legal one The presidents inner_circle on Russia matters has tightened in recent months In_addition to his lawyers Trump has been talking mostly with Kelly and members of his family including Melania as well as daughter_Ivanka and son-in-law_Jared Kushner both senior White_House advisers Trump also leans on two senior aides counselor Kellyanne_Conway and communications director Hope Hicks as well as some outside friends for adviceStill Trump has little ability to influence the ongoing Russia probe save for firing Mueller the sort of rash decision that his lawyers insisted Monday he is not consideringNothing about todays events alters anything related to our engagement with the special_counsel with whom we continue to cooperate Cobb said There are no discussions and there is no consideration being given to terminating MuellerSekulow one of Trumps outside lawyers said Theres_no firing-Robert-Mueller discussionsAsked whether Trump is considering pardons for Manafort or Gates Cobb said No no no Thats never come up and wont come upOn Capitol_Hill meanwhile some of Trumps allies are privately revving up their own version of a counterattack against Mueller Several top Republican legislators plan to raise questions in the coming days about the FBIs handling of a dossier detailing alleged ties_between Trump and Russian interests They intend to argue that Muellers_team has become overly reliant on a document that was funded in part by Democrats according to two people involved in the discussions Mueller does_not appear to have relied on the dossier for the cases revealed on Monday howeverFor Trump and his team the bad news began as disconcerting drips last Friday when CNN first reported that indictments were probably coming Monday The only question of whomThe White_House had no inside information beyond what was public in news reports officials said and was left to scramble and speculate as to what might happen Reliable information was hard to come by as Trumps team was scattered Cobb was at his home in South Carolina until Monday afternoon while Trump spent much of Saturday at his private golf club in Virginia and went out to dinner with Melania and their son Barron at the Trump International Hotels steakhouse in WashingtonAmong the many unknowns the Trump team arrived at an educated guess that Manafort was likely to be indicted in part according to one White_House aide because of reports that television news crews were preparing to stake out Manaforts Virginia homeThis wasnt a shocking development Sekulow said When the first pair of indictments came naming Manafort and Gates there was palpable relief inside the West_Wing The 31-page document did_not name Trump nor did it address any possible collusion_between Russia and the presidents campaignMoreover aides were simply happy that the initial batch of indictments did_not include Michael_Flynn Trumps former and controversial national_security adviser who was fired from his top White_House perch after misleading Vice_President Pence about his contacts with Russian officials Flynn had been intimately involved in both the campaign and the early days of the administration and a Flynn indictment most staff believed would have been far more damagingThe indictment of Gates who had played a quiet behind-the-scenes role in Trumps orbit was more of a surprise though he had served as Manaforts campaign deputy and protege Trumps team quickly settled on a messaging plan The duos alleged misdeeds the White_House argued had nothing to do with the president or his campaignPrivately aides and allies acknowledged that the campaign had perhaps not sufficiently vetted the two_men before bringing them on boardMichael Caputo a former campaign adviser whom Trump praised Monday morning on Twitter for his appearance on Fox_News Channels Fox & Friends later called the indictments one big huge failRick and Paul I would consider them friends of the president because they worked so closely with him Caputo said The presidents watching closely and he should be concerned for his friends welfare but he has absolutely no concern about collusion with Russia because there was noneOn Sunday Trump had attempted to seek refuge from the political squall with another_round of golf at his Virginia club Sens Lindsey O Graham (R-SC) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis) were set to join him according to two people briefed on the plans an afternoon of camaraderie and talk about his tax proposalIt was not to be Rainy weather forced the White_House to cancel the outing yet_another disappointment beyond the presidents control John Wagner contributed to this reportAs the United_States has looked for various ways to punish North_Korea for its nuclear intransigence one factor has remained constant ChinaFinancial transactions mineral exports luxury imports all of them come through China making the nations enforcement of international sanctions critical to their successA once-reluctant to inflict pain on Pyongyang this year But that could be changing the unintended result of the United_States and South_Koreas to protect against North KoreaChina has been complaining about this at the highest_levels said Scott Snyder a Korea expert at the Council on Foreign_Relations Will this be a factor that diminishes their implementation of UN_Security Council resolutionsPresident Park Geun-hyes administration in Seoul had been equivocating on whether to host a Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defense_(THAAD) antimissile unit for the US military fearful of angering Beijing China is South_Koreas biggest trading partner with its bilateral trade worth twice as much as that with the United_States But North_Koreas recent actions its nuclear_test and long-range missile_launch at the beginning of this year prompted Seoul to agree in July to host the battery Early Wednesday the North was reported to have test-fired a submarine-launched_ballistic missile off its east coastBeijing which views the THAAD_deployment as a way to keep China in check has taken a range of actions recently to express its displeasure The United_States has a strategic plot to destabilize regional security the state-run Peoples Daily said in an editorial shortly_after the decisionSo far this month Beijing has suspended operations of the travel agency that helped South Koreans get multiple-entry visas for China a visa used especially by those doing business with 300000 issued a year and tourism has been hitOne tour-bus company told South_Koreas CNBC channel that 30 to 40_percent of reservations had been canceled while the Dong-A newspaper quoted travel firms as saying that Chinese tour package reservations for September and October were one-fifth lower than the same months last yearSome South_Korean actors who star in dramas that are popular in China have had their public appearances canceled and some here even saw THAAD behind the Chinese city of Qingdaos last-minute decision to cancel its participation in a chicken-and-beer festival in its South_Korean sister city of Daegu Throughout North_Koreas decades of malfeasance Chinas overarching concern has been to ensure that its irascible neighbor remains intact and does_not spill hungry refugees or nuclear material over its borderBut in the past few years Beijing has shown signs of cracking down on the Kim_Jong Un regime most recently in March when it supported the UN_Security Council resolution to impose tough new sanctions on mining exports in particular on PyongyangHopes that China would follow through with implementation appear however to have been short-livedChinese customs data showed that bilateral trade with North_Korea was valued at $504million in June three months after the sanctions were imposed and the month before the THAAD announcement That is almost 10percent higher than the year beforeTrade has continued at a brisk pace in the past two months said Lim Eul-chul of Kyungnam Universitys Graduate School of North_Korean StudiesChinese companies that had held back on trading with the North have started to ship more goods after hearing the news that Seoul-Beijing relations have taken a turn for the worse over the THAAD issue Lim told the Yonhap_News Agency The effort to squeeze the North has probably been neutralized by THAAD and the Chinese response Snyder saidThe THAAD decision had coincided with other US moves to sanction Kim by name to designate North_Korea as a primary money_laundering concern and to endorse an international ruling rejecting Chinas claim to the South China SeaEven if each decision may have been correct on its own Snyder said the four things together project an image of US policy that is clearly not well received in BeijingKim Sook a former South_Korean ambassador to the United_Nations agreedTHAAD happened at the same_time as the South China_Sea decision so China might have been doubly disappointed he said adding that the South_Korean decision to host the missile battery was the right one even if the timing was offStrategically our government has mishandled the case Kim said They hesitated for three years when they should have moved swiftlyA trio of watchdog groups has asked the US attorney for the Southern_District of New_York to investigate whether President Trump has received payments or other benefits from foreign_governments through his business_interests in violation of an obscure clause in the US Constitution The request sent by letter Wednesday morning to is a novel strategy by ethics critics who have been pressing Trump to comply with the Constitutions emoluments_clause which prohibits top officials from receiving payments or favors from foreign_governments Trumps business_empire stretches across the globe The letter was sent six weeks after one of the groups filed a lawsuit in federal district court making a similar claimTrump has said he addressed ethics concerns by turning over management of his business to his adult sons whove said they have separated the family business from their relationship with their father and the US governmentThere are lines we would never cross in a recent interview and thats mixing business with anything government On Wednesday the White_House referred questions to the Trump_Organization where attorney Alan Garten dismissed the letter as factually inaccurate legally erroneous and politically motivatedAlthough the president has relinquished day-to-day management of his businesses his critics say his continued ownership interest means he effectively receives benefits from foreign entities in violation of the Constitution The ethics advocates mostly Democrats have held news_conferences and filed a lawsuit Now they are asking one of the countrys leading federal_prosecutors for helpWe call on you as the United_States Attorney for the jurisdiction where The Trump_Organization is located to exercise your responsibility to investigate and take appropriate action to ensure that the Trump_Organization and related Trump business enterprises do not receive payments and financial benefits from foreign_governments that benefit President Trump the letter said It is signed by Fred Wertheimer president of Democracy 21 bipartisan leaders of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington organization (CREW) and Paul Smith of the Campaign Legal Center It cannot be the case that the president can flagrantly violate the Constitution and get away with it said Norman L Eisen who served as ethics counsel under President_Barack Obama Eisen who signed the letter as chairman of CREW acknowledged that asking a US attorney to investigate a matter involving a sitting president is unusual But he said having a president with these conflicts is also unprecedented The letter is also signed by CREWs vice chair Richard Painter who served as ethics counsel to President George_W BushIn January CREW in federal district court arguing that his continued receipt of payments from foreign entities violated the Constitutions emoluments_clause Trumps reply in that case is due April 1 Eisen said the request to the US attorney should not be seen as a sign that the suit will not move_forward We believe our complaint in the judicial branch should not exclude review by the other branches of government he said citing the importance of the emoluments restrictionThat clause says that no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under [the United States] shall without the Consent of the Congress accept of any present Emolument Office or Title of any kind whatever from any King Prince or foreign State It was written in to Article I out of concern that the fledgling countrys leaders could be influenced by a wealthy European power The meaning of the clause The watchdog groups say the text should be interpreted to mean that Trumps businesses should cease commercial transactions with foreign statesThe letter notes that China recently granted Trump a trademark for building construction services It also points out that tenants of Trump_Tower in New_York include a Chinese bank and the Abu Dhabi Tourism and Culture Authority and that the Trump hotel in Washington has been courting business from foreign diplomats The document notes that Trumps business entities have plans to build luxury hotels in China and that it is also engaged in real_estate and licensing projects in India Indonesia the Philippines Saudi_Arabia Scotland Taiwan and Turkey We believe the Justice_Department has a broad mandate to ensure compliance with provisions of the Constitution that relate to Federal officeholders the letter said The letter noted testimony of Attorney_General Jeff_Sessions in his confirmation hearings Sessions stated that although he was not aware of a federal law that directly charges the Justice_Department with enforcing the emoluments_clause he recognized that the Justice_Department has the responsibility to ensure that officeholders comply with their constitutional obligationsWertheimer said that the request was made because he sees a powerful record that President Trump is receiving benefits that do not comply with the emoluments_clause He and other signers said Bharara was chosen in part because he is known for fierce independence Since he was appointed in 2009 he has investigated New_York Gov Andrew M Cuomo and New_York City Mayor Bill De Blasio both Democrats Although Bharara was appointed by Obama after the election and asked him to stay on as US attorneyA tearful University of Virginia student detained in North_Korea confessed in a highly orchestrated news_conference Monday to the very severe and pre-planned crime of trying to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel in Pyongyang had not been seen since on Jan2 at the end of a five-day tour to North_Korea The trip was a stopover on his way to Hong_Kong where he was to take part in a university-sponsored financial classBut it wasnt until three weeks later that Kim_Jong Uns_regime announced it was holding the Ohio native for an unspecified hostile act against the state In the meantime North_Korea has conducted a nuclear_test and a long-range missile_launch inflaming tensions with the outside worldEscorted by North_Korean guards into a news_conference in Pyongyang on Monday Warmbier reading from handwritten notes said he had tried to steal a political sign promoting the [North] Korean peoples love for their system from the hotel The aim of my task was to harm the motivation and work ethic of the Korean people This was a very foolish aim Warmbier said He was wearing a beige jacket with a shirt and tie and was cleanshaven He appeared to be in good healthAmericans who previously have been detained in North_Korea have also been with the detainees told what to say and the reporters told what to ask After saying he had made the worst mistake of my_life as he asked for forgiveness Warmbier performed a deep bow in front of the mainly North_Korean reportersAnalysts say Warmbier was probably told what to say and how to deliver the bizarre statement in which the student said he was impressed by North_Koreas humanitarian treatment of severe criminals like myself and referred to the connivance of the United_States administrationSuch confessions which are repeatedly played on North_Korean television for domestic propaganda purposes are usually a necessary step before detainees can be releasedHowever recent detainees have had to go through a show trial and conviction before being freedWarmbiers parents Fred and Cindy have not been able to contact their son since his arrest and released a statement through U-Va in which they urged North_Korea to release himI hope the fact that he has conveyed his sincere apology for anything that he may have done wrong will now make it possible for the DPRK authorities to allow him to return home the statement said using the official acronym for North_Korea and written in the voice of Fred I urge the DPRK government to consider his youth and make an important humanitarian gesture by allowing him to return to his loved onesIn his appearance before the media Otto Warmbier said he had been instructed by a female member of Friendship United Methodist Church in Wyoming Ohio to steal one of North_Koreas ubiquitous propaganda signs and take it back to the United_States as a trophyAll across North_Korea from factories and government offices to hillsides and intersections there are propangandistic slogans lauding the ruling Kim regime which maintains power through an all-encompassing personality cult Speaking ill of the Kims or even folding a newspaper so the leaders face is halved is treasonousTaking the banner would harm the unity and motivation of the North_Korean people and show this country an insult from the West Warmbier said adding that the plan had the US governments approval The church member would give him a used car worth $10000 if he stole the sign and would pay $200000 to his mother if he was arrested in the processWarmbier said his familys very severe financial difficulties made him do it I started to consider this as my only golden opportunity to earn money he said adding that his family would not be paid if he mentioned the churchs

by the American Dream the narrator says The commercial which the Latino_Victory Fund says is airing through Election_Day on Spanish-language stations in Richmond and Washington market is the latest in a bitter battle on the airwaves Gillespie a longtime GOP operative has launched ads seeking to tie his Democratic_opponent Ralph_Northam to and a who briefly got his rights restored The Republican

hate Republicans blasted that mailer and accused Northam of exploiting the deadly violence in Charlottesville for political gain They also note that Gillespie repeatedly condemned the white_supremacists of Charlottesville But Democrats have responded that Gillespies campaign has commercials have amplified stereotypes about Latinos and that the candidate never explicitly condemned

disappointed by his ad campaign Hes a Republican reformer Portman told the Post He goes everywhere hell talk to everybody I_think hell be a national leaderGerman voters on Sunday appeared to send a message to Chancellor_Angela Merkel Close the door on migrantsHer center-right Christian Democratic_Party suffered universal setbacks in local elections in a vote widely seen as a referendum on Merkels humanitarian stance allowing vast waves of migrants to cross German bordersThe upstart Alternative for Germany (AfD) party a populist force that campaigned on an anti-migrant anti-Merkel platform and which drew support from the left as well as the right scored big gains It landed 244 percent of the vote in one of the three states that went to the ballot box according to projections based on exit polls produced for the German public broadcaster ARD The outcome amounted to a blow to Merkel just as the chancellor is set to fight this week for a new accord between the European_Union and Turkey on the refugee crisis It would stop the illegal flow of migrants across the Aegean Sea but also compel reluctant European nations including Germany to take in more Syrian asylum seekers from TurkeyAt home Merkel has already vowed to speed up deportations of migrants who are not fleeing war In the past 12 months more_than a million migrants from the Middle_East and beyond have sought sanctuary and jobs in Europes economic powerhouse Yet in a sign that public tolerance may be growing thin voter turnout was up Sunday and above 70 percent in two of the states voting The results will probably further fuel the existing unease with Merkel within her own CDU said Carsten Nickel senior vice_president of Teneo IntelligenceThe CDUs worst losses of the night came in Baden-Wuerttemberg where her party was falling to 27 percent support a record low The CDU had held sway in the state for most of the post-World War_II era but ended the night down 12 percentage points from its last showingThe CDU also lost ground but less about 3 percentage points in the states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt Importantly one of the CDUs rising stars Julia Klckner was failing in her bid to unseat the incumbent for Rhineland-Palatinates top jobAt the same_time the AfD a party that sought to tap the anxiety of Germans over the wave of newcomers made strong gains The party drew voters to the polls who had rarely or never participated in elections Projections showed it winning more_than 24 percent in Saxony-Anhalt located in the former East Germany where anti-migrant sentiment is running particularly high The AfD also gained ground in the two other states with preliminary results showing it won 126 percent of the vote in Rhineland-Palatinate and 151 percent in wealthy heavily industrialized Baden-Wuerttemberg Nevertheless analysts predicted that Merkel who has defended her plan to shelter war-torn refugees while weeding out economic migrants probably would hold firm She has the luxury of claiming that key local CDU politicians including Klckner who failed on Sunday have criticized her refugee policy They lost to opposition politicians who sometimes had been more supportive of the chancellors refugee policy than members of her own partyWhen it comes to the refugee crisis Merkel might change her tone but not her politics said Jrgen Falter a political analyst at Mainz University She seems to be so utterly convinced of her strategy that I do not expect her to do anything different unless her European partners force her to Stephanie Kirchner contributed to this reportThere are three reasons the Trump dossier has been elevated as one of the central points of consideration in the public investigation of Russian_meddling in the 2016_presidential campaignThe first is that it involves the characters and language of a John Le Carr novel a former_British intelligence_officer communing with shadowy Muscovites identified only by letters and detailing secret meetings in exotic places hidden payments and illegal agreements to seize the American presidencyThe second is that the political stakes are high The dossiers roots lie with an picking up an effort begun by an unnamed Republican client in the primary but accelerated with the hiring of the Briton Christopher_Steele Steele compiled the 35-page document that was ultimately and how and why he did so has been nailed down only recentlyThe third reason people have paid so much attention to it is the unproven assertion generally described as salacious that Trump was party to a particular event in a Moscow hotel room You already know what Im referring to so I wont get into itThat assertion is unproven as are many of the other claims in the document That includes the overarching claim that Russian_government officials allied with Trump employees and campaign aides to help his election But the importance of assessing that claim has led Trump supporters to dismiss the dossier and its contents out of hand and critics of the president to lift up individual statements as accurate to suggest that the overarching claim is as wellWe decided to evaluate the claims in the dossier as best we could to guide that debate Its certainly the case that we may have missed something if so The dossier is composed of 17 company intelligence reports each assigned a number between 80 and 135 and most of which include the date the report was completed although the numeric order doesnt always match the calendar orderNote that we cant verify that the reports actually from those dates This is important because the reports do sometimes make claims that were proven to be accurate by later reporting but we dont_know that they werent written after those reports and dated priorWe do know that in late October of last_year Mother Joness David Corn having seen the dossier and its contents BuzzFeed the version we reviewed in early January Any reports after that point were clearly after the factIts also worth noting that the information included in the reports is mostly unverified humint intelligence gathered by talking to people As Wired shortly_after the dossier was published such intelligence will usually be flagged with indicators suggesting how credible the sources and claims should be considered The dossier lacks thatWriting for the National Review David Satter that the dossier also seemed to comport with the idea of Russian actors deliberately sharing information meant to position Russia in a particular wayFor referenceWe will evaluate the claims in each report individually Its critical to note that these claims are for the most part verified and should not be considered as such Dated June 20 2016 Russian President_Vladimir Putin and the Russian_government had sought to cultivate Trump for a period of five_years (that is beginning in 2011) Report suggests that Trump was offered and declined real-estate deals and that the Russians have compromising_information on both Trump and Clinton Trumps relationship with Russian interests extends back during which time he may have been contacted by Russian agents In 2011 Trump was flirting with running for president including by attacking President_Barack Obamas nativity By 2013 hed partnered with a businessman named Aras_Agalarov to host the Miss_Universe pageant in Moscow It was Agalarov and his son Emin who were later the vehicle for orchestrating a meeting between a Kremlin-backed lawyer and Donald Trump Jr at Trump_Tower in June 2016Theres no_evidence at hand that this cultivation took_place however The dossier claims a carrot-and-stick approach to keeping Trump in line with the carrot being those real_estate deals and the stick being the salacious event Subsequent reporting though indicates that Trump_Organization lawyer Michael_Cohen (whose name will come up again) Putin aide Dmitry_Peskov (whose name also will come up again) in January 2016 to ask for help in advancing a project in the capital The deal collapsed undercutting the idea that six_months later Russia would have claimed to be trying to bolster Trumps efforts in the cityThe report also suggests that the compromising_information on Clinton was mostly in the form of recordings of comments made while traveling in Russia (This information is said to be controlled by Peskov per the report) By this time hackers believed to be tied to the Russian_government already had network and the email of Clinton campaign_chairman information that was discussed in later reports Neither is mentioned in this report from late June before either set of hacked documents was released via WikiLeaks Dated July 19 2016 Trump campaign aide Carter_Page met with thechief executive of fossil-fuel giant Rosneft Igor Sechin and Kremlin official Igor Diveykin who American officials was in charge of collecting intelligence about the campaign Diveykin again raised the compromising_material about Clinton with Page Page was in Moscow in early July a trip that was reported at the time He denied meeting Sechin or Diveykin This report suggests that Diveykin offered to release the compromising_information on Clinton to Trumps campaign team an offer that we now know was made before that June meeting in Trump_Tower as well Its not clear why Diveykin would make this offer after having already had the opportunity to release that information to Donald Trump Jr a month earlier Undated An ethnic Russian close associate of Trump says theres a conspiracy of cooperating between the campaign and Moscow The source says that Russia hacked the DNC and leaked the files to WikiLeaks to maintain plausible deniabilityTrumps team had repaid Russia by sidelining Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue and questioning NATOs commitments in the BalticsThe migr claimed a tripartite group of actors Firstly there were agents/facilitators within the Democratic_Party structure itself secondly Russian migr and associated offensive cyber operators based in the US and thirdly state-sponsored cyberoperatives working in Russia Diplomatic staff in several cities were using the migr pension distribution system as cover for communicating with RussiaThe report claimed that Trump had sought a real_estate deal in St_Petersburg as well and that the campaign was comfortable with attention being focused on Russia because it distracted the media from business_dealings in China and other emerging markets that included bribes and kickbacks Its not clear when this report was written but the contents and context suggest that it is from late JulyEmails from the DNC were published on WikiLeaks on July 22 but some files were published by Guccifer 20 in mid-June Before any files were released The Washington_Post had Russian actors as the likely culprits Its unlikely then that an outside observer wouldnt have known what the migr claimed about the hacksBy late July Trump had already NATOs role The_Post also had already on the Trump campaigns efforts to remove language from the party platform at the convention that would have bolstered Ukraine in its fight with RussiaThe overarching assertion in this report is the most_important one That Trumps team and Russian actors were colluding This too hasnt been proven and its not clear the extent to which the investigations of that collusion that we know exist were spurred by the dossier itselfIts hard to evaluate the other claims made above but its clear that Trump did seek business deal in St_Petersburg (perhaps including a reality show) There also has been reporting by the New_Yorker on projects in and that may have raised questions about possible bribery and corruption Dated July 26 2016 Russia has an extensive program aimed_at hacking foreign adversaries Some examples are provided that dont seem to be related to what_happened to 2016 That the Russians were actively hacking Westerners is clearly true and was well-known even before the electionAlthough its not clear how the DNC servers were accessed it doesnt_seem to have been through the means described in this report Podestas email was hacked using which isnt mentioned in this report Dated July 30 2016 The Russian_government was nervous about the attention paid to its role in leaking information specifically the DNC emailsThe report also claims that Trump and his associates had for at_least eight years been providing Russia with intelligence on the activities business and otherwise in the US of leading Russian oligarchs and their families Sourced to a Russian migr figure close to Trump the report claims that the Kremlin had more intelligence on Clinton but didnt know when it might be released This could be a reference to the Podesta emails that were released in OctoberWe also fall into what might be called the Nostradamus trap Retrofitting what we know now to what was written about beforehand The vagueness of more intelligence makes it hard to say this is a description of the Podesta hackIts also not clear how or if Trump did (or could have) provided Moscow with information on oligarchs Dated Aug 5 2016 Details internal dissension in Russia over blowback from the intervention efforts Sergei Ivanov Putins chief of staff is reported to be angry about the intervention efforts of Peskov and others This report is largely inconsequential for our purposes Dated Aug_10 2016 Similar to Report 100 this document mostly details internal dynamics It also asserts that no new leaks [were] envisaged as too politically risky but rather further exploitation of (WikiLeaks) material already disseminated to exacerbate divisions The goal of the existing leaks was to turn educated youth against Clinton and toward TrumpThe Kremlin was also reaching_out to other political figures funding trips to Moscow Those figures included Green Party candidate Jill Stein Michael T Flynn and Carter_Page Russia had already accessed Podestas email by this point according to US authorities so this report seems to be claiming that those emails would not be releasedOtherwise this information was already known Young voters were more skeptical of Clinton than others as evidenced by the already-concluded Democratic primary Flynn (an adviser to Trump) and Stein visited Moscow for RTs 10-year anniversary a visit that was Pages visit is discussed above Dated Aug_10 2016 This report focuses on the same ethnic Russian associate of Trumps and largely discusses what the campaign hoped to do (such as turning young voters against Clinton) This report is largely inconsequential for our purposes Dated Aug 22 2016 Former Ukrainian president Viktor_Yanukovych told Putin that hed paid Trump campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort under the table but that it was untraceable Report cites a Trump associate claiming that the revelation of those payments was part of why Manafort left the campaign (as he did shortly_before the reports publishing date) and part was pressure from former campaign_manager Corey_Lewandowski The role of the alleged payments was as a reason for Manaforts ouster The tension between him and Lewandowski was not unknown and neither was the fact that Lewandowski still spoke with Trump regularly Dated Sep 14 2016 The Russians have further compromising_material about Clinton described as emails that they are considering disseminating after the Russian legislative elections in late SeptemberChief of staff Ivanov was fired which the report suggests was because of the advice he gave Putin on the issue of election intervention The report says that a diplomat was also removed from the Washington embassy because of possible exposure from his role in the meddling The claim about the emails is significant offering one of the few indicators that Steele uncovered the existence of the Podesta hack before it became public (The emails were published in early October) The vagueness of the description of the material though might also be a reference to some other batch of informationIvanovs was reported as a power struggle Putin described it publicly as having been the natural conclusion of Ivanovs term of serviceThe question of the ousted diplomat is interesting Steele writes his name as Mikhail Kulagin In August Mikhail after six years in DC a move that doesnt appear to have been reported at the timeIt was widely reported that US intelligence officials had verified Steeles claim about Kalugin that he was an intelligence_officer Whether he was withdrawn for involvement in meddling though is not clear Dated Sep 14 2016 Deals with a business relationship involving Putin This report is largely inconsequential for our purposes Dated Sep 14 2016 Asserts that Trump paid bribes for possible business deals in St_Petersburg a claim that Agalarov could verify As mentioned above Trump did seek set in the city Other business_dealings are unclear Dated Oct 12 2016 Russia had injected further anti-Clinton material into the plausibly deniable leaks pipeline that would keep emerging Putin was angry about how the operation was progressing though his administration had assumed direct control to the extent that Foreign_Minister Sergey Lavrovs job might be at risk By Oct 12 the Podesta emails were dripping out WikiLeaks the pipeline apparently used for the DNC hacks as well was regularly and would continue to do so That a number of releases had already occurred would be known to most outside observersThe report indicates that the effort to intervene on behalf of Trump originated with Lavrovs department and eventually made its way to Putins team directly This comports with about Putin having a direct hand in the effort That said Lavrov still holds his position Dated Oct 18 2016 One of the more significant reports it again asserts that Page met with Rosneft chief_executive Sechin in July At the meeting Sechin offered Page and Trump a 19 percent stake in Rosneft in exchange for lifting sanctions on Russia if electedIt also asserts that Cohen Trumps lawyer was playing a key role in the Russia-Trump relationship The Rosneft claim received a lot of attention when in January a 195 percent stake in the company was sold to Later reporting though indicated that the buyers were It was essentially a loan and Moscow prearranged to buy back some of the company from the QatarisThat said Trump did seek to quickly on Russia imposed after the country seized Crimea in 2014More on Cohen below Dated Oct 19 2016 The report claims that Cohen played an important role liaising between Trumps team and Moscow including meeting with Russian agents to cover up Manaforts involvement in Ukraine and Pages interactions with the Russians More below Dated Oct 20 2016 Claims that Cohen traveled to Prague at some point in August to coordinate the relationship There he met with Russian agents at an agency that distributes foreign aid Cohen has repeatedly any such meeting saying that his one trip to Europe in 2016 was a July trip to Italy backed up by He also says that he was in California for the last_week of August with his sonThere has been no_evidence presented to place Cohen in Prague Dated Dec 13 2016 Cohens trip to Prague included three colleagues and centered on how to clean up the evidence of collusion including determining how to make final payments from both Russia and Trump to hackersThe report also outlined that an unidentified company and its affiliates had been using botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses plant bugs steal data and conduct altering operations against the Democratic party leadership If Clinton won the presidency the plan was to pay off the Romanian hackers and have other participants head to Bulgaria to lay low Again theres no_evidence Cohen was in Prague This report claims that he was there during that last_week in August or early September USC confirmed Cohens visit during that first period to While its not clear how the DNC server was accessed we do know that the Podesta emails were obtained through a phishing attempt not by leveraging botnets porn or bugsThe Steele dossier makes a wide range of claims many of which are rumors that couldnt be independently verified Many other claims involve things that would have been publicly known at the time the report was apparently drafted Although its impossible to say that the dossier is entirely inaccurate (there are some glimmers of accurate predictions) it is also impossible to say that it has been broadly validatedThat unsatisfying answer has a side effect It gives either side of the political fight all the ammo that it might wantGeorge Washington wanted a little adviceIt was 1789 he had just become the president of the newly minted United_States of America and he was about to issue the nations first executive_order except it was more of an executive he asked the heads of various federal departmentsto impress me with a full precise and distinct general idea of the affairs of the United StatesThere were a lot of affairs Washington was trying to grow almost from scratch a centralized federal government in a nation full of people who had just rebelled against a central authorityThe first president needed to decide whether to tax wealthy businessmen who had helped fund the American Revolution or a growing middle class looking for an economic foothold England and France were headed toward warWashington wanted his advisers to help him get a handle on the country he was leading before they started making policyIt will be much easier to commence the administration upon a well-adjusted system built on tenable grounds than to correct errors or alter inconveniences after they shall have been confirmed by habit he wrote to Vice_President John Adams a month earlier Now 228 years later historians wonder whether President Trump could take a history lesson from Washingtons first executive_order (Such actionswerent officially called executive_orders until Abraham Lincolns presidency according to Kenneth R Mayer a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin at Madison But the concept was essentially the same)Trump has signed more_than 10 executive_orders during his first few_weeks in office that are intended to crack down on crime and violence in AmericaThere have also been executive_orders to address health_care ethics financial regulations and infrastructureSigning orders to move_forward with the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines in the Oval_Office Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Some of Trumps executive_orders and actions have of course been more controversial than othersA week into his term Trump signed which from seven majority-Muslim nationsDays later the acting_attorney general questioned the legality of the order and told Justice_Department lawyers not to defend it The legality of the ban has been debated in federal court On Thursdayin a unanimous that triggered an angry response from a president of lateSEE YOU IN COURT THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Earlier a froze federal hiring But shortly afterward the freeze was criticized because it disproportionately hurt veterans who receive preference in federal jobsTrumps executive actions have come at a rapid clip which is to be expected said Mayerthe political science professorA new president works quickly to assert his authority_over the federal government Mayer said in an_interview What is unusual is the scope of what Trump has tried to do and frankly the casualness with which these orders have come outThey were not properly vettedOne of the reasons the immigration order was struck down Mayer said is because it was so sloppily executedIn some cases federal agencies charged with enforcing the new administrations executive_orders say they were blindsidedThe departments of homeland_security and state seem to be learning about things after the fact said Cristina Rodrguez a constitutional law professor at Yale I dont_think weve_seen anything like this before Its a disregard for reality the desire to bypass agencies altogether Government fact-finding has grown more complex as the executive_branch has expanded Rodrguez told The PostWhen Washington assumed the presidency he didnt have senior advisers a modern president wouldnt need an executive_order to find out details of a policy proposalStill its uncommon for a president not to vet executive_orders with the agencies that would have to carry them out she saidIts necessary in a different way now because society is much more complex and government has a much broader reach Rodrguez said You probably need greater expertise and people have been specialized in a way that they may not have had in [Washingtons] timeAs The Fixs Basically an executive_order is an official statement from the president about how the federal agencies he oversees are touse their resourcesIt falls under the broader umbrella of executive actionswhich derive their power fromArticle II of the Constitution and it is the most formal executive action Executive actions also include presidential memorandums (which are a step below executive_orders and basically outline the administrations position on a policy issue) proclamations and directivesAn executive orderis not the president creating new law or appropriating new money from the US Treasury both things that are the domain of Congress it is the president instructing the government how it is to work within the parameters that are already set by Congress and the ConstitutionTrumps for example basically establishes building the wall as a federal priority and directs the Department of Homeland_Security to use already-available funding to get the ball rolling on its constructionThe presidents executive_orders are recorded in the Federal Register and are considered binding but they are subject to legal reviewIn his explainer Blake noted that executive_orders have often been the subject of controversy with the opposition party accusing the president of overstepping his authority and acting like a dictator Basically theyre arguing that hes the law rather_than working within itPresidents can blunt some of that criticism by consulting which has benefitsbeyond merely getting things right according to a historian who has written extensively about American life after the Revolutionary WarThe conversations before the orders show that the executive_branch is listening to the people paid to advise the president and to the people he represents That desire dates back to the years before the RevolutionAmericans had a paranoid fear of a dictator that was the terrifying fear that lurked in every Americans heart Fleming told The_Post Washington was aware of that and thats something Trump needs to learnHes much too in love with these executive_orders and acting solo without any advice Thats the way you show the people that the government is acting in the best interest of the people that its actually representing themSpecial counsel_Robert S_Mueller III on Monday former Trump campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort and his longtime business_partner Rick_Gates as well as charges_against former Trump foreign_policy adviser George_Papadopoulos who pleaded_guilty earlier_this monthThe developments stem from asweeping investigation Muelleris conducting into possible collusion_between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence US politicsPapadopoulos a Trump campaign volunteer made false_statements to FBI officials earlier_this year when asked about contacts he had with a foreign professor according to the The contact claimed to have high-level Russian connections that could provide dirt on then-candidate Hillary_Clinton in the form of thousands of emails and arrange a meeting between Trump campaign officials and Russian leaders all the way up to President_Vladimir PutinMany of the which include money_laundering and tax fraud relate to alleged crimes that predate either of the political operatives joiningthe Trump campaignThey primarily involve the concealment of millions of dollars they made while working on behalf of apro-Putin political party in UkraineAccording to the indictment the duo also obscured the fact that they were working for a foreign government anddid not register under the Foreign_Agents Registration_Act as required by law Manafort and Gates both pleaded not guilty on Monday Who are the Ukrainians and Russians for whom Manaforts firm worked And what impact might scrutiny of those connections have on Muellers wider probe That story in condensed form below starts in 2005After gaining prominence working as a political consultant in Washington for major figures including presidents Gerald Ford Ronald_Reagan and George_HW Bush Manaforts star faded and hefound work for authoritarian leaders in the Philippines Zaire and elsewhere In 2005 Manafort was hired by a Ukrainian steel magnate who wanted to burnish his international imageAkhmetovs company was based in a heavily industrialized mostly Russian-speaking part of eastern Ukraine He was one of a large group of Ukrainian oligarchs with close ties to the leader of the Russia-friendly Party of Regions Manafort was hired by the political party soon thereafterManafort provided image consulting to Yanukovych and members of his party during the parliamentary elections of 2006 and 2007 seeking to soften the edges of politicians from the rough industrial cities in Ukraines southeast wrote my colleagues at The Washington_Post last August when Ukrainian showing $127millionin apparent payments to Manafort between 2007 and 2012 by Yanukovychs partyHe got Yanukovych to comb his hair better to stay on message during public appearances and to adopt the kind of sharp rhetoric that had worked so well for Manaforts mentor Republican strategist Lee Atwater they wrote He drilled them on talking_points and told them what suits to wearYanukovych was successfully elected president in 2010 In those early years in Eastern Europe Manafort also worked on projects with a who was then one of the worlds richest men Despite rocky patches in their business relationship Manafort Deripaska weekly briefings on the 2016 US presidential_election while_serving as Trumps campaign_chairman Manaforts firm did_not just work with Yanukovych on domestic politics Its lobbying on Yanukovychs behalf in Western capitals is why the lack of Foreign_Agents Registration_Act compliance is mentioned in Muellers indictmentIn Washington Manafort worked to promote Yanukovych as a pro-Western democrat But in 2014 Yanukovych was deposed by a popular uprising fueled by anger at his alleged corruption authoritarianism and preference for Putin over the European_Union Yanukovych fled to Russia and is wanted in Ukraine on charges of high treasonThe Post has that Ukrainian business records_show that Manaforts firm did_not close his business operations in the country until April_2016 the month after he joined the Trump campaign (though two months before he become its chairman)Manaforts connections in the region and their tendency to align with pro-Russian interests made his appointment as Trumps campaign_chairman all the more controversial Reporting on the nature of those tiesbecame clearer just as Trump was beginning to make more and more pro-Russian comments on the campaign_trail Democratic opponents became vocal about collusion allegations between Trumps campaign and the Kremlin Manaforts position became increasingly untenableand he was asked to resign in August 2016Former campaign adviser has been thrust into a national spotlight after he pleaded_guilty tolying to federal investigators amid a probe into possible Russian influence in US political affairsPapadopoulos pleaded_guilty this month to lying about his involvement with people he understood had connections to the Russian governmentAs The Washington Postscourt documents released Monday show that Papadopoulos met withan unnamed overseas professor in Italy in March_2016 That same month he was nameda foreign_policy adviser to the Trump campaign According to the court_documents Papadopoulos also reported back to campaign officials about his attempts to set_up meetings between the campaign and the Russian governmentSo who is George_Papadopoulos the man an excellent guy The proposal sent a ripple of concern through campaign headquarters in Trump_Tower Campaign co-chairman Sam_Clovis wrote that he thought NATO_allies should be consulted before any plans were made Another Trump adviser retired Navy Rear Adm Charles Kubic cited legal concerns including a possible violation of US sanctions against Russia and of the Logan Act which prohibits US citizens from unauthorized negotiation with foreign governmentsBut Papadopoulos a campaign volunteer with scant foreign_policy experience persisted Between March and September [2016] the self-described energy consultant sent at_least a half-dozen requests for Trump as he turned from primary candidate to party nominee or for members of his team to meet with Russian officials Among those to express concern about the effort was then-campaign chairman_Paul Manafort who rejected in May 2016 a proposal from Papadopoulos for Trump to do soWhite House_press secretary_Sarah HuckabeeSanders said Monday that Papadopouloss guilty plea has nothing to do with his campaign activities only his failure to be honest about themIt was extremely limitedSanders told_reporters during a news briefing aboutPapadopouloss role in the campaign It was a volunteer positionIn June a Belarusan American businessman who goes by the name Sergei Millian shared some tantalizing claims about Donald TrumpTrump had a long-standing relationship with Russian officials Millian told an associate and those officials were now feeding Trump damaging_information about his Democratic_opponent Hillary_Clinton Millian said that the information provided to Trump had been very helpfulUnbeknownst to Millian however his conversation was not confidential His associate passed on what he had heard to a former_British intelligence_officer who had been hired by Trumps political opponents to gather information about the Republicans ties to RussiaThe allegations by Millian whose role was first reported by the Wall_Street Journal and has been confirmed by The Washington_Post were central to the dossier compiled by the former spy Christopher_Steele While the dossier has not been verified and its claims have been denied by Trump Steeles document said that Millians assertions had been corroborated by other sources including in the Russian_government and former intelligence sourcesThe most explosive allegation that the dossier says originally came from Millian is the claim that Trump had hired prostitutes at the Moscow Ritz-Carlton and that the Kremlin has kept evidence of the encounterBy his own evolving statements Sergei Millian is either a shrewd businessman with high-level access to both Trumps inner_circle and the Kremlin or a bystander unwittingly caught up in a global controversyAn examination of Millians career shows he is a little of both His case lays bare the challenge facing the FBI as it investigates Russias alleged attempts to manipulate the American political system and whether Trump associates participatedIt also illustrates why the Trump administration remains unable to shake the Russia story While some of the unproven claims attributed in the dossier to Millian are bizarre and outlandish there are also indications that he had contacts with Trumps circleMillian told several people that during the campaign and presidential transition he was in touch with George_Papadopoulos a campaign foreign_policy adviser according to a person_familiar with the matter Millian is among Papadopouloss nearly 240 Facebook friends Trump aides vehemently reject Millians claims to have had close contact with Trump or high-level access to the presidents company Millian did_not answer a list of detailed questions about his interactions with Trump and his role in the Steele dossier instead responding by email with lengthy general defenses of Trumps election as Gods will and complaining that inquiries about his role are evidence of a witch_hunt and McCarthyismAny falsifications deceit and baseless allegations directed against any US President is damaging to the national_security interests of the United_States he wrote in one email Publishing slanderous stories about the Presidents decency and offensive material about the first family is malicious propaganda and a threat to the national_security in order to destabilize the integrity of the United_States of America and stir civil disorder aiming at reducing its political influence in the worldIn late January Millian appeared on Russian television where he denied knowing information that could be damaging to Trump I want to say that I dont have any compromising_information neither in Russia nor in the United_States nor could I have he said speaking in Russian Without a doubt it is a blatant lie and an effort of some people its definitely a group of people to portray our president in a bad light using my nameThe dossier decried by Trump as phony stuff and fake_news and derided by Russian President_Vladimir Putin as rubbish consists of a series of reports compiled by Steele over the course of several months before the electionMillian identified in different portions of the dossier as Source D and Source E is described as a close associate of TrumpIn addition to the salacious allegations that gained widespread attention the dossier attributed other claims to Millian For_instance Steele wrote that Millian asserted that there was a well developed conspiracy of cooperation between [Trump] and Russian leadership claiming the relationship was managed for Trump by former campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort A Manafort spokesman said every word in the dossier about Paul_Manafort is a lieSome of those who know Millian described him as more of a big-talking schmoozer than a globe-trotting interlocutor They say hes a self-promoter with a knack for getting himself on television like the time he appeared on a 2013 episode of the Bravo reality show Million Dollar Listing where he attempted to broker a sale with a Russian-speaking client who agreed to pay $7million in cash for a luxury New_York unitHes an opportunist If he sees an opportunity he would go after it said Tatiana Osipova who was a neighbor of Millians when he lived in Atlanta and who in 2006 helped him found a trade group the Russian American_Chamber of Commerce in the USA Osipova now lives in St_Petersburg but has remained in touch with Millian Hes a fun guy a smart guy But always talking He talks so much s---Millians original name was Siarhei Kukuts but those who know him say he changed it because he wanted something that sounded more elegant He told ABC News in July that he changed his name to honor his grandmother whose last name he said was Millianovich He has also at times gone by the name Sergio MillianMy general impression of him was that he just wanted to be important Nobody really knew what he or the chamber were doing but he presented himself with grandeur said Nadia Diskavets a New_York photographer who was also a founding member of the Russian American_Chamber of Commerce but has not been in touch with Millian recently So I always took everything he said with a grain of saltAnother acquaintance referred to him in a similar way saying he exaggerated his connections with Trump and with the Russians Hes too small of a fish to deal with Russian people she said They will smell his smallness from miles awayBorn in Belarus Millian 38 attended a university in Minsk A Russian-language version of his biography that was posted on the Russian American_Chamber of Commerces website says he studied to be a military translatorHe arrived in the early 2000s as a young single professional in Atlanta which has a large Russian-speaking community Friends there said he worked in real_estate and according to one rsum posted online he opened a translating business whose clients included the Russian Ministry of Foreign AffairsFriends said that Millian founded the Russian American_Chamber of Commerce as a way to forge business ties_between the United_States and Russia and as a personal networking opportunityMillians affiliation with the group also appears to have boosted his profile in Russia He hosted events in the United_States and abroad on the chambers behalf and after moving to New_York began being interviewed repeatedly by Russian-language news_outlets as an expert on US-Russia relations He traveled to Moscow in 2011 courtesy of a Russian_government cultural group later investigated by the FBI for allegedly recruiting spies though there is no_evidence that the inquiry involved Millian Millians account of his relationship with Trump has shifted over time As the Republican candidate was rising in the spring of 2016 a time before there was close scrutiny of Trumps ties to Russia Millian used his media appearances to describe deep connections with the New_York real_estate mogulHe told the Russian state-operated news_agency RIA Novosti last April for instance that he met Trump at a Miami horse-racing track after mutual associates had organized a trip for Trump to Moscow in 2007From there Millian said he entered into a business arrangement in which he says he helped market a Trump-branded condominium complex in Hollywood Fla to international investors including RussiansMillians description of the Miami event appears to match up with a picture he posted on Facebook that appears to show him posing with Trump and the projects developer Jorge Prez the only evidence that Millian ever met TrumpA spokesman for Prez said his company has no record of paying Millian in connection with the project and Prez declined to comment furtherA White_House spokeswoman said Sergei Millian is one of hundreds of thousands of people the president has had his picture made with but they do not know one anotherMillian however promoted ties he claimed to hold with Trumps companyA 2009 newsletter posted to the website of the Russian American_Chamber of Commerce reported that the group had signed formal agreements with the Trump_Organization and Prezs company to jointly service the Russian clients commercial residential and industrial real_estate needsIn the interview with RIA Novosti Millian boasted that when he was in New_York Trump introduced him to his right-hand man Michael_Cohen a longtime Trump adviser a claim that Cohen has deniedHe is the chief attorney of Trump through whom all contracts have to go Millian told the Russian news outlet adding I was involved in the signing of a contract to promote Trumps real_estate projects in RussiaYou can say that I was their exclusive broker Millian continued in Russian Back then in 2007-2008 Russians by the dozens were buying apartments in Trumpsbuildings in the USAAsked in the April interview how often he spoke to Trump or his associates Millian responded The last time was several days agoMillian told people last_year that he was in touch with Papadopoulos whom Trump had described in a March_2016 Washington_Post editorial board interview as a member of his foreign_policy team and an excellent guy Papadopoulos received attention during the campaign largely because of reports that he had exaggerated his rsum and cited among his accomplishments that he had participated in a Model United_Nations program for college and graduate studentsBut according to foreign news reports and officials he conducted a number of high-level meetings last_year and presented himself as a representative of the Trump campaign He told a group of researchers in Israel that Trump saw Putin as a responsible actor and potential partner according to a column in the Jerusalem Post while later he met with a British Foreign Office representative in London an embassy spokesman said He also criticized US sanctions on Russia in an_interview with the Russian news outlet InterfaxPapadopoulos did_not respond to questions about contacts with Millian But Papadopoulos said by email that his public comments during the campaign reflected his own opinions and that some of his energy policy views run counter to Russian interests No one from the campaign ever directed me to discuss talking_points he said In a separate email he accused The_Post of relying on innuendo and unsubstantiated claims by irrelevant sourcesNeither Millian nor a White_House spokeswoman responded to questions about Papadopoulos The person_familiar with the contacts who spoke on the condition of anonymity did_not provide details Over the summer as Trump prepared to accept the Republican presidential nomination Millian traveled to Russia He posted pictures on his Facebook page showing that he attended a Russian government-sponsored summit in St_Petersburg in June One photograph shows him with Russias minister for energy Another shows him chatting with Russian aluminum_magnate Oleg_Deripaska who is close to Putin A spokeswoman for Deripaska declined to comment A spokesman for the Russian Embassy did_not respond to questions about MillianLater in the summer Millian continued boasting of his Trump connectionsHe told ABC News that he had been the official broker for the Trump-branded condo building and described Trumps affinity for working with Russians He pointed to hundreds of millions of dollars that [Trump] received from interactions with Russian businessmenMillian added that Trump likes Russia because he likes beautiful Russian ladies talking to them of course And he likes to be able to make lots of money with RussiansMillian told ABC that he was absolutely not involved with Russian intelligence But when asked whether he had heard rumors to that effect Millian replied Yes of courseMillian also said that at times he talked about US politics with top Russian officials Usually if I meet top people in the Russian_government they invite me say to the Kremlin for the reception of course I have a chance to talk to some presidential advisers and some top people Millian saidWhile Cohen has said he has never_met Millian the two did interact last_year over Twitter Millian was for a time one of about 100 people that Cohen followed and they tweeted at each_other on one occasion in August after Cohen appeared on televisionCohen later unfollowed Millian telling The_Post that he had mistakenly thought Millian was related to a Trump_Organization employee with a similar last nameHe is a total phony Cohen said in an_interview Anything coming out of this individuals mouth is inaccurate and purely part of some deranged interest in having his name in the newspaperCohen said he did_not believe Trump was in Russia in 2007 as Millian claimed in AprilCohen said it was possible that like other brokers in Florida Millian might have attempted to sell units at Trump Hollywood But he said Millian never held an exclusive deal at the project or any contract with the Trump OrganizationSpeaking with The_Post over the phone from his New_York office in a January interview Cohen also read aloud from a lengthy email he said Millian had sent him shortly_before the election that contradicted his earlier public statementsI met Mr Trump once long time ago in 2008 pretty much for a photo opportunity and a brief talk as part of my marketing work for Trump Hollywood after my brokering service was signed Now to say that I have substantial ties is total nonsense Cohen said reading from an email he said Millian wrote after media coverage that mentioned himIn the email Millian suggested holding a news_conference to clear up the matter Cohen said Cohen said he rejected the idea accusing Millian via email of seeking media attention off of this false narrative of a Trump-Russia alliance despite having met Trump only one time for a 10 second photo opCohen who left his job at the Trump_Organization in January to become Trumps personal attorney said this month that he could not release a copy of Millians email because he no_longer has access to the companys email systemIn South Florida where Millian claimed to have had a contract to sell units at Trump Hollywood there is little evidence that he played a major roleDaniel Lebensohn whose company BH3 took over for the Related Group in 2010 after Prezs company struggled to complete the project said his companys records_show no sign that Millian sold any units in the buildingTwo Florida-based real_estate brokers who specialize in the Russian market and have sold units in Trump Hollywood were equally mystifiedIve never heard of him said Olga Mirer who has traveled back and forth to Russia over the past decade brokering deals at Trump Hollywood and other Florida buildingsDespite the Trump teams efforts to distance the president from Millian the dossier source nevertheless attended Trumps inauguration in JanuaryHe posted photos of himself on Facebook attending VIP events for supporters including one in which he posed in front of the podium at a reception for Trump chief of staff_Reince Priebus at Trumps Washington hotel A White_House official did_not address a question about Millians attendance Alice_Crites in Washington and David_Filipov in Moscow contributed to this reportNewly released court_documents show that Trump foreign_policy adviser George_Papadopoulos communicated with several senior campaign officials about his outreach to the Russian_government over a period of months The recipients of Papadopouloss emails are not named in the filings but The Washington_Post has identified several individuals based on interviews and other documents Papadopoulos this month to lying to federal agents about his outreach to Russia Victoria Toensing an attorney for Sam_Clovis confirmed that several references in court_filings to the campaign supervisor refer to the onetime radio_host from Iowa who served as Trumps national campaign co-chairmanAt one point Papadopoulos_emailed Clovis and other campaign officials about a March 24 2016 meeting he had in London with a professor who had introduced him to the Russian_ambassador and a Russian woman he described as Putins_niece The group had talked about arranging a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss US-Russia ties under President Trump Papadopoulos wrote (Papadopoulos later learned that the woman was not Putins_niece and while he expected to meet the ambassador he never did according to filings)Clovis responded that he would work it through the campaign adding great work according to court documentsIn August 2016 Clovis responded to efforts by Papadopoulos to organize an off the record meeting with Russian officials I would encourage you and another foreign_policy adviser to the campaign to make the trip if it is feasible Clovis wroteToensing said Clovis always vigorously opposed any Russian trip for Donald Trump and/or the campaign She said his responses to Papadopoulos were courtesy by a polite gentleman from Iowa Emails previously described to The_Post indicate that the high-ranking campaign official described in court_documents is onetime campaign_manager Corey_Lewandowski The emails were among more_than 20000 pages that the Trump campaign turned over to congressional_committees after review by White_House and defense lawyersLewandowski who was pushed out of his post in June_2016 did_not respond to requests for commentPapadopoulos wrote to Lewandowski several_times to let him know that the Russians were interested in forging a relationship with the campaign court_filings showIn one email on April 27 2016 Papadopoulos wrote to discuss Russias interest in hosting Mr TrumpHave been receiving a lot of calls over the last_month about Putin wanting to host him and the team when the time is right he addedIn May Papadopoulos forwarded to Lewandowski an offer of cooperation from a Russian with links to the Ministry of Foreign_Affairs Is this something we want to move_forward with he askedThere is no_indication if or how Lewandowski responded to those messages But in June when Papadopoulos_emailed him again about Russia Lewandowski referred him to Clovis because he is running point according to court_documents The court_filings indicate that Papadopoulos_emailed another high-ranking campaign official on May 21 2016 with the subject line Request from Russia to meet Mr TrumpThe Post has previously identified this official as Paul_Manafort who was indicted Monday on unrelated criminal chargesManafort forwarded Papadopouloss email to another campaign official stating We_need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips referring to a trip to Russia It should be someone low_level in the campaign so as not to send any signalManafort spokesman_Jason Maloni in Augustthat the campaign chairmans response indicated that any invitation by Russia directly or indirectly would be rejected outright The_Post has previously identified the official who received the May 21 2016 email from Manafort as his deputy_Rick Gates Gates was indicted Monday on unrelated criminal_charges The court_filings indicate that on April 27 2016 Papadopoulos_emailed a senior policy advisor and wrote Have some interesting messages coming in from Moscow about a trip when the time is rightThe Post has not identified this official Court filings indicate that Clovis told Papadopoulos that he would encourage him and another foreign_policy adviser to the campaign to make a trip to meet with Russian officials if is feasible Emails previously reviewed by the Post show that the other person to whom Clovis was referring was Trump foreign_policy adviser Walid Phares who has worked as a Fox_News commentatorRebecca Bynum a spokeswoman for Phares said Phares had met Papadopoulos only once at a March 31 2016 meeting of Trumps national_security advisers a group that included both men She said Phares never traveled with Papadopoulos did_not have any conversations with him about making such trips and had been unaware until this week that Clovis had mentioned his name I_think Clovis was just trying to get [Papadopoulos] out of his hair she said According to emails previously described to The_Post the London-based professor who was a key contact for Papadopoulos in his Russian outreach is who formerly served as a government official in MaltaMifsud did_not respond to a request for comment Monday In an email to The_Post in August he wrote that he had absolutely no contact with the Russian_government and said his only ties to Russia were through academic linksPapadopoulos met Mifsud in March_2016 while traveling in Italy according to court_records The professor seemed uninterested in Papadopoulos until he learned that he was a campaign adviser according to court filingsFive days after Trump named Papadopoulos as one of his advisers during a meeting at The_Post Papadopoulos and Mifsud met in London The professor brought with him a Russian woman who was introduced as a relative of President_Vladimir Putin who had connections to senior Russian_government officialsThe following month Mifsud told Papadopoulos that he had just returned from Moscow where he had learned from high-level Russian_government officials that Russia had dirt on Democratic presidential_candidate Hillary_Clinton including thousands of emails Court documents_show that Papadopoulos corresponded with a female Russian national whom he initially believed was Putins nieceAt one point she wrote to him The Russian Federation would love to welcome [Trump] once his candidature would be officially announcedThe Post has not identified the woman In April_2016 Mifsud introduced Papadopoulos over email to a man in Moscow who told Papadopoulos that he had connections to the Russian Ministry of Foreign_Affairs court_records showEmails previously described to The_Post indicate that the man is Ivan Timofeev a program director at a Russian government-funded think_tank called the Russian International_Affairs CouncilPapadopoulos communicated via Skype and email with Timofeev to discuss establishing ties_between Russian officials and the Trump campaignOn Monday Timofeev declined to comment referring a reporter to a statement the Russian International_Affairs Council posted in August in response to a Post story The statement said that Papadopoulos had contacted the council and put forth the idea of a possible visit to Russia by Mr Trump or his team membersGiven the RIACs established practice of hosting public meetings with prominent politicians and public figures from the US and other countries the US initiative was a matter of routine for the Council the statement said pointing out that among the councils guest speakers was former US ambassador Michael McFaulTimofeev told The_Post in August that the idea of a meeting with Trump officials was dropped after he received no official request from the Trump campaign for a meeting David_Filipov in Moscow Karla_Adam in London and Tom_Hamburger and Robert Costa in Washington contributed to this reportGiven how angry Beijing gets about THAAD you may be forgiven for thinking that the US missile system deployed to South_Korea is primarily aimed_at China However Washington and Seoul have justified the system by saying it is necessary to defend South_Korea from North_Korean aggressionWith the missile system finally being deployed and tensions between the Koreas and China exploding again heres a guide to the controversyThe acronym stands forTerminal High_Altitude Area_Defense The ground-based missile_defense system which first came into development after the Persian Gulf War is designed to shoot down short- medium- and intermediate-range ballistic_missiles during the terminal phase (ie when they are coming down)According to the US company that manufacturers the system there are four stages to its operation First a radar system identifies the incoming threat then the target is identified and engaged An interceptor is fired from a truck-mounted launcher which destroysthe missile using kinetic energy Because the incoming missile is destroyed at a high altitude the effects of weapons of mass destruction can be mitigated with the deviceThe system is designed to be highly mobile and it consists of four main components atruck-mounted launcher eight interceptors on the launcher a transportable radar system and a fire control system that links the various components with external command centersTHAAD systems have been deployedin a number of places around the world including Guam and Hawaii However last_year the Defense_Department announced it would deploy a system to where it would be operated by US forces stationed in the country In a statement the Pentagon described the move as a defensive measure against North_Korea after the country continued to pursue nuclear_weapons and tested a number of ballistic_missile systemsThis week the situation on the Korean_Peninsula escalated dramatically On Tuesday North_Korean that the country has practiced attempts to hit US military bases in Japan with a number of recently launched missiles The number of missiles fired suggested that North_Korea was training to see how quickly it could set_up its extended-range missiles in a wartime settingThat same_day the United_States announced that it has begun deploying THAAD to While the land where the system is due to be deployed is not ready yet the equipment will be kept at a US air base in Osan until the site is prepared Full deployment is expected as early as JuneThe news of the THAAD_deployment sparked a threat of consequences from China I want to emphasize that we firmly oppose the deployment of THAAD said Geng_Shuang a spokesman for Chinas Foreign_Ministry at a on Tuesday We will resolutely take necessary measures to defend our security interestsOn the surface of it it may be hard to understand Beijings fury with THAAD For one thing its a purely defensive system THAAD systems dont carry warheads relying onthe force of the interceptor to destroy the incoming missile rather_than a detonation And while in theory the system could be used to intercept Chinese ballistic_missiles it would only work on missiles in their terminal phase ruling out those targeting the United_States which would still beascendingMoreover while China is well-known as a key ally and big brother of North_Korea it has shown itself to be exasperated by Pyongyangs recent missile_launches Beijing recently striking a major blow to the isolated nations economyInstead many experts argue that Chinas anger over THAAD has less to do with the missiles than with the sophisticated radar capabilities included in the system These radars couldbe used to track Chinas own missile systems potentially giving the United Statesa major advantage in any future conflict with China Some Chinese analysts argue that THAAD itself is of only limited use against North_Korea anyway as it would not be able to take out short-range missiles and artillery that do not reach high altitudes hinting that the radar may be the real reason for the deploymentMore broadly Beijing is concerned that the United_States is hoping to use both South_Korea and Japan to contain China in the future If South_Korea insists on becoming a US puppet China will have to act against it the nationalist state newspaper Global_Times wrote in an Chinesereaction appears to be moving to hurt South_Korea economically Beijing has already on Korean businesses that operate in China including shutting down stores of Lotte a South_Korean conglomerate that offered a golf course as land for THAAD useMore measures are expected Chinese travel agencies are stopping the sale of tickets to South_Korea and there have been growing calls in China to boycott South_Korean products and even cancel tours by K-pop stars Such moves carry significant weightSouth Korea has grown increasingly dependent economically on China in recent_years Chinais South_Koreas largest trading partner and the to the country were $142 billion in 2014 more_than twice the value of its exports to the United StatesChinese pressure also comes at a time of political transition in South_Korea Scandal has sidelined PresidentPark Geun-hye who is expected to find out this week whether she will be impeached And Moon Jae-in the leading liberal candidate to replace her has suggested he may reconsider the THAAD deploymentDuring last years presidential campaign Donald Trump spoke frequently of the threat posed by North_Korea and suggested he may lean on China which he said had total control over North_Korea However since taking office in January the new US president has been uncharacteristically mute on the subject despite provocations from Pyongyang This has left many North Korea-watchers wondering what exactly his eventual policy will beThe deployment of THAAD seems to be one of the first real moves against North_Korea though it was largely a continuation of policies undertaken by President_Barack Obama The backlash from China and various dramatic moves by North_Korea however show that the situation is complicatedA mere 14 inches of snow has fallen the entire winter in Washington If everything comes together just right we could increase that total by many multiples Monday_night But the further south and east you go in the region the less certain significant snow becomesModel forecasts on Saturday evening generally suggested very significant snow will fall Monday_night in the metro region away from Southern Maryland and could even reach double digits However nagging questions about how heavy the precipitation will be and where the rain-snow_line will set_up remainBased on the latest information we think a general 5-10 inches seems like a reasonable first call for snowfall amounts in the immediate_metro with more to the north and northeast and less to the south and southeastBelow find the stream of updates from our evening live blog session which informed this snowfall forecast Looking at all of the models (granted the European is still to come out) I am impressed with what the GFS Canadian and UKMet models are collectively conveying A classic snowstorm for the DC area with a strong area of low pressure developing near Cape Hatteras and tracking to a position off the Delmarva Tuesday morning The models all agree the storm will pass through relatively quickly but also produce heavy snow I_think some of the precipitation amounts they are simulating are probably overdone but even cutting them by 25-50 percent would still produce substantial snowfallThe NAM_model with its razor sharp rain-snow_line cutting through the immediate_metro area is a concern But I am mostly discounting it as it is not supported by the other models and also is not particularly good with forecasts beyond 36 hours Having said that especially as its March we need to pay close attention to temperatures because if the other models are too cold and temperatures dont fall as forecast with the snow amounts will fall well short of their potentialA reasonable first forecast is for about 5-10 inches of snow in the immediate_metro area and lesser amounts to the south and southeast and greater amounts to the north and northeastSee our first accumulation map which could well need altering Sunday just above this updateConsider that small changes in the forecast track on Sunday would mean major changes to these numbersWell have a fresh forecast up at 6 am Sunday and then a detailed storm update out before noon after reviewing the next big set of model forecastsRemember to adjust your clocks forward to tonight Thanks for joining us Im about to wrap things up for the night but have one more update in which Ill try to synthesize what Ive seen this evening Look for it in about 20 minutes The UKMet model is in which while lesser known is actually the second best-performer behind the famed European model We dont have great maps for this model but the simulation we see looks more or less consistent with the GFS and Canadian in terms of the storm track which is a favorable one for significant snow in Washington At 8 am Tuesday the storm is centered off the Delmarva Coast and the model shows heavy precipitation having fallen see image below The Canadian model snowfall totals from DC to Boston are obscene in the 15-20 inch range and I_think probably overdone at_least in our region For one I dont_think the storm will intensify fast enough to deliver that amount of snow in Washington in under 12 hours Secondly that amount of snow has no historic precedent at this time of year Third it is generally the worst performing model Finally not all of the snow it simulates will stickHaving said all of that it does have some support from the GFS model which to me means you at_least have to consider the possibility of double digits totals in our area Belowa visualization of the storm from the Canadian model Its eerily similar to the GFS Snow begins just before 8 pm Monday in the metro region quickly becomes and heavy and pastes the region overnight It does_not mix with rain or sleet in this model and is a classic track for heavy snow from Cape Hatteras to a position east of the Delmarva The storm then exits quickly Tuesday morning The Canadian model forecast for Monday_night just in has a lot in common with the GFS It keeps the rain-snow_line well east of Interstate_95 and dumps a ton of snow in the immediate DC area Graphics coming in a few The fun is not over yet The Canadian model is in Looking at it now and will have comments in a few minutes How much snow are we talking_about if the GFS model is right Assuming temperatures are at or below freezing for most of the storm and rain or sleet doesnt mix with the snow the numbers are mind-bogglingIt suggests the immediate_metro area would get 10-15 inches of snow and our northern suburbs would see 15-20 inches all in the course of about 12 hours This would be a historic storm if that comes to passA couple caveats 1) This model sometimes over-predicts the amount of precipitation in these kinds of storms 2) Some of the snow that fell initially would probably melt (or be wasted) due to temperatures above freezing for a timeas well as above freezing ground temperatureBelow is a simulation of the storm from the GFS model The storm moves into Washington around 8 pm Monday_night and is on its way out by around 8 am Tuesday morning But in that time the model suggests it unloads A LOT of snow The GFS model is in and snow lovers in the Washington region will like it Its a cold snowy forecast Once the precipitation begins Monday evening temperatures quickly fall to 32 degrees or lower and the rain-snow_line is a good deal east of Interstate_95 The model produces over 14 inches of liquid equivalent in Washington which would convert to a lot of snow given the models temperature forecast Ill post some graphics shortly The GFS model is flowing in right_now so well have some comments on it in the next few minutesWhile this storm will impact DC it could be a much bigger deal to our northeast If you have travel plans in New England Tuesday into early Wednesday expect there to be disruptions Look at this forecast for snowfall amounts over the entire Northeastern US it is impressiveWidespread totals of at_least a foot are expected from eastern Pennsylvania to eastern Massachusetts In_addition to the two versions of the NAM_model discussed below there is actually a third one run at even a higher resolution (3 kilometers) which we call the NAM 3K It has a forecast product which shows how_much snow will fall each hour and its forecast of the snowfall in the hour ending at 4 am Tuesday morning is fascinatingFirst of all notice how sharply the snow cuts off just east of Interstate_95 But then notice how heavy the snow is west of Interstate_95 ripping at the rate of 1 to 2 inches per hourThis one graphic shows why the the location of the rain-snow_line will be so important in this storm and how small deviations could have huge implications for the forecast For snow lovers depressed by the NAM_model simulation just shown I should point out an alternative version of this model is run at a higher resolution and is colder and snowier than its low-resolution version Rather than the rain-snow_line hovering west of Washington throughout this event it straddles the Interstate_95 corridor in the high-resolution NAM and would give DC and its close-in suburbs more snow than low-resolution NAM forecastsIts forecast suggests at_least 2 to 4 inches of snow in the regionCompare that to the low-resolution NAM which only suggests 1-2 inches in the immediate_metro though a bit more to the north and west Below isa NAM_model radar simulation of Monday nights storm If youre snow lover along and east of Interstate_95 you may not want to look as it would be your worst case scenario Basically it shows the rain-snow_line west of the Beltway for a large part of the event which would mean mostly rain or a rain-snow mix near the city and points east It even suggests our nearby western suburbs could have a good deal of mixingThis is not a good model forecast if you like snow except perhaps if you live north and west of Leesburg and FrederickBut remember what I wrote in my 931 pm update were outside the range at which this model is considered pretty reliable so you can take it with a grain of salt That said if the GFS running in about 30 minutes is similar then its time to worry The NAM_model is in and produces a good deal of precipitation around 1-14 inches liquid equivalent which would convert to a healthy amount of snow if all the precipitation falls as snow and doesnt mix with rain But there are a few red flags for snow lovers in this run 1) Precipitation starts off as rain in Washington and doesnt change to snow until potentially after midnight 2) It is a relatively short duration event less_than 12 hours The precipitation starts around 8 pm and is all over between 6 and 8 am 3) The model tends to have a wet bias and sometimes simulates too_much precipitationIll show some graphics in my next update One thing this storm will have going for it if you like snow is a strong area of cold high pressure to the north and northwest The presence of this high pressure is critical for supplying sufficient amounts of cold air for snow to fallSome of you may recall the March 6 2013 Snowquester storm in which large amounts of snow were forecast but didnt materialize In that case there was no cold high pressure system to the north which shouldve been a big warning sign for forecasters As we await the NAM_model which is just starting to come in we want to note that this model usually performs best within about 24-36 hours of a storm event As were about 48 hours away from this still were a little outside its best range so take our reports on this model with a grain of salt In_addition to producing a most_likely snowfall forecast (see our first update from 850 pm) the National Weather Service now also issues forecasts for low-end and high-end possibilities For this particular storm in Washington its low-end forecast is 3 inches and its high-end forecast is 13 inches Thats quite a range but we think its a reasonable assessment given the complexity of the forecastThe potential minimum and maximums (min left max right)Literally the potential for 3 or 13 at DC (this will get narrowed in) TerpWeather (@TerpWeather) Normally at this time the NAM_model would be coming in so we could discuss it But there appear to be some delays at the National Weather Service (which runs this model) Well hopefully be able to start writing about it shortly To illustrate how close DC may be to the rain-snow_line Monday_night lets look at this (admittedly crude) representation of it from the SREF model (described below) The animation below shows three snapshots of the rain-snow_line Monday_night into Tuesday morning at 11 pm 2 am and 5 amNotice how the District goes from snow to rain to snow The rain-snow_line sets up right along Interstate_95 If youre north and west of it this group of models suggests you have a good chance to stay all snow But along it and especially to the south and east rain could mix in it times The first model well look at this evening is actually an average of a group of models known as the Short-range Ensemble Forecast System or SREF This group of models suggests the region will experience plenty of precipitation Monday_night into Tuesday the equivalent of 1 to 15 inches of rainOf course were expecting the majority of this precipitation to fall as snow Typically an inch of rain equates to about ten inches of snow But because Monday nights snow will be heavy and wet we might expect one inch of rain to equate to about seven inches of snow in the immediate_metro area Even with that assumption when you do the math this model is predicting the potential for a lot of snow with double digit totals possible in some areasA limitation of this model group is that some of the individual models which comprise it sometimes produce precipitation totals that are unrealistically high So its possible the amounts it is suggesting are slightly overdone To get us started lets take a look at the National Weather Service snow accumulation forecast The map below which was released at 810 pm predicts widespread totals of 4 to 10 inches with amounts increasing from southeast to northwest The highest amounts are north and west of the Beltway and a few spots in northern Maryland are predicted to exceed a foot The lowest totals are in southern Maryland where one to four inches or less are expectedTheres never a great time to fire off rockets potentially capable of carrying nuclear_warheads but China has been left in an awkward position by the timing of North_Koreas latest ballistic_missile test experts said Pyongyang said Monday that this weekends test of the medium- to long-range missile had been according to the official KCNA news_agency But there was probably a collective groan in BeijingThe missile_launch took_place while President Trump was playing host to Japanese_Prime Minister_Shinzo Abe and it will intensify pressure on China from both their countries to do more to restrain North_Koreas nuclear ambitions The United_States and Japan along with South_Korea requested an urgent meeting of the UN_Security Council in New_York on Monday_night to discussthe incident Russias Foreign_Ministry also expressed concern the state-run RIA Novosti news_agency reportedChinas Foreign_Ministry said Monday that it opposed the test with spokesman_Geng Shuang telling reporters that his government would take a constructive and responsible part in the discussions at the United NationsThe missile_test was conducted just as Sino-US_relations were beginning to look up a few_days after Trump held what the White_House said was an extremely cordial with Chinese President_Xi Jinping But Trump has made clear in the past that he does_not think China is doing enough to rein in its ally in Pyongyang Zhang Liangui a Korea expert at Beijings Central Party School which trains Communist Party officials said the timing was well thought through by Pyongyang to undermine Chinas ties with the United StatesIt clearly intended to affect the development of Sino-US_relations Zhang said But what matters is how China and the United_States handle itThe test also came as China campaigns hard against US plans to deploy the anti-missile Terminal_High Altitude Aerial Defense_(THAAD) system to South_Korea which Beijing considers a threat to its security It was a timely reminder to the Trump administration of why those missile_defense plans are important but also experts said to the candidates in this years presidential_election in South_Korea where public opinion on the issue is dividedThere was opposition in South_Korea to the THAAD_deployment said Cui Zhiying a Korean affairs expert at Tongji University But after the missile_test I fear these opposition voices will be greatly diminishedIn an editorial Monday the official English-language the missile_test provided a good excuse for the United_States and its military allies to step up their cooperationAs usual Foreign_Ministry spokesman_Geng argued that the cause of North_Koreas nuclear_program was its dispute with the United_States and called on all relevant parties to refrain from provoking each_other and escalating tensions in the regionChina has long said that dialogue and consultation are the only way forward but the Obama_administration had refused to talk unless North_Korea first pledged to denuclearizeIn an Monday Chinas nationalist Global_Times newspaper called North_Koreas nuclear_weapon and ballistic_missile program a severe annoyance for Northeast Asia but also said that Pyongyang faces a very real military threat as well as harsh sanctionsWe can imagine the level of its upset and rage it said If Washington keeps cracking down on Pyongyangs nuclear development while turning a blind eye to North_Koreas concerns their current confrontation will develop into an absurd struggle Earlier in the day to take stronger action against North_Korea after the missile_test the first conducted by Pyongyang since Trump took_office It said the test had improved the ability of Kim_Jong Uns government to put a nuclear_warhead on a missileAs a permanent member of the Security_Council and chair of the six-party talks and as a country that accounts for 90 percent of North_Koreas trade Chinas role is extremely important said Yoshihide Suga Japans chief cabinet secretary according to Bloomberg News As the government well continue to push China for constructive involvement at various levelsBefore taking office Trump North_Korea from acquiring the capability to strike the United_States with a nuclear_weapon In a joint appearance over the weekend Abe called the test absolutely intolerable and Trump said he stands by Japan 100 percentChina is North_Koreas primary ally and accounts for more_than 70 percent of its trade as well as providing food and energy aid Although it has supported limited sanctions by the Security_Council it is reluctant to take firm economic action that could destabilize the regimeNorth Korea has conducted five nuclear_tests including two last_year although its claims of being able to mount a nuclear_warhead on a missile have never been verified independently Kim said in his New Year speech that the North was close to test-launching an_intercontinental ballistic_missile (ICBM) potentially threatening the continental United_States which is about 5500 miles from North KoreaChina is unlikely to support tougher punishment for North_Korea unless and until it tests an ICBM or a nuclear_weapon said Euan Graham director of the International Security Program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney But he added that the latest test which appeared to be the second outing for a missile that could be fired from a submarine was a fairly significant step up the ladder and could threaten US bases in Asia Luna Lin and Xin Jin contributed to this_reportThe independent investigation_into Trump-Russia collusion just made its most serious move since it began in May Three former campaign officials have been charged with crimes one has pleaded_guilty President Trumps former campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort and his former business_partner Rick Gateswith12 counts of financial crimes related to their work in Ukraine over the past decadeAnd thespecial counsel announced that Trumps foreign_policy adviser George_Papadopoulos earlier_this month to giving false_statements to the FBI about his ties to aRussian-connected professor who promised dirt on Hillary ClintonNothing to see here Trump said of the newsSorry but this is years_ago before Paul_Manafort was part of the Trump campaign But why arent Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Also there is NO COLLUSION Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) But those definitive statements are very hard to make since legal experts say this is very likely to be the beginning not the end of the probe by special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III And no collusion is not ruled outWhile the White_House could say thatthese indictments dont advance the collusionnarrative they dont negate it either said Ira Matetsky a partner at New_York City-based Ganfer and Shore law firmHere are some ofTrumps common claims about the investigation and why the facts dont necessarily back them up yetIt is now commonly agreed after many months of COSTLY looking that there was NO collusion_between Russia and Trump Was collusion with HC Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Trumps main argument here is that the FBI in some form or another has been looking into this for more_than a year and that because it hasnt come to a conclusion about collusion there must be noneIts true that the Manafort and Gates indictment doesnt mention the Trump campaign and refers to alleged crimes over the past decadeBut that doesnt_mean the probe is over He could indict Manafort or anyone_else of collusion-connected crimes any time he has evidence to do so said Jens David Ohlin a vice dean at Cornell Law UniversityYou cant rule out that [Mueller] didnt rule out Manafort colluding with Russia Ohlin saidWe do know hes also looking into Donald Trump Jrs meetings withKremlin-connected Russians whether the president obstructed justice when James Comey was the FBI_director and Mueller wouldnt have hired 16 17 people to investigate these events just to indict some tangential person unrelated to the campaignsaid white-collar lawyer Jeffrey JacobovitzThe timing of the indictments is noteworthy too In just five months Muellers_team has impaneled a federal grand_jury and now is charging Trumps former campaign_chairman Those are both significant escalationsNor has Congress dropped its investigation_into collusionEarlier this month top Senate Republican and Democratic investigators that after eight months of investigating hundreds of hours of interviews with more_than 100 people and nearly 100000 pages of documents they arent ready to rule out collusionTranslation At the very least accusations that the Trump campaign worked with Russia are not a hoax Its worth significant time and resources forthree committees in Congress and one independent investigation to continue to look into on a variety of frontsManafort and Gates are charged with something that does_not seem directly related to Russia collusion and Trump has used that fact to argue that this has nothing to do with his campaignExcept Trump may be getting out ahead of himself Many legal experts think Mueller is putting pressure on these outside figures to get them to cooperateby sharing what they know about Trumps inner_circle If true that would explain the FBI knocking on Manaforts door in or the special_counsel CAnd then we get to Papadopoulos His guilty plea is directly related to Russia in that he gave false_statements to the FBI about his interaction with a Russian-connected professor during the campaign Muellerchose to telegraph on Monday thathe has someone on the inside of Trump world advising him which legal experts said underscores that this is far from overSome of Trumps allies have between the prosecutors Mueller has hired and their ties to Democrats Since Muellers_team is operating behind closed doors its been hard to directly rebut thatBut that logic falls into a gaping hole with this indictment Mueller has persuaded a federal_judge to set_up a grand_jury he has presented the evidence his team has found and that independent grand_jury decided to return an indictmentThis is out of Muellers hands Jacobovitz said Its an independent jury They could have declined the indictment but apparently they did notIts a first step and it could be one of many he saidFive million public school students in Texas will begin using new social studies textbooks this fall based on state academic standards that barely address racial segregation The states guidelines for teaching American history also do not mention the Ku_Klux Klan or Jim Crow lawsAnd when it comes to the Civil_War children are supposed to learn that the conflict was caused by sectionalism states_rights and slavery written deliberately in that order to telegraph slaverys secondary role in driving the conflict according to some members of the state board of educationSlavery was a side issue to the Civil_War said Pat Hardy a Republican board member when the board adopted the standards in 2010 There would be those who would say the reason for the Civil_War was over slavery No It was over states rightsThe killings of nine black parishioners in a South Carolina church last_month sparked a broad backlash against the to some a symbol of Southern heritage but to others a divisive sign of slavery and racismThere is also a call to reexamine a quieter but just as contentious aspect of the Civil_War in American society how the history of the war so central to our nations understanding of itself is presented in public school classrooms and textbooksIts the obvious question it seems to me Not only are we worried about the flags and statues and all that but what the hell are kids learning said Dan Quinn of the Texas Freedom Network a left-leaning advocacy organization that has been critical of the states academic standards in social studiesIf teaching history is how society shows younger generations who they are and where they came from the Civil_War presents especially because of the fundamental differences in the way the cause of the war is perceived 150years after its last battle Nowhere is the rejection of slaverys central role more apparent than in Texas where elected members of the state board of education to correct for what they said was a liberal slantStudents in Texas are required to read the Jefferson Davis gave when he was inaugurated president of the Confederate States of America an address that does_not mention slavery But students are not required to read a famous by Alexander Stephens Daviss vice_president in which he explained that the Souths desire to preserve slavery was the cornerstone of its new government and the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution Rod Paige a Republican who served as education secretary under President George_W Bush was among those who criticized the Texas board for minimizing difficult parts of the nations pastIm of the view that the history of slavery and civil_rights are dominant elements of our history and have shaped who we are today Paige told the board at the time according to the We may not like our history but its historyHistorians acknowledge that disagreements over states_rights played a role in the Civil_War But the states_rights issue was inseparable from slavery they say The right that states in the South were seeking to protect after all was the right to buy and sell peopleSouthern states made that clear in their declarations of independence from the union said James Grossman the executive director of the American Historical Association Slaverys primary role in driving the Civil_War is a matter of scholarly consensus he saidThe War happened only because of the determination of the leadership of eleven states to defend the right of their residents to own other human beings Grossman wrote in an e-mail The Civil_War was fought over the issue of slaveryHardy the Texas state board member who said the war was not about slavery did_not respond to requests for comment The boards chair Donna Bahorich also did_not respond to a request for commentQuinn of the Texas Freedom Network said the new textbooks that will arrive in Texas classrooms this fall manage to thread the needle meeting state standards while still acknowledging the importance of slaveryBut the books muddy things by presenting sectionalism and states_rights ideas throughout he said A lot of white southerners have grown up believing that the Confederacys struggle was somehow a noble cause rather_than a war in the defense of a horrific institution that enslaved millions of human beings are more politicized than any other state said Jeremy A Stern a historian who for the conservative-leaning Thomas B Fordham Institute in 2011 He gave Texass standards a D and wrote that the board was molding the telling of the past to justify its current viewsStern said the where the Civil_War started and where in June Dylann Roof allegedly gunned down nine black parishioners deserve an A and honestly address slaverys role in the conflict while also nodding to states_rights as an important issue at the time Are Southern states soft-pedaling the Civil_War By and large the answer to that would be no Stern said But he said there is often a difference_between state standards and what children actually learnFor decades some Southerners have emphasized states_rights as the cause of the war Nearly half of Americans 48percent believe that states_rights was the main cause of the war compared to 38 percent who said the main cause was slavery according to a 2011 Raul Cevallos a 2015 graduate of Texas Tech University said he was taught at his Dallas-area high_school that the war was caused by slavery But he said a group he founded to create political awareness last_year found that many young people are ignorant about historyThe group asked students three simple questions about the United_States including Who won the Civil_War for a video that later went viral online The Confederates answered one student The South said another Others said theyre werent sure But the same students answered questions about pop culture Who is married to Brad Pitt correctlyIf you dont_know about the Civil_War and you dont_know about things like slavery then you wouldnt really be able to understand why our society is the way it is today Cevallos said a sociologist who wrote the best-selling book says textbooks perpetuate myths about the Civil_War in order to avoid offending state textbook-adoption panels Nineteen states including almost all of those in the South adopt textbooks at the state level according to the Association of American PublishersI think we are at last seeing the de-Confederatization of America Loewen said And Im hoping that we will see some action towards de-Confederatizing our textbooksLoewen who has reviewed many textbooks said he has found many errors and omissions that help de-emphasize the role slavery played in causing the war Among the biggest and most common problems he said is textbooks failure to quote from key primary sources the Southern states declarations of secession which made clear that they were leaving the union to protect white citizens right to own slavesOur position is clearly identified with the institution of slavery reads signed in 1861Loewen identified one textbook in print for more_than half a century that quoted directly from South Carolinas secession document Thats admirable Loewen said but the quotation leaves out the documents direct language about the role of slavery in driving South Carolinas decisionHistory can be a weapon Loewen said and it has been used against all of us It makes us all stupid about the past and thoughtless about the present a Stanford professor emeritus and Pulitzer Prize-winning historian who co-authored American Pageant said Loewen is nitpickingI would defy anybody who read our text to conclude that we were unaware of slavery as the cause of the Civil_War Kennedy said He added that he and his co-author have bade farewell in the past to states that found the textbooks content objectionable Alabama has rejected the book for years because of what state officials consider derogatory portrayals of 19th century religious revivals among other reasonsWere not in the business of compromising our view of history so some state school board will be happy Kennedy saidPublishers of other textbooks also pushed back against Loewens criticisms Current titles for middle and high_school students clearly state that the Southern states desire to preserve slavery was the primary reason for secession said Laura Gamble a spokeswoman for PearsonCritics of Texass new history standards fear that their teaching about the Civil_War will spread to other states via textbooks that cater to the Lone Star state Texas is the second-largest market in the countryBut that narrative appears to be changing as digital books help publishers become more nimble said Jay Diskey of the Association of American PublishersA spokesman for the publisher McGraw-Hill Education asked whether the company changes Civil War-related passages in books used outside Texas said the company provides content that is tailored to the educational standards of statesStephen Wright an eighth-grade teacher in Nacogdoches a small and conservative East Texas town said some Texas students undoubtedly leave their classrooms believing that slavery was not the primary cause of the Civil_War But not his studentsWright said he has his students read the Southern state declarations of secession to learn for themselves what the war was about He deals with the Civil_War standards he has to teach the standards because they might show up on the states history test by explaining the reasons that some people believe the war happenedMan its all about slavery he said The students know thatThe and are both reporting that members of Donald Trumps campaign spoke with Russia frequently during the campaignIts worth noting that their reporting includes significant caveats Most importantly its not clear these discussions involved the campaign The Times says the contacts were with Russian intelligence officials while CNN says it was with Russian nationals known to US intelligence And as the Times notes it is not unusual for American businessmen to come in contact with foreign intelligence officials sometimes unwittingly in countries like Russia and Ukraine where the spy services are deeply embedded in societySo basically conclusions that this proves collusion_between the Trump campaign and the Russian_government are premature That claim is based on the preponderance of evidence rather_than any real conclusive and even anonymously sourced reportingBut importantlythe new reportsseem to contradict claims the Trump campaign and now the Trump White_House have made about their lack of contact with Russia They have said in various ways that there was no contact on multiple occasions and as recently as Tuesday afternoonTrump reportedly denied any campaign-season contact between those close to him and Russia after a mid-January news_conference After being asked about it at the end of the conference he didnt answer the question Reporters chased him down afterward at whichpoint and ABCs Cecilia Vega Trump flatly denied any contact between his associates or his campaign and RussiaFortunately ABCs Cecilia Vega asked my question about whether any Trump associates contacted Russians Trump said no Jim Acosta (@Acosta) you must have missed the part of my reporting that said trump came back and answered my first question with a firm no Cecilia Vega (@CeciliaVega) White_House press_secretary Sean_Spicer was asked Tuesday before the explosive reports came out if that was still the company line He didnt amend itQUESTION Back in January the president said that nobody in his campaign had been in touch with the Russians Now today can you still say definitively that nobody on the Trump campaign not even General Flynn had any contact with the Russians before the electionSPICER My understanding is that what General Flynn has now expressed is that during the transition period well we were very clear that during the transition period he did he did speak with the ambassadorQUESTION Im talking_about during the campaignSPICER I dont have any I theres nothing that would conclude me that anything different has changed with respect to that time periodWhite House counselor Kellyanne_Conway said this back in aDecember appearance on Face the Nationwith John DickersonDICKERSON Did anyone involved in the Trump campaign have any contact with Russians trying to meddle with the election Absolutely not And I discussed that with the president-elect just last night Those conversations never happenedI hear people saying it like its a fact on television That is just not only inaccurate and false but its dangerous and it does undermine our democracyThere was also then-Vice President-elect Pence during Jan 15 interviews in which he to the United_States Speaking to Fox_News Sundays Chris Wallace Pence also denied any contact between the campaign and the KremlinWALLACE Im asking a direct question Was there any contact in any way between Trump or his associates and the Kremlin or cutouts they had I joined this campaign in the summer and I can tell_you that all the contact by the Trump campaign and associates was with the American people We were fully engaged with taking his message to make America great again all across this country Thats why he won in a landslide election(CROSSTALK) -- if there were any contacts sir Im just trying to get an answer Yes I of course not be any contacts_between the campaign Chris the this is all a distraction and its all part of a narrative to delegitimize the election and to question the legitimacy of this presidency The American people see right through itAnd here he was the same_day on Face the NationDICKERSON Just to button up one question did any adviser or anybody in the Trump campaign have any contact with the Russians who were trying to meddle in the electionMIKE PENCE Of_course not And I_think to suggest that is to give credence to some of these bizarre rumors that have swirled around the candidacyAll of these statements could be parsed endlesslySpicers comments Tuesday dont seem to double down on Trumps words so much as not want to say anything new So he let Trumps comments standConway was responding directly to a question about contacting Russians trying to meddle with the election The new reports dont indicate that the contacts were specifically with such people so much as Russians tied to intelligence more generallyAnd Pence was asked specifically about contact with the Kremlin or cutouts they had Again the reports dont indicate direct contact with the Kremlin only Russian intelligence officials or Russians known to US intelligence (whose status might not have been known to the Trump campaign team per the Times)But these denials take a pretty hard line against the idea of any contact between the Trump campaign and Russia involving a whole lot of peopleAnd as we get more specific details well see how well they hold upAs White_House press_secretary Sean_Spicer tried to clarify his statement during a news briefing on Tuesdayit was clear that he was only adding to the heap of criticism he was about to get Washington_Post reporter Ashley Parker was listeningto him speak in the briefing room Little did she know that she was about to go viral too Parkers facial expressions as Spicer spoke were captured on video and broadcast along with his remarksPress Sec on Hitler/Assad comments He was not using the gas on his own people the same wayhe brought them into the Holocaust centers ABC News (@ABC) Soon Twitter had isolated a GIF of the whole thingthe journey in this gif is unbelievable Seb FoxAllen (@purpledocket) The GIF became a collective reaction meme for those who were stunned by what Spicer said a subtle real-time expression of how Twitter felt watching him speakParker a wise Twitter skeptic was nice enough to answer a few questions about the whole thing Our questions are in bold with her answers below them We condensed and edited for clarityIm going to betray my rather tenuous Millennial designation by revealing that I still dont really fully understand the difference_between a GIF and a meme But suffice it to say that shortly_after the briefing ended I realized that my eyebrows were all over the InternetI think I was vacillating between confusion and disbelief as Spicer unfurled his answer Because he had basically been given a pretty fair easy opportunity to clean up his earlier misstatement and instead we were all watching in real time as he made it infinitely worseI maintain my healthy skepticismI hope not While my interior monologue may have inadvertently played out on my face Im a pretty horrible liar generally I always try to be fair in my coverage and respectful in my relationships with the White_House (and anyone I cover for that matter) and I_think (I hope) that matters more_than a random raised eyebrow that happened to go viralMy favorite response was probably from friends family editors and even sources who all texted me to say We know that face Apparently Im both perpetually expressive and skeptical And shifty-eyedFORT BRAGG NC An apparent security lapse enabled a convictedmurdererto access Sgt Bowe Bergdahls sentencing

Southeast Washington 70-year-old Bradford Browns death was handled differently His family members said they were not told his life had ended until they tried to visit him a week after the fact and found an empty bedWhats more they said hospital officials lost track of his body for several daysThe events that ensued after Browns death in late July described by his relatives and discussed in a meeting with hospital officials that his daughter recorded and shared with The Washington_Post add a macabre subplot to the mounting troubles at the only hospital serving the poorest neighborhoods in the nations capital Ive been trying to get information and its just a merry-go-round I never get a straight answer said Meiko_Brown the dead mans 43-year-old daughter Its absolutely crazy Ive never heard of anything like thisBradford Brown had lived in UMCs nursing_home since 2015 when he suffered a debilitating stroke On Aug2 his sister Barbara Hunter and Meiko_Brown walked into UMCs lobby bearing a gift of ginger snaps and Lays potato chips for their relativeBefore a wall covered with portraits of the hospitals board members a receptionist told them there was no patient at the hospital named Bradford BrownPerplexed but not yet alarmed the family rode the elevator to Browns ward on the sixth floor where a nurse spotted them and asked a colleague Do they not know he expiredHunter an occupational therapist with long experience in health_care interjected Expired as in deadAs her 10-year-old began crying Meiko_Brown said she gasped and started to scream I completely lost it she said I couldnt breathe It was like something else took over my bodyBrowns records indicated he died after he was transferred to the emergency_room with breathing problems on July26 and that his family was notified the same daySeeking an explanation Meiko_Brown and Hunter met two days later with hospital officials UMC administrator Ola Fadairo could offer no insight into the mix-up but said officials were conducting an investigation of the incident and that it had been an eye-opener for the hospitalThere are errors in this Fadairo said according to Browns audio recording of the meeting Whoever is at fault we need to do some remodeling and fix the problemHe continued One thing I want to assure you is that we have taken steps to block this type of thing happening again Youve been a help to us and we continually need your support and help because we need to portray the image of this establishment This is the only black hospital so_far around here and we must do something to maintain it My sister youve been loved He has left a legacy for you Hold on to that legacy It is well Maam I feel you It is well Amen Fadairo promised the family a written report on the hospitals handling of the notification process in Browns death saying Were_going to get to the bottom of this This is not endingReached by telephone Friday morning Fadairo said the meeting had been the end of his involvement in Browns caseI was just there as a supervisor who is trying to appease them he said Fadairo who said he acts as a minister outside his hospital job said he had done his best to console Meiko_Brown and Hunter but had no idea what had become of the inquiry into whether Browns next of kin were properly notified of his death That was the duty of his colleagues in the nursing_home he saidI have no clue he said I did_not pursue the investigationThe only person in Browns circle who recalls speaking to hospital staff on July26 is An-Nas Osiris Bey who said a nurse called to tell him Brown had been transferred to the intensive care unit as he had in the past because of breathing problems Bey said he later received a second call from the hospital nurses station but that it was cut_off after he answered and nobody picked_up when he called backBey is a close family friend who visited Brown frequently at the hospital and had given hospital officials his phone numberIn the recording of the Aug4 meeting a nurse said she called Bey after Brown was dead and said during their brief conversation that she was sorry for the loss When Bey did_not react to her comment she said she suspected he had not been notified and rather_than telling him suggested he check on Brown at the emergency roomI said So are you on your way to the ER In my head I was like Maybe they havent informed him about it Let_me not push the nurse said I told my director of nursing Hmm its like they havent informed him yetBey said he did_not remember the nurse ever saying sorry for the lossIn response to questions from The_Post a UMC spokeswoman issued a brief written statement We have reviewed the circumstances of this case and confirm that the hospital followed all proper protocols including notification to the next of kin in a timely mannerThe Post spoke to each of Browns four children who live in the Washington region All said they had been informed of their fathers death by Meiko_Brown when she learned upon her visit to the hospitalHis surviving relatives said their back-and-forth with UMC has aggravated their grief for Brown a retired tailor known among friends and relatives for his sometimes baroque sweet tooth peanut butter and jelly on pound cake was among his preferred dishes and sense of humor On his daughters 25th birthday he gave her an elaborately gift-wrapped rock with the words Hard head soft a-- written on it in indelible markerAnd this week family members said the saga took another exasperating turnHunter Bey and Meiko_Brown said they were unable to view Bradford Browns body in the weeks after he died told by hospital officials that there was no convenient place to do so They said they became suspicious about the circumstances of his death and hoped that if his body reached a city coroner after 30days according to city law hospitals must transfer unclaimed bodies to the medical examiners office an autopsy might be performedBey said a hospital official told him the corpse would be sent to the medical examiners office when the 30-day period ended last Saturday On Monday Meiko_Brown called the medical examiner and was told the body was still at UMCFor the next several days she said she continued to call the hospital trying to ascertain the whereabouts of her fathers corpse but each time hospital staff told her they were unsure and would have to call her backOn Thursday the same_day The_Post called hospital officials with questions about the case Bey said he finally received a call from the medical examiners office telling him the body had arrived that afternoonIts far from clear that the medical examiners office will probe more deeply into Browns cause of death because such scrutiny is typically reserved only for suspicious casesBut Browns relatives said that regardless of what happens they hope for some understanding and closure now that Brown is no_longer in the custody of UMCWe havent even seen his body yet Bey said We dont even know

ban on transgender_people enlisting receiving Armed Forces medical care for sex-reassignment surgeries and possibly continuing to serveThe suit filed in federal court in Maryland on behalf of six active-duty military members argues that the ban is unconstitutional because it discriminates against transgender peopleIts such an egregious attempt to target transgender individuals who have devoted their careers and lives to the United_States said Chase Strangio a staff attorney for the ACLU The president claims in tweets transgender_service costs money and military readiness The reality is the Department of Defense concluded after years of study that is baselessA Defense_Department spokesman referred questions to the Justice DepartmentWe are examining the claims in this lawsuit and conferring within the Government the Justice_Department wrote in a statementThe lawsuit was filed days after Trump formally ordered the Pentagon to ban the recruitment of openly transgender_people and to determine_whether those already serving should be allowed to remain It is at_least the third civil suit challenging Trumps transgender military ban In late July Trump first floated his plan for a transgender military ban in a After consultation with my_Generals and military experts_please be advised that the United_States Government will not accept or allow Transgender_individuals to serve in any capacity in the US Military Trump wrote Our_military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous_medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entailThe decision was cheered by many religious conservatives but angered LGBT activists liberals and some in Trumps own party such as Sen John_McCain (R-Ariz) who complained about the president rolling out a major policy on Twitter and possibly forcing people out of the military who were otherwise qualifiedThe ban reversed an Obama_administration decision to allow transgender_people to serve_openly The armed_forces were set to begin enlisting transgender_people July1 but Defense_Secretary Jim_Mattis delayed that move citing a need for more studyBefore the policy change by the Obama_administration the Pentagon had concluded that there was no basis for the military to exclude transgender_people There is no official tally of transgender military members and estimates vary widely One by the Rand_Corp put the number on active_duty at about 2500 while from the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School estimated that there were 15500 on active_duty in the

FBI Naturally Americans wanted to know WhyThe exact answer remained elusive over the course of three days following the announcementTrump and his White Housegave numerous contradictory explanations for James_B Comeys firingAs a public service we compiled a timeline of the shifting rhetoric by Trump and his staff We will update this list as necessaryThe original explanation from Trump and his White_House was that Deputy_Attorney General_Rod J_Rosenstein and Attorney_General Jeff_Sessions In a Rosenstein criticized Comeys_handling of the FBIs investigation_into Hillary_Clintons private email_server use as secretary of state He did_not explicitly call for his dismissalSessions forwarded the letter to Trump recommending he remove ComeyTrump then wrote a letter to Comey saying he was acting on their recommendationWhite House Press Secretary Sean_Spicer issued a statement with the White_House senior adviser Kellyanne_Conway echoed it on CNN I would point them to the three letters that were received today Anderson [Cooper] Ata news briefing later that night Spicer made it clear that the decision was made by DOJ and Rosenstein From our colleague Jenna Johnsons The next_day White_House spokeswoman_Sarah Huckabee_Sanders revealed Trump actually asked for the recommendation of Rosenstein and Sessions Trump had been losing confidence in Comey for months and had been considering firing him since Election_Day she said CNNs Jonathan Karl asked Sanders Sanders answered Vice_President Pence that Trump decided to act on the recommendations by Rosenstein and Sessions and that Rosenstein independently had decided to conduct an investigation of Comeys_handling of the Clinton probePENCE the AGs office acted independently in reviewing and recommending that FBI_Director Comey be fired Via Jennifer Grygiel (@jmgrygiel) Separately Trump told_reporters that he fired Comey because he wasnt doing a good job Very simple He wasnt doing a good jobLater that day the White_House released an official timeline of Trumps decision-making processThen that evening The Washington_Posts that Rosenstein threatened to resign after the narrative emerging from the White_House on Tuesday_evening cast him as a prime mover of the decision to fire_Comey and that the president acted only on his recommendationThe president then contradicted his staffs earlier comments In a preview video clip of his Trump said he planned to fire_Comey all along regardless of Department of Justice recommendations The that RosensteinIn a subsequent news briefing Sanders clarified her comments from the previous day Trumps Monday meeting with Rosenstein and Sessions reaffirmed what Trump already was planning to do she saidWH spox Sarah_Huckabee Sanders Ive had that conversation w/president now and he said hed been thinking about firing Comey for months Michelle Ye Hee Lee (@myhlee) Later on Thursday NBC aired itsfull interview with Trump In it Trump offered yet_another reason for firing Comey The FBIsinvestigation into Russias interference in the 2016_presidential election (Sanders had hinted at this earlier in the day saying the White_House believed that by removing Comey it took steps to make_sure the FBIs Russia investigation would come to its conclusion with integrity)In a closed-door briefing to the full Senate on May 18 Comey would be fired before he wrote his May 9 memo that the White_House used as justification to fire_Comey Rosenstein told senators he was not pressured into writing the memoHe learned the presidents decision to fire him and then he wrote his memo with his rationale said Sen_Richard Durbin (D-Ill)Meanwhile Trump said in a May 18 news_conference that firing Comey was something even Democrats wanted And he

hospital Key members of its management team had led a New_York hospital that filed for bankruptcy The District would become its sole clientAfter the administration of Mayor Muriel_E Bowser (D) who received more_than $35000 in political donations from the firms founders family and affiliated companies campaign-finance records_show authorized a no-bid contract for consultants to stanch financial losses at United Medical_Center Veritas began work for a fee of $300000 permonthA year and a half later the hospital continues to face financial uncertainty and is coping with new medical crises including regulators closure of the obstetrics_ward last_month because of unsafe conditions And public records reviewed by The Washington_Post show Veritas has failed to meet a number of the citys standards for managing the hospital A recent report on the Veritas contract by city officials states the firm which has collected about $5million in taxpayer dollars has delivered about a tenth of the $9million in extra revenue it projected it would generate for the hospital this fiscal year Veritas is on track to meet its overarching mandate District officials predict the hospital will end the year with a razor-thin profit margin after years of red ink and taxpayer subsidies But records_show that is largely because of billing improvements overseen by DC Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey S DeWittMeanwhile the companys employees have billed tens of thousands of dollars in work-related expenses to the cityThe District is reimbursing two Veritas managers hospital chief_executive Luis Hernandez and quality manager Diane Kelly an average of more_than $7400 a month to fly back and forth to DC from their homes in Florida and North Carolina During the week the District pays for them to rent apartments at National Harbor in Maryland according to expense reports reviewed by The_Post Even their gas and electricity bills are reimbursed by taxpayersSuch spending has continued as UMC remains in precarious financial shape and continues to generate complaints from its patients many of whom come from the poorest and most violent neighborhoods in the nations capitalFiniya Johnson 20 gave birth at UMC in January before health regulators halted deliveries She said only one doctor was attending to multiple women on the obstetrics_ward and as a result nurses tried to delay her delivery When her son was born he was not breathing and needed to be resuscitated she saidIts just horrible Johnson said standing outside the hospital on a recent morning after a pediatric appointment for her son I dont_know where their money going Veritas officials declined to provide details about their $36 million annual fee and refused to disclose the salaries of the three executives who work full-time at UMC saying they are not subject to the Districts public-information laws because they are paid by Veritas rather_than the hospital Hernandez and Kelly declined to comment through a hospital spokeswomanCorbett Price the companys executive chairman said Veritas was doing its job Steadying the hospitals financial situation so the District could find a private company to build a new hospital on the east side of the cityBut Price who is married to Veritas owner Chrystie_Boucre cautioned against setting expectations too high for an institution that has struggled as long as UMCIt has a historical pattern No company can instantaneously come in to correct that Price said There will be no miracle turnaround so to speakDC Health Care Finance Director Wayne Turnage who recommended Veritas to the hospital board last_year said despite its shortcomings the company was meeting its broad goal of stabilizing a beleaguered medical facilityCan they do better Absolutely Turnage said But you also have to think about the hospital theyre working in Were not talking_about a well-funded state-of-the-art hospitalSince it opened 50 years_ago Southeast Washingtons only fullservice hospital has struggled to find an economically viable formula for providing care to the poor and mostly African American neighborhoods east of the Anacostia RiverThe hospital which sits at the Districts border with Maryland went through bankruptcy about 20 years_ago and after a turbulent period of corporate management that included the loss of its accreditation was taken over by the city in 2010The move came as many municipalities were abandoning public hospitals because of their financial challenges including the District which closed DC General Hospital in 2001 The city agreed in 2013 to a two-year $128 million contract with Huron Consulting a national firm specializing in hospital turnarounds The company deployed dozens of its employees to the hospital and improved UMCs operating margins but was unable to find a long-term operator to take over the hospital when its contract expired In 2015 the hospital required a $7 million subsidy from the District to meet its payroll the next year that rose to $10 million In early 2016 the mayor decided the hospital board should invoke its emergency authority to select a new consultant Turnage recommended VeritasAt the center of the company is Price who has built a lucrative career in the halls of struggling hospitals throughout the I-95 corridor His constellation of consulting firms has thrived along the border between public and private health_care a field where business models collide with the reality of caring for societys sickest and poorest and success often means postponing failureHe began his career at the for-profit Hospital Corporation of America in the 1980s After that companys contract to run Prince_Georges Hospital Center ended he stayed on as hospital chief_executive But the hospitals board soon replaced him as it sought a speedier turnaround said former Prince_Georges County executive and longtime board member Winfield M Kelly JrIt didnt work real well for us Kelly recalled He tried real hard he tried to get it done he didnt get it done Competent guy it just didnt work outIn 1990 Price founded Kurron Shares of America a consulting_firm that soon took over the management of Interfaith Medical_Center in Brooklyn Two decades later the companys stewardship ended after the hospital filed for bankruptcyAn ombudsman appointed by the bankruptcy court found lapses in care at the facility particularly the emergency_room which he described in a report as more chaotic and disorganized than others he had seen The ombudsman asserted Price the chief restructuring officer visited the hospital infrequently and should be more actively engaged in the day-to-day on-site responsibilities of the hospitalIn a response to the report lawyers for the hospital said the criticism stemmed from a misunderstanding of Prices role which was not running the hospital on a day-to-day basisIn the spring of 2013 the New_York State_Department of Health barred Kurron from continuing to manage the hospital Spokeswoman Jill Montag said in a statement to The_Post that regulators had concerns about the pay provisions in Kurrons contract including those for open-ended reimbursement of expenses and bonuses to the companys executivesPrice blamed the hospitals financial failure on New_York state cuts to Medicaid rates in 2011 He said Interfaith would have run aground much sooner without his firm Kurron did an outstanding job if I may say so myself based on our longevity there People forget that he saidFor two_decades Prices family and companies had contributed to New_York politicians but written only a handful of checks to campaigns in the District none of them to Bowser That changed a little over a year after Kurron had been forced out of Interfaith Medical CenterIn 2014 Price his relatives and his companies made $35191 in political_contributions to Bowser records_show including $20000 in contributions to Bowsers inaugural committee from Price and Mantium a Bethesda-based corporation registered in his namePrice said he met Bowser while she was campaigning and had no anticipation of future business_dealings with the cityI live in Washington I believe in your responsibility as a citizen there he said Just because I give to someones campaign I dont expect anything in returnIn 2015 Bowser appointed Price to the board of the regions public-transit system She said in a recent interview she met Price through his in-laws whom she had represented as a Ward 4 council memberPrices financial support for her political career had nothing to do with his Metro board appointment or with the selection of Veritas to run UMC the mayor saidEverybody involved in our administration made decisions based on the best interests of the District of Columbia and UMC she said We had a situation where we could not make payroll at a hospital that serves a key part of the city and we had no confidence that the people in place would be able to turn that aroundTurnage said it had been his idea to bring Veritas on at the hospital He said he and Price met in 2015 and bonded over their shared alma mater Ohio State University Informal discussions about how to shore up UMC followed Turnage said and he ultimately recommended Prices company to the UMC board because he believed their fees were lower than better-known competitorsHe said an emergency contract was necessary because the normal competitive bidding process would have taken too longI can assure you that I had no discussions with anybody in the mayors office about these contracts Turnage saidCraig Holman of the nonprofit Public Citizen said the placement of campaign donors at the helm of a struggling public hospital could nevertheless raise questions about the Bowser administrations oversight of the facility Whether or not her actions were appropriate its going to raise questions and red flags anytime someone who is a government contractor gets involved in making campaign contributions Holman saidSince 2014 Prices family and related companies have also given $6000 to the campaign of council member Brandon T Todd Bowsers hand-picked successor for her Ward 4 DC Council seat and $3000 to former council member LaRuby May a Bowser ally whom the mayor appointed chairwoman of the UMC board this year according to campaign-finance recordsMay declined to comment on her ability to oversee the Veritas contract in light of those donations She said in a brief interview that the hospital has not provided the highest level of patient quality services but is headed in the right directionEven by the standards of struggling public hospitals UMC has been buffeted this year by an extraordinary succession of bad newsMedicare billing errors led to a 45 percent operating deficit in February that had city officials briefly worried about another taxpayer subsidy That was followed by a $122000 fine by the DC Department of Health in April for poor patient care at the hospitals nursing homeCity officials say they are now girding for legal claims over the problems that led regulators to shutter the nursery and delivery rooms including what District health regulators said was a failure to take routine steps to prevent a newborn from contracting HIV Just last_week a family came forward to complain they had not been notified of a loved ones death at the hospital until a week had passed UMC executive David Boucre the third Veritas employee who works full-time at the hospital said it would take time to reverse the hospitals history of dysfunctionBoucre who is the cousin of Prices wife said his professional background was in information technology including work with health_insurance companies and outsourcing He said Veritas had made improvements to the hospital that included hiring additional urology and gastroenterology doctors and refurbishing the behavioral-health unit and surgical suiteWere advancing the ball Boucre said Theres still a lot of work thats left to be done I dont_think anyone expected it all to be done in six_months nine months a year or two yearsSince December Turnage and DeWitt have conducted monthly assessments of Veritas performance in categories such as patient admissions baby deliveries and lab visitsAt the time of the most recent review in July the firms year-to-date record showed it falling short in 41 percent of its metrics according to a report reviewed by The_Post DeWitt and Turnage noted Veritas had realized $107million of the $9 million in revenue its executives had said they could generate by reforming hospital operationsAll agree that the performance for a myriad of reasons has lagged Turnage wrote in August to city officials (In an_interview Turnage said he was referring specifically to the consultants failure to generate new revenue rather_than their overall performance) Still the hospital is on course to end the year in the black thanks to several million dollars generated by improvements to the billing process made by the citys chief financial officer he saidWithout this surprise Turnage wrote the hospital would be underwaterAlthough city officials said the firm was chosen in part because of its familiarity with the District two of the threemanagers Veritas put in charge of the hospitallive hundreds of miles awayHernandez the chief_executive who held the same role at Interfaith Medical_Center under Prices contract in New_York flies

bocce court where according to the buildings website Luxury flows to you Veritas can bill the city for up to $700000 over three years for work-related expenses under the terms of its contractDC Council member and health committee chairman Vincent Gray (D-Ward 7) who is widely believed to be considering a challenge to Bowser next year said such spending is unacceptableFor a hospital that is financially strapped that is being supported by the District of Columbia taxpayers this seems like an incredible waste of money said Gray who was mayor until 2015 and oversaw the citys previous hospital-management contract with the national firm Huron Consulting Its shocking that money would be spent in these waysTurnage said the expenses are reasonable because qualified hospital-turnaround experts are rare and cant be expected to move to a new part of the country for a short-term contract He said Hurons incidental expenses were included in their base fee and so could not be directly compared to those of VeritasIt is common for turnaround firms to bring in out-of-state consultants whose travel and lodging costs are billed to a client particularly if those experts have special skills health-care industry analyst Paul Keckley said The ultimate measure of whether their costs are justified Keckley said are their resultsEvery one of them is going to kind of have their own approach he said Sometimes its smoke Thats the thing Consulting is often in the eye of the beholder Julie_Tate contributed to this_reportThe United Arab_Emirates arranged a secret meeting in January

adds to an expanding web of connections between Russia and Americans with ties to Trump contacts that the White_House has been reluctant to acknowledge or explain until they have been exposed by news organizationsWe are not aware of any meetings and Erik Prince had no role in the transition said Sean_Spicer the White_House press secretaryA Prince spokesman said in a statement Erik had no role on the transition_team This is a complete fabrication The meeting had nothing to do with President Trump Why is the so-called under-resourced intelligence_community messing around with surveillance of American citizens when they should be hunting terroristsPrince is best known as the founder of Blackwater a security firm that became a symbol of US abuses in Iraq after a series of incidents including one in 2007 in which the companys guards were accused and later criminally convicted of killing civilians in a crowded Iraqi square Prince sold the firm which was subsequently re-branded but has continued building a private paramilitary empire with contracts across the Middle_East and Asia He now heads a Hong Kong-based company known as the Frontier Services GroupPrince would probably have been seen as too controversial to serve in any official capacity in the Trump transition or administration But his ties to Trump advisers experience with clandestine work and relationship with the royal leaders of the Emirates where he moved in 2010 amid mounting legal problems for his American business would have positioned him as an ideal go-betweenThe Seychelles_meeting came after separate private discussions in New_York involving high-ranking representatives of Trump with both Moscow and the EmiratesThe White_House has acknowledged that Michael T Flynn Trumps original national_security adviser and Trump adviser and son-in-law_Jared Kushner met with the Russian_ambassador to the United_States Sergey_Kislyak in late November or early December in New YorkFlynn and Kushner were joined by Bannon for a separate meeting with the crown prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan who made an undisclosed visit to New_York later in December according to the US European and Arab officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive mattersIn an unusual breach of protocol the UAE did_not notify the Obama_administration in advance of the visit though officials found out because Zayeds name appeared on a flight manifestOfficials said Zayed and his brother the UAEs national_security adviser coordinated the Seychelles_meeting with Russian_government officials with the goal of establishing an unofficial back channel between Trump and PutinOfficials said Zayed wanted to be helpful to both leaders who had talked about working more closely together a policy objective long advocated by the crown prince The UAE which sees Iran as one of its main enemies also shared the Trump teams interest in finding ways to drive a wedge between Moscow and TehranZayed met twice with Putin in 2016 according to Western officials and urged the Russian leader to work more closely with the Emirates and Saudi_Arabia an effort to isolate IranAt the time of the Seychelles_meeting and for weeks afterward the UAE believed that Prince had the blessing of the new administration to act as its unofficial representative The Russian participant was a person whom Zayed knew was close to Putin from his interactions with both men the officials saidWhen the Seychelles_meeting took_place official contacts_between members of the incoming Trump administration and the Russian_government were under intense scrutiny both from federal investigators and the pressLess than a week before the Seychelles_meeting US intelligence_agencies released a report accusing Russia of intervening clandestinely during the 2016 election to help Trump win the White HouseThe FBI was already investigating communications between Flynn and Kislyak first disclosed those communications on Jan12 around the time of the Seychelles_meeting Flynn was subsequently fired by Trump for misleading Vice_President Pence and others about his discussions with KislyakYousef Al Otaiba the UAEs ambassador in Washington declined to commentGovernment officials in the Seychelles said they were not aware of any meetings between Trump and Putin associates in the country around Jan11 But they said luxury resorts on the island are ideal for clandestine gatherings like the one described by the US European and Arab officialsI wouldnt be surprised at all said Barry Faure the Seychelles secretary of state for foreign affairs The Seychelles is the kind of place where you can have a good time away from the eyes of the media Thats even printed in our tourism marketing But I_guess this time you smelled somethingTrump has dismissed the investigations of Russias role in the election as fake_news and a witch huntThe level of discretion surrounding the Seychelles_meeting seems extraordinary given the frequency with which senior Trump advisers including Flynn and Kushner had interacted with Russian officials in the United_States including at the high-profile Trump_Tower in New YorkSteven Simon a National_Security Council senior director for the Middle_East and North Africa in the Obama White_House said The idea of using business cutouts or individuals perceived to be close to political leaders as a tool of diplomacy is as old as the hills These unofficial channels are desirable precisely because they are deniable ideas can be tested without the risk of failureCurrent and former US officials said that while Prince refrained from playing a direct role in the Trump transition his name surfaced so frequently in internal discussions that he seemed to function as an outside adviser whose opinions were valued on a range of issues including plans for overhauling the US intelligence communityHe appears to have particularly close ties to Bannon appearing multiple times on the Breitbart satellite radio program and website that Bannon ran before joining the Trump campaign In a July interview with Bannon Prince said those seeking forceful US leadership should wait till January and hope Mr Trump is elected And he lashed out at President_Barack Obama saying that because of his policies the terrorists the fascists are winningDays before the November election Prince appeared on the Breitbart radio program saying that he had well-placed sources in the New_York City Police Department telling him they were preparing to make arrests in the investigation of former congressman Anthony_Weiner (D-NY) over allegations he exchanged sexually explicit texts with a minor Flynn tweeted a link to the Breitbart report on the claim No arrests occurredPrince went on to make unfounded assertions that damaging material recovered from Weiners computers would implicate Hillary_Clinton and her close adviser Huma Abedin who was married to Weiner He also called Abedin an agent of influence very sympathetic to the Muslim BrotherhoodPrince and his family were major GOP donors in 2016 The Center for Responsive Politics reported that the family gave more_than $10 million to GOP candidates and super PACs including about $27 million from his sister DeVos and her husbandPrinces father Edgar Prince built his fortune through an auto-parts company Betsy married Richard DeVos Jr heir to the Amway fortuneErik Prince has had lucrative contracts with the UAE government which at one point paid his firm a reported $529million to help bring in foreign fighters to help assemble an internal paramilitary force capable of carrying out secret operations and protecting Emirati installations from terrorist attacksThe Trump administration and the UAE appear to share a similar preoccupation with Iran Current and former officials said that Trump advisers were focused throughout the transition period on exploring ways to get Moscow to break ranks with TehranSeparating Russia from Iran was a common theme said a former intelligence official in the Obama_administration who met with Trump transition officials It didnt seem very well thought out It seemed a little premature They clearly had a very specific policy position which I found odd given that they hadnt even taken the reins and explored with experts in the US government the pros and cons of that approachMichael McFaul former US ambassador to Russia said he also had discussions with people close to the Trump administration about the prospects of drawing Russia away from Iran When I would hear this I would think Yeah thats great for you guys but why would Putin ever do that McFaul said There is no interest in Russia ever doing that They have a long relationship with Iran Theyre allied with Iran in fighting in Syria They sell weapons to Iran Iran is an important strategic partner for Russia in the Middle EastFollowing the New_York meeting between the Emiratis and Trump aides Zayed was approached by Prince who said he was authorized to act as an unofficial surrogate for the president-elect according to the officials He wanted Zayed to set_up a meeting with a Putin associate Zayed agreed and proposed the Seychelles as the meeting place because of the privacy it would afford both_sides He wanted to be helpful one official said of ZayedWealthy Russians and Emirati royalty have a particularly large footprint on the islands Signs advertising deep-sea fishing trips are posted in Cyrillic Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov owns North Island where Prince William and Catherine Duchess of Cambridge went on their honeymoon in 2011 Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan president of the UAE built a hilltop palace for himself with views across the chain of islandsThe Emiratis have given hundreds of millions of dollars to the Seychelles in recent_years for causes including public_health and affordable housing But when the Emirati royal_family visits they are rarely seenThe jeep comes to their private jet on the tarmac and they disappear said one Seychellois official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did_not want to be seen as criticizing the EmiratisZayed the crown prince owns a share of the Seychelles Four Seasons a collection of private villas scattered on a lush hillside on the main islands southern shore overlooking the Indian Ocean according to officials in the Seychelles The hotel is tucked away on a private beach far from the nearest public roadCurrent and former US officials who have worked closely with Zayed who is often referred to as MBZ say it would be out of character for him to arrange the Jan11 meeting without getting a green light in advance from top aides to Trump and Putin if not the leaders themselves MBZ is very cautious said an American businessman who knows Zayed and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject There had to be a nodThe Seychelles_meeting was deemed productive by the UAE and Russia but the idea of arranging additional meetings between Prince and Putins associates was dropped officials said Even unofficial contacts_between Trump and Putin associates had become too politically risky officials said Sieff reported from the Seychelles Julie_Tate Devlin_Barrett Matea Gold Tom_Hamburger and Rosalind_S Helderman contributed to this_reportThe acting chief of the Bill Hillary and Chelsea Clinton_Foundation acknowledged in a new statement that the global philanthropy launched 15 years_ago by the former president has made missteps but defended the organizations charitable work and its commitment to transparencyThe new posted Sunday to the organizations blog comes in a response to a flood of scrutiny of the charity and its donors that has coincided with Hillary_Rodham Clintons entry into the presidential campaign The attention has led Republicans to charge thatClinton istoo cozy with donors who have given millions to her familys foundation helping to burnish her reputation in the processIt has also threatened the reputation of the charity which runs health and poverty reduction programs around the worldThe foundations acting chief_executive officer Maura Pally said in the statement that the organizationhas instituted new commitments to openness as its impact has grown When Hillary_Clinton became secretary of state in 2009 the foundation began annually disclosing its donors which is not required by law and instituted new procedures for accepting contributions from foreign_governments (The agreement with the Obama_administration was not a ban the foundation has acknowledged accepting millions from foreign_governments in these years)[]After Clinton entered the race the foundation announced that it would accept donations only from a handful of countries that have funded continuing programs The foundationalso said it would begin disclosing its donors four times a yearAt the same_time the foundation confirmed last_week that it is likely to resubmit several years of tax filings to the Internal_Revenue Service after discovering that theyincorrectly reported that the organization received no support from foreign_governments in those years Pally stressed that the forms had accurately reflected the foundations overall revenue but said the filings would be correctedSo yes we made mistakes as many organizations of our size do but we are acting quickly to remedy them and have taken steps to ensure they dont happen in the future Pally said in the statement We are committed to operating the Foundation responsibly and effectively to continue the life-changing work that this philanthropy is doing every dayBill Clinton founded the organization in 2001 after leaving the White_House In the years since it has grown into a worldwide $2_billion enterprise In 2013 after Hillary_Clinton stepped_down as secretary of state she joined the foundations board and the organization added her name as well as that of daughter Chelsea to its title On announcing her presidential candidacy Hillary_Clinton stepped_down from the boardThe foundation announced last_month that former secretary of health and human services Donna Shalala a longtime Clinton ally would succeed Pally as the operational head of the charity Bill_Clinton remains on the foundations board as does daughter Chelsea who serves as the organizations vice chairThe organization has a complicated structure including 11 charitable initiatives some of which have at timesincorporated separately and filed their own tax_returns to the IRSIn her statement Pally highlighted the Clinton Giustra_Enterprise Partnership which works to alleviate poverty and is named for Frank Giustra a Canadian mining magnate who sits on the foundations board and is one of its largest donorsShe explained that the partnership receives direct funding from a separate organization by the same name that is based in Canada Unlike the Clinton_Foundation the Canadian Clinton Giustra_Enterprise Partnership does_not disclose its donors she said in keeping with Canadian lawThe partnership has received increased scrutiny in recent_days because of Giustras role in a last_week that looked at the role of foundation donors in a deal that resulted in a Russian state-owned company owning large deposits of uranium around the world including in the United StatesPallys explanation is intended to shed light on why certaindonors who have been publicly identified as contributors to the Clinton Giustra charitable effort do not appearamong donors listed on the Clinton Foundations Web siteThis is hardly an effort on our part to avoid transparency unlike in the US under Canadian law all charities are prohibited from disclosing individual donors without prior permission from each donor she said in the statementShe said the foundations rules were intended to assist it in its mission of addressing climate_change and childhood obesity and bringing low-cost drugs to people around the world Without question the Foundations accomplishments stand on their own she said One thing is clear The Clinton_Foundation has not been afraid to take on big challenges and see resultsRead moreAmid heightened scrutiny over the Clinton Foundations finances the organizations acting chief_executive recently released a statement in a blog post acknowledging mistakes in filing tax forms Pally defended a Canadian charity affiliated with the foundation which had come under fire for not disclosing its individual donorsCritics say that the Clinton_Foundation should voluntarily disclose information about donors to the Canadian charity the Clinton Giustra_Enterprise Partnership (Canada) as a part of a 2008 agreement between the Obama_administration and Hillary_Rodham Clinton to publicly disclose donors Learning about donors to the Canadian charity would reveal whether any may have had business before the State_Department when Clinton was secretary of State in President Obamas first termPally noted in her blog post that the charity under Canadian law is prohibited from disclosing individual donors without prior permission from each donor The charityhas begun reaching_out to its 28 largest donors out of 1100 totaldonors to seek permission to release their names (For more read Rosalind_S Heldermans earlier)The Fact_Checker does_not take a position on whether the donations should be made public Instead we examined the layers of Canadian legal requirements for charities to see which laws would apply to the Clinton Giustra_Enterprise Partnership (Canada) aka CGEPartnership Is Pallys statement accurateCGEPartnership raises money for the similarly-named Clinton Giustra_Enterprise Partnership one of the Clinton Foundations initiatives There is no blanket prohibition on charities to ever release donor names (Hat tip to Mollie Hemingway at of whether a blanket federal ban exists)Canadian privacy law is quite complex so we will spare our readers the minutiaeIn general charities registered with the Canadian federal government in the Income Tax Act the federal privacy law and any provincial laws that may applyThe Income Tax Act regulates whether the Canada Revenue Agency (equivalent of the Internal_Revenue Service) can disclose taxpayer information including donor information It does_not regulate whether a registered charity can disclose donor informationThe federal privacy law is called the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act or PIPEDA This law requires organizations to get permission from donors if they are releasing their information for a commercial purpose selling bartering or leasing of donor membership or other fundraising lists (This is a key point that we will return to momentarily)Most non-profits are not subject to the PIPEDA because fundraising is not a commercial activity But charities are not automatically exempt The law does_not prohibit charities from releasing information for non-commercial purposesAccording to Valerie Lawton spokeswoman for the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (the agency that oversees compliance with this law) If a charity is not engaged in a commercial activity such as selling bartering or leasing a donor list then PIPEDA would not apply to the charitys activities including whether it makes public a donor list That being said there may be other Canadian laws which dont fall under our jurisdiction that could apply to the publishing of donor listsThose other laws may be on the provincial level Not all provinces have their own privacy laws but British Columbia does And guess where CGEPartnership is domiciled Vancouver British ColumbiaBritish Columbias privacy law is stricter than the federal law though substantially similar to get donor permission when they collect use or disclose their personal information The province does_not have a public database that shows which charities are subject to this law and aspokeswoman for the Office of theInformation and Privacy Commissioner for British Columbia could not immediately confirm whether CGEPartnership was subject to provincial lawThis law does_not apply to federally-regulated organizations already governed by PEPIDAIt is not entirely clear which law applies to CGEPartnership The organization did_not clarify when we asked Some experts said it would operate under provincial law because the federal one generally applies to corporations like airports and banks Others also said it would make sense for CGEPartnership to be regulated by federal law as it applies to data that cross provincial or national borders and the charity is federally registeredCGEPartnerships memo about donor lists says the charity and its directors are mindful of their obligations under the federal law The charity has interpreted the release of donor names as bartering and considers it a matter of caution and good governance to take a wide view of the definition [of bartering] in terms of CGEPartnerships duty to keep donor information completely private without the consent of the donor or unless compelled by lawAdam Aptowitzer Ottawa-based charity lawyer said CGEPartnership is taking a rather shaky and an extremely conservative view of the law It is difficult to see how releasing the list would be bartering given that there seems to be no payment or consideration for the release of the listThe memo also says the Board of Directors has a fiduciary responsibility when maintaining its donor list especially for donors who gave money in confidence Using donor lists for any reason other than furtherance of its own current charitable purposes will constitute a breach of fiduciary duty it saysMany charities already get consent from donors to give recognition and have boilerplate language when asking for donations said Mark Blumberg Toronto-based charity lawyer CGEPartnership did_not answer The Fact_Checkers request for any consent agreements or policies for donorsMany organizations ask Do_you wish to remain anonymous This is pretty common stuff Blumberg saidThe Clinton_Foundation referred us toCGEPartnership and offered no comment though officials there were copied on emails [ After this fact check published CGEPartnership posted a for the media and released a legal opinion dated April 29 2015 Thelegal opinion which re-affirmed points in the charitys earlier memo is embedded below The attorneys have nowsaid the provincial law would apply in addition to the prohibition against bartering charitable donor lists under the federal law]The Clinton_Foundation said all charities are prohibited from disclosing individual donors without prior permission from each donor under Canadian law It is unclear_whether the foundation is referring to federal or provincial law If it is the later the statement would be accurateHowever the charitys own memo says it is operating under federal obligations and its fiduciary duty for its board of directors The federal law does_not explicitly ban charities from disclosing individual donor names without permission In fact it only applies to commercial use of personal information The public release of donor names for a non-commercial purpose is not prohibited The charity however interprets the release of donor records as bartering which experts have questionedThe charitys memo notes that under Canadian law donors have the right to privacy and that the board of directors has a fiduciary responsibility to use donors personal information for its own charitable purposes While that may be the case Pallys statement implies that there is a blanket Canadian law that bans charities from disclosing donor information without permission That is not exactly the case() byAs recently as two_weeks ago the president called the allegations that Russia helped him win the 2016 election a hoaxOne of the great hoaxes he said at a campaign rally in AlabamaThe Russia hoax continues now its ads on Facebook What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) As recently asThursday morning Trump seemed to suggest that the Senates top committee looking into Russia was looking into the wrong thingWhy Isnt the Senate Intel Committee looking into the Fake_News Networks in OUR country to see why so much of our news is just made up-FAKE Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Congress sees it differently The Senates investigation_into Russian_meddling and whether Trumps 2016 campaign helped isnt complete but lawmakers announced Wednesday that theyve reached some conclusions and those conclusionscontradict how Trump hasapproached RussiaHere are four things a Republican senator and a Democratic senator say they know about Russia after eight months of investigating hundreds of hours of interviews with more_than 100 people and nearly 100000 pages of documents reviewed Sen_Richard Burr (R-NC) chairman of the Senate_Intelligence CommitteeIn January the US intelligence communityto sabotage the presidential_election and help Trump win It was ordered by Russian President_Vladimir Putin himself We looked into it and theres no reason to doubt that conclusion Burr is saying even_though Trump has questioned it several_times BurrBurr was urging upcoming campaigns and state election officials to beon high alert that Russiawill try to mess with future elections But his advice could also apply to Trump who has been accused of brushing off the notion of Russia meddlingFacebook was always anti-TrumpThe Networks were always anti-Trump henceFake News (apologized) & were anti-Trump Collusion Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) BurrAt the very least accusations that the Trump campaign worked with Russia are not a hoax Its worth significant time and resources for the SenateIntelligence Committee to continue investigating Same goes for an independent investigation led by special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III Sen Mark R Warner (D-Va)The senators havent concluded much beyond ruling that Russia meddled in the election and could be trying to do it again Trump campaign officials meetings with Russians former FBI_director James_B Comeys allegations that Trump tried to get him to back off Russia and the Republican campaign platforms switch to a Russia-friendly positionBut thesenators were ready to definitively say that Russia did three things in the US election of the Democratic_National Committee and Hillary_Clinton campaign director John_Podesta to try to damage Clinton politically either to mess with the voter_registration or underminecitizensconfidence that their votes were accurately counted by buying ads and creating fake accounts with the aim to sow chaos or drive division in our countryI fear sometimes if you add up all this there was a decent rate of return Warner saidThe senators said they can certifiably say that Russia did_not change any votes that were castStates voter_registration systems and the systems that count votes are two different thingsThe consulting_firm charged with turning around the troubled United Medical_Center has told District officials it will replace the hospitals chief_executive The move comes on the heels of six council members filing a resolution disapproving of the proposed $42 million contract for Veritas of Washington LLC to continue its hospital management next year In a letter sent to the citys Department of Health Care Finance this week Veritas president Chrystie_Boucre said the company would launch a national search for a new CEO pending approval of the option year of the Veritas contract The removal of current CEO Luis Hernandez is effective immediately she wrote and she has asked the UMC Board to appoint David Boucre her cousin as interim CEOThe news was first reported by the Washington Business JournalVincent Gray the councils health committee chair called the CEO dismissal a Band-Aid approachThe systemic problems go beyond Veritass operational capacity he said in a statement Veritas a company led by campaign donors to DC Mayor Muriel_E Bowser (D) was brought on in April_2016 to stabilize the Southeast hospital But despite already collecting millions from the city it has failed to show measurable improvements Gray and other council members have grown increasingly critical of Veritass handling of UMC the Districts only public hospital and the only full-service one east of the Anacostia River The hospital has long been plagued with financial and quality issues Hernandezs ouster will mean UMC will be searching for its fourth CEO in about two yearsBoucre the pending interim CEO as being in information technology including work with health_insurance companies and outsourcingHernandezs contract expired on Sept 30 2017 but he will remain with the company to oversee other areas of the Veritas portfolio Chrystie_Boucre said in an emailed statement Hernandez lives in Florida but had been flying to the District for the CEO job and staying at an apartment in National Harbor with the city covering his travel and rent expense reports showed Its unclear_whether his new role will_continue that arrangement Under management by Veritas the hospital has had a number of high-profile incidentsDistrict regulators closed the hospitals obstetrics wing in August citing dangerous medical errors Those included failures to take basic steps to prevent a newborn from contracting HIV and to properly treat a woman with potentially fatal blood-pressure problems In July a 70-year-old patient died but and his family said hospital officials lost track of the body for several daysA Washington_Post review of public records in September found Veritas failed to meet several city standards for managing the hospital including delivering only $107 million of the $9 million in extra revenue its executives promised to generateGrays committee has scheduled a public roundtable session for Oct 30 to hear from hospital and Veritas employees to determine_whether to renew the contract UMC looks forward to the upcoming Councilmember Gray hearing and the opportunity to share with the City Council the initiatives that Veritas has undertaken to improve patient quality and safety Chrystie_Boucre said in her emailIn his statement Gray said I have a singular goal with the operations of the UMC which is to preserve lives and improve patient safety I filed a Disapproval Resolution on this Veritas contract because of their consistently poor performance The removal of their CEO is only an attempt to retain their $42 million contract I have yet to see a plan that sets forth a strategic direction on how Veritas will turnaround UMC operationsDC regulators ordered the only full-service hospital in Southeast Washington to stop delivering babies last_week because of dangerous mistakes the hospitals staff made with multiple pregnant women and newborns a letter obtained by The Washington_Post showsIn one case the hospitals staff members did_not take critical steps to prevent the transmission of HIV from an infected mother to her newborn such as delivering by Caesarean section or treating the infant shortly_after birth with antiretroviral medication according to the letter written by DC Health Department Director LaQuandra Nesbitt to the hospitals chief executiveIn another a morbidly obese woman who was about 35 weeks pregnant and had come to the hospital with trouble breathing was not properly monitored or treated despite a history of potentially fatal blood-pressure problemsThe letter does_not state what_happened to either woman or to the newborn or fetus and does_not identify them by name The Aug 7 letter provides the first official explanation albeit an incomplete one of why the Health Department took the dramatic step that day of at United Medical_Center a public hospital that serves the poor and predominantly African American residents of the neighborhoods east of the Anacostia RiverOfficials in Mayor Muriel_E Bowsers administration and Nesbitt an appointed member of her Cabinet have refused repeated requests from journalists and DC Council members to disclose the medical lapses that caused the closing of the hospitals delivery rooms and nursery They have also declined to release the letter obtained by The PostIn an_interview Friday Nesbitt repeatedly refused to say why her staff had shuttered the public hospitals obstetrics_ward asserting that to do so would violate the confidentiality of patientsWe found things that led us to decisions to restrict the hospitals license to not provide scheduled deliveries and the subsequent newborn nursery services that would occur Nesbitt said declining to specify what those issues werePressed about public concern over medical lapses at the hospital Nesbitt was firmTheres a difference_between using the word conceal as a journalist and recognizing that a government has the legal right not to disclose certain information she said when asked why health officials were concealing the medical mistakes they discoveredHospital managers have also not publicly disclosed details surrounding the closure saying in it had been caused by three separate cases involving deficiencies in screening clinical assessment and delivery protocolsThe statement said federal privacy laws preclude sharing specific details of these cases however UMC is taking immediate action to address these deficienciesHealth policy experts said it was not unusual for government officials to be tight-lipped about reasons for shuttering or restricting hospital services although inspection records are generally public The federal Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services for example posts inspection reports online for some hospitalsToo often however patients privacy is used as a pretext for withholding information the public deserves to know said Rosemary Gibson a patient advocate and adviser at the Hastings Center research groupThe entire system is based on trust Without being completely open and honest with the public how can the public know if a place can be trusted Gibson said If there was a single patient or very small number of patients patient privacy might come in to play But most often patient privacy becomes a cloak of secrecy to prevent the public from knowing risks that were allowed to festerDC Council member Vincent C Gray (D-Ward 7) the councils health committee chairman said in a statement Monday that the Health Departments refusal to disclose information to lawmakers or the public was unacceptableNesbitts letter to hospital chief_executive Luis A Hernandez written in highly technical medical language does_not answer key questions about lapses in the obstetrics_ward including what_happened to the mothers and infants who were involved in those lapsesThe letter lays out two categories of violations failure to comply with standards of good medical practice and failure to report a case of HIV infectionIn the case of a woman referred to only as Patient A who was infected with HIV and had a high viral load at the time of delivery the letter states that the hospital did_not deliver her baby by Caesarean section which the virus will be transmitted to the babyThe hospital also did_not conduct a common test for the presence of HIV in newborn or treat the infant with the antiretroviral drug Nevirapine between 48 and 72 hours after birth as recommended Nor did it report the mothers HIV infection to the Health Department as required by lawHospital staff members did_not properly monitor a second woman Patient B who was about 35 weeks pregnant and was in acute respiratory distress when she came for treatment The woman had a history of a blood-pressure condition that can be fatal for both mother and baby In a third case a newborn referred to as Infant A was not physically screened at the right time after birth Emma Brown

spectators likely to attend the games She said the city has committed to putting $2million toward the gamesWe think especially now it is important for the United_States to demonstrate that it is an open and welcoming place and it is especially important for us as Washingtonians to show that we are an international city and we celebrate sport Bowser saidThe DC Gay_Games Bid Committee paid for the travel to Paris with no cost to taxpayers said Brent Miner chairman of the committee Miner said Washington has 34 gay sports leagues and all have raised funds for the trip The bid also has corporate sponsors including United Airlines and Hilton Were making our way to Paris on Jell-O shots Miner said of one fundraising method Its fabulousBowser noted that the city has experience handling the security and demands that come with hosting major events In January the District hosted the presidential inauguration and next year it will host the Major League Baseball All-Star Game The District also made unsuccessful bids to host the 2024 Olympics and the 2014 Gay GamesEvents for the Gay_Games would mostly be staged in the District although some such as swimming sailing and a triathlon would be in Maryland and Virginia The opening ceremonies would be at the yet-to-be-completed DC United Stadium in Southwest Washington which is expected to be finished next yearAccording to the citys plans

along with Sheila Alexander-Reid director of the Mayors Office of LGBTQ Affairs were among those traveling to Paris Others in the delegation included community members and tourism industry leadersFor many who grew up in the LGBT community we may not have had as many opportunities to compete in sports because we either didnt feel comfortable or welcome Miner said So for many it is an opportunity to live out that part of their life that they did_not experienceChairing the Democratic_National Committee cant be all that Debbie_Wasserman Schultz had hoped it would Shes weathered slights and rebukes by the barrel and gets virtually no credit for any electoral gains Democrats have made during her time at the top of the partyAnd this week was particularly indicative of her tumultuous time as DNC chair and why the 2016 election cant come soon enough for herIt all began last weekend when At issue was the disqualification of 50-plus Sanders delegates by the convention credentials committee which was evenly split between Clinton and Sanders supporters The Sanders people were not happy and they got aggressiveWasserman Schultz went on CNN to blast Sanders for not directly condemning the actions of some of his supporters Unfortunately the senators response was anything but acceptable It certainly did_not condemn hissupporters for acting violently and instead added more fuel to the fireSuddenly Wasserman_Schultz was the story Liberals especially those aligned with Sanders had long believed that the Florida congresswoman (and the broader DNC apparatus she helms) had been working stealthily to elect Clinton even while maintaining neutrality in publicI dont_think she was fair liberal commentator Van Jones said of Wasserman_Schultz I_think she actually made it worse nowMorning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski said Wasserman_Schultz should resign alleging along-standingfavoritism for ClintonThis has been very poorly handled from the start It has been unfair and they havent taken him seriously and it starts quite frankly with the person that we just heard speaking [Wasserman Schultz]It just does She should step down She should step downWasserman Schultzs week got worse On Thursday Clinton sat for an_interview with CNN in which offering a not-so-subtle signal to the Vermont senator that it was time to goSenator Sanders has to do his part Clinton said Thats why the lesson of 2008 which was a hard-fought primary as you remember is so pertinent here Because I did my partNegotiating that detente is fraught with political peril particularly given just how nasty the race got this past week The responsibility to find that brokered peace falls at_least in part to Wasserman_Schultz Which means she may well have a few more rough weeks in front of herNearly six weeksafter the headless torso of journalist Kim Wall was found in waters off Copenhagen authorities said they foundvideo footage of women being tortured and decapitated on a computer hard drive reportedly belonging to the suspect in the case according toThat suspect prominent Danish inventor Peter Madsen has changed his story many times since Wall boarded his personal submarineto interview him on Aug_10 Wall was never seen alive again Her headless mutilated torso turned up nearly two_weeks later Authorities said the torso was bound to heavy metalto make it sink In a court hearing on Tuesday prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen said that officers found images onMadsens computer which we presume to be real of women being strangled decapitated and burned The videos were found in a laboratory run by MadsenWhile the cause of Walls death hasnt been established Bush-Jepsen said an autopsy showed knife wounds to Walls genitals and rib cage were caused around or shortly_after her deathMadsen who has denied charges of killing Wall and mutilating her body said the computer hard drive wasnt his They are the space laboratorys tools which have been used by everyone in the laboratory the 46-year-old inventor said during the pretrial session Wall 30 a freelance_journalist from Sweden was researching a story on Madsen andthe UC3 submarine he built at the time of her death She was an who wrote stories across the globe from Sri Lanka to North_Korea WhenWall didnt return from her interview with Madsen her boyfriend reported her missing At about the same_time Madsens prized submarine reportedly sank He initially told police that he had dropped Wall at the Copenhagen harbor and later barely escaped his sinking vesselBut a witness contradicted his story and police accused Madsenof deliberately sinking the vessel which he lateradmittedto doingAfter the submarine was retrieved Walls blood was found inside authorities saidMadsensoon changed his story and told authorities Wall died afterhitting her head on a submarine hatch cover and that he buried her at seaAfter her headless torso was found he denied dismembering her body Police from the torso to Walls toothbrush and hairbrush as well as the blood in the submarineMadsen was initially charged with involuntarily manslaughter but the charges were later changed to murderIn a court hearing last_month the

[Lee Harvey] OswaldThats taking the use of the cellphone too farRepublican nominee Donald Trump pleaded directly Wednesday with the Russian_government to meddle in the US presidential_election by finding and releasing tens of thousands of private emails from his Democratic_opponent Hillary_Clinton an extraordinary and perhaps unprecedented maneuver in American politicsRussia if youre listening I_hope youre able to find the 30000 emails that are missing Trump said during a news_conference at one of his South Florida resorts He added later They probably have them Id like to have them releasedAsked whether Russian espionage into the former secretary of states correspondence would concern him Trump said No it gives_me no pause If they have them they have themThe emails cited by Trump are from Clintons time at the State_Department where her use of a private_server prompted a federal investigation The FBI concluded that no prosecution was necessaryThose are different than emails from the Democratic_National Committee that were leaked ahead of the party convention here possibly with the involvement of Russia The FBI is investigating whether Russian state actors were responsible for leaking the politically damaging messages last Friday in an episode that forced the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie_Wasserman SchultzPresident Obama who was scheduled to address the convention on Wednesday_night told NBC News in an on Tuesday that Russia could be working to influence the electionWhat we do know is that the Russians hack our systems not just government systems but private systems Obama said What the motives were in terms of the leaks all that I cant say directly What I do know is that Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed admiration for Vladimir PutinClinton campaign_manager Robby Mook responded to Trumps Wednesday comments with a tone of disbelief telling reporters that the apparent hacking was a national_security issueIt appears the Russians did steal these emails from the DNC Mook said at a lunch sponsored by the Wall_Street Journal It appears as if they were active in releasing them for the purpose of hurting the campaignBut Rep_Devin Nunes_(R-Calif) the chairman of the House_Intelligence Committee said any such speculation is unfounded There is no_evidence absolutely no_evidence that the Russians are trying to influence the US election he said in an interviewDemocrats have labored all week to put Trump on the defensive over his business and personal ties to Russia as well as his professed admiration for its president Putin as a model leader Some have portrayed Trump as Putins Manchurian candidateVice President Biden roused thousands of delegates at the Democratic_National Convention here Wednesday_night by excoriating Trump as unfit to be commander in chief We cannot elect a man who belittles our closest allies while embracing dictators like Vladimir_Putin he said The candidate and several of his top advisers have business connections to Russia Campaign chairman_Paul Manafort has made millions of dollars in business deals with pro-Russia oligarchs as well as advised the Putin-aligned president of Ukraine whose 2014 ouster triggered Russias_intervention thereTrump seemingly played into Democratic hands on Wednesday by praising Putins leadership qualities and vowing that US relations with Russia would improve if he is elected in NovemberI dont_think Putin has any respect whatsoever for Clinton Trump said He added He has a total lack of respect for President Obama I_think hes going to respect your president if Im elected And I_hope he likes meIn a series of afternoon tweets Trump spokesman_Jason Miller said the candidate was merely encouraging other countries to turn over any information relating to Clintons emails to US authoritiesTo be clear Mr Trump did_not call on or invite Russia or anyone_else to hack Hillary_Clintons emails today Miller wrote Still Trumps provocation alarmed many Republican leaders and foreign_policy experts not only for his disjointed discussion of Russia but also for the signal it sent about their standard-bearers worldview Many were also alarmed by Trumps remark Wednesday that he would be whether Crimea which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014 should be recognized as Russian territory He has repeatedly questioned the need for NATO the main Western bulwark against Russia He told an Ohio rally crowd Wednesday_night that if a nation has not paid enough toward defense costs asks for help he would respond Bye byeRather than approaching Russia with trepidation Trump embraced Putin as a future ally and said he hoped to develop a chummy and mutually beneficial rapport with one of the globes notorious strongmen In doing so Trump broke with decades of Republican instincts that were honed during Ronald Reagans presidency at the end of the Cold WarForeign governments sometimes express preferences about who should be elected thats already problematic said Eliot A Cohen a former counselor in George_W Bushs State_Department But to do something in the nature of dirty tricks would be a very very serious problemTrumps running mate Indiana Gov Mike_Pence issued a statement minutes after Trumps remarks that hewed closely to established GOP orthodoxy Instead of baiting the Russians to reveal Clintons emails Pence said that the FBI must get to the bottom of who is behind the hackingIf it is Russia and they are interfering in our elections I can assure you both parties and the United_States government will ensure there are serious consequences the statement continuedIt was unclear_whether Trumps declaration would hurt or help him politically Such comments by a normal candidate in a normal election year would be a seminal and possibly fatal episode Yet neither Trump nor this year are typical and as with past controversies voters may not take Trumps commentary seriouslyPartisan figures rallied immediately to Trumps defense blaming the mainstream media for blowing Trumps comments out of proportion and trying to shift the focus from Clintons judgmentWhats irresponsible is that more_than 30000 emails were deleted by a crook who broke the law former House speaker Newt_Gingrich (R-Ga) said in an_interview I dont care if its the Bulgarians the Chinese or Haitian immigrants studying at Stanford Lets see the 30000 emailsVeteran GOP strategist Mike Murphy said many longtime Republicans were appalled by Trumps gambitThis is what happens when you nominate an egomaniacal bozo as your candidate for president of the United_States Murphy said He has jumped the shark into complete embarrassmentOn the convention stage here this week Clintons supporters have tried to cast Trump as a pawn in Russias global ambitionsReacting to Trumps Wednesday comments former defense secretary Leon E Panetta said As someone who was responsible for protecting our nation from cyberattacks its inconceivable to me that any presidential_candidate would be that irresponsibleRetired admiral John Hutson was more pointed This morning he personally invited Russia to hack us Thats not law and order thats criminal intent Trump has repeatedly tried to do business in Russia and Russian investors have been important to his real_estate empire particularly in recent yearsAccording to litigation filed in Florida Trumps partners on a Panama project traveled to Moscow in 2006 to sell condos to Russian investors Trump also sold a mansion in Palm_Beach in 2008 for $95million to Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev he had purchased the home at a bankruptcy auction four years earlier for $414millionTrump has also sought to build a tower in Moscow numerous times since the late 1980s when he said he had a deal to explore a Trump project in partnership with the Soviet government His most recent effort came after a Putin ally Aras_Agalarov known as the Trump of Russia paid Trump millions to bring the Miss_Universe pageant to Moscow in 2013 Agalarov has told The Washington_Post that he signed a preliminary deal to bring a Trump project to the Russian capitalWe will be in Moscow at some point Trump

himself with aides with ties to Russia in addition to Manafort One of his foreign_policy advisers Carter_Page once ran the Moscow office of Merrill_Lynch and has advised Russian oil giant Gazprom Page

at a 2015 dinner in Moscow honoring RT an English-language media service aligned with the KremlinAt his news_conference Wednesday Trump imagined his presidency ushering in an era of good relations with RussiaI would treat Vladimir_Putin firmly but theres nothing that I can think of that Id rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right_now so that we can go and knock out ISIS together with other people and with other countries Trump said Wouldnt it be nice if we actually got along with people DelReal reported from Milwaukee Rosalind_S Helderman in Washington and Tom_Hamburger and Anne Gearan in Philadelphia contributed to this_reportThe Justice_Department appointed a special_counsel Wednesday to investigate possible_coordination between President Trumps associates and Russian officials a clear signal to the White_House that federal investigators will aggressively pursue the matter despite the presidents insistence that there was no collusion with the KremlinRobert S_Mueller III a former prosecutor who served as the FBI_director from 2001 to 2013 has agreed to take over the investigation as a special_counsel Deputy_Attorney General_Rod J_Rosenstein announced The move marks a concession by the Trump administration to Democratic demands for the investigation to be run independently of the Justice_Department Calls for a special_counsel intensified after last_week In my capacity as acting_attorney general I determined that it is in the public interest for me to exercise my authority and appoint a special_counsel to assume responsibility for this matter Rosenstein said in a statement My decision is not a finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted I have made no such determination What I have determined is that based upon the unique circumstances the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of commandMueller often described by those who worked for him as a stern and press-averse disciplinarian issued a characteristically terse statement I accept this responsibility and will discharge it to the best of my abilityTrump reacted to the news by saying a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know there was no collusion_between my campaign and any foreign entity I look_forward to this matter concluding quickly In the meantime I will never stop fighting for the people and the issues that matter most to the future of our countryIn a series of tweets early Thursday Trump decried that a special_counsel was not named to investigate what he alleged were illegal acts by the Obama_administration and the campaign of Hillary_Clinton With all of the illegal acts that took_place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration there was never a special councel appointed Trump wrote misspelling the word counselLess than 15 minutes later he tweeted This is the single greatest witch_hunt of a politician in American historyThe White_House did_not learn of Rosensteins decision until just 30 minutes before the public announcement was made Rosenstein called White_House Counsel Donald McGahn at 530 pm to inform him at which point McGahn walked downstairs from his second-floor office to the Oval_Office to notify TrumpTrump summoned his senior staff to the Oval_Office and together they drafted a statement reacting to the decision coming from the president that was distributed to reporters shortly_after 7 pm One senior White_House official who was present for the discussions described Trump as unbelievably calm and measuredI expected him to be ranting and raving but he was like Fine let them do what they have to do but well be focused on our agenda said this official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private talks Democrats cheered the announcement as a step forward in resolving the unanswered questions about Russian_meddling in last years presidential_election and whether the president or anyone at the White_House has interfered with the investigation Sen_Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn) said Mueller has the expertise and experience guts and backbone to uncover the truth He said Mueller must be given all the resources necessary to pursue the facts wherever they lead including whether anyone may have tried to obstruct justiceRep Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee cheered the choice writing on Twitter Impeccable credentials Should be widely acceptedBut some Democrats said Muellers appointment does_not preclude the need for an independent commission to examine Russian_interference in the election An independent commission doesnt govern the FBI investigation an independent commission doesnt make charging decisions said Rep Adam_B Schiff_(Calif) the ranking_Democrat on the House_Intelligence Committee which is conducting its own probe of Russian_meddling The value an independent commission adds is you have a body that is truly independent of any political consideration And also has all the resources it needs and a single focus on the oversight of what Russia did how we need to respond in the future and it brings that political independence and staff and resources on task So those are two different needs and I_think theyre complementary not in competition with each otherThe special_counsel law grants Mueller the authority to probe possible attempts to stymie his investigation The decision to appoint a special_counsel comes a day after revelations that recount a conversation with the president in which Trump asked him to drop an investigation_into his former national_security adviser_Michael Flynn Associates of Comey said he took detailed notes of multiple conversations with the president and lawmakers are now demanding access to those memos and any other related records held at the FBI The decision also comes amid intense pressure on the senior official who has been overseeing the Russia probe Rosenstein to appoint a special_counsel Rosenstein was put in charge of the Russia probe after Democrats have challenged Rosensteins impartiality in the Russia probe because he wrote a memorandum initially used as the rationale for Comeys_firing In the memo Rosenstein said Comey had violated long-standing Justice_Department practices in his handling of the investigation_into Clintons use of a private email_server but shortly_after the announcement of the firing the president said he had decided to fire_Comey before he received the recommendation from RosensteinRosenstein is scheduled to brief the full Senate in a closed session on Thursday Former colleagues said Rosensteins move may help restore his battered reputation among current and former government lawyers He got absolutely pummeled by people that he knows said a former senior Obama_administration lawyer who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly I_think this move as so often happens in Washington where there is the opportunity to wash away your sins was a thorough scrubbingUnder the order signed Wednesday by Rosenstein Mueller is tasked with investigating any links and/or coordination_between the Russian_government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump as well as any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation and any other matters that fall under the scope of the Justice_Department regulation covering special_counsel appointmentsIt wasnt immediately clear from the language of the order where Mueller might draw the lines as to which matters are related to the Russia investigationThat language seems to suggest that Mueller could also take over ongoing investigations into leaks of classified_information connected to the Russia probe As the FBI_director Mueller assiduously discouraged leaks by his subordinates and oversaw investigations that sought to criminally charge leakers of government secrets If the special_counsel believes it is necessary and appropriate the special_counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters the order statesAnother potential legal complication could arise from the law_firm where Mueller worked until his appointment as special_counsel That firm WilmerHale has represented who has been under investigation relating to his work and payments for advising Ukrainian government officials Officials referred questions about possible recusals on those subjects to Mueller who didnt respond to requests for commentOfficials said the appointment was being made under a Justice_Department statute that has only been used once in 1999 although the Justice_Department has made other special_counsel appointments more recently under different authority Peter Zeidenberg who has worked for a past special_counsel called Mueller an inspired choice because he comes to the job with automatic credibility among both partiesHes nominally a Republican but hes really not a political person at all said Zeidenberg a lawyer now in private practice who cautioned that such an investigation is likely to take a long time and may not ultimately satisfy the publics demand for a full accounting People are waiting for public answers to what_happened but thats not his job There wont be a report or a news_conference at the end of this from him thats not his role When he was FBI_director Mueller worked closely for a time with Comey who as deputy attorney_general was nominally Muellers boss during the George_W Bush administration and while the two_men agree on much they have very different personalities Mueller was a harsh taskmaster who eschewed expressions of warmth with his staff Comey in contrast has written holiday greetings to staff that have been described as moving The special_counsel gets money and personnel from the Justice_Department but Mueller can ask for specific individuals to join the case WilmerHale lawyers James Quarles and Aaron Zebley also stepped_down from WilmerHale Wednesday and a firm spokesman said they were expected to join Mueller Zebley a former FBI agent and assistant US attorney was Muellers chief of staff at the FBI Quarles was an assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force Given the extremely sensitive nature of the counterintelligence probe it is likely that Mueller will also work with many of the current FBI_agents assigned to the case although the decision is ultimately his to make The budget for the investigation will still have to be approved by RosensteinIn his new role Mueller answers to and in theory could be fired by Rosenstein but in practice a special_counsel is not subject to daily supervision by any Justice_Department official And given that Muellers appointment came about largely because of the firing of the FBI_director it would probably touch off a new political firestorm if Mueller were ever dismissed Philip_Rucker Ellen_Nakashima and Julie_Tate contributed to this reportTwo days after the presidential_election a Russian official speaking to a reporter in Moscow offered a surprising acknowledgment The Kremlin had been in contact with Donald Trumps campaignThe claim coming amid allegations that Russia had interfered with the election was met with an immediate no-wiggle-room blanket denial from Trumps spokeswoman It never happened Hope Hicks at the time There was no communication between the campaign and any foreign entity during the campaignIn fact it is now clear it did happenThe past few_days have brought a growing list of confirmed communications between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials with each new revelation adding to a cloud of suspicion that hangs over the White_House as critics demand an independent investigationTrumps team has offered various explanations for the meetings Some encounters they have said were brief no more_than casual polite introductions Others involved the routine diplomacy common for officials surrounding a candidate for the nations highest officeAttorney General_Jeff Sessions who was an early Trump campaign adviser said with Russian_Ambassador Sergey_Kislyak first reported this week by The Washington_Post came in his role as a senator not as a campaign surrogateIt is unclear why the White_House has consistently denied contacts with Russian officials if the meetings that took_place were innocuous As a result the confirmations of the encounters have trickled out through a series of news stories that have proved increasingly damaging to the Trump administration with some Trump associates appearing to shift their accounts over timeAlready Michael_Flynn was as national_security adviser as a result of his post-election contacts with Kislyak This week the White_House confirmed that those conversations included a brief meeting alongside Trumps_son-in-law and senior adviser Jared_Kushner at Trump_Tower in New_York in December White_House spokeswoman_Sarah Huckabee_Sanders on Friday termed that discussion merely a courtesy meetingSessions has now from oversight of any investigation of Trumps ties to Moscow and is facing calls to step down as a result of his statement during his January confirmation_hearing that he had not had any contacts with the RussiansOn Friday Sanders dismissed the brewing questions The big point here is the president himself knows what his involvement was and thats zero she saidNevertheless the recent revelations have made the post-election comments from the Russian official newly relevant came from Deputy Foreign_Minister Sergei Ryabkov who told the Interfax news_agency in November that there were contacts with Trumps aidesObviously Ryabkov said we know most of the people from his entourageAs the Trump campaign rejected the assertion other Russian officials said any communications would have been routine and offered to Democratic_nominee Hillary_Clintons campaign as well a contention denied at the time by a Clinton aideNearly all of the contacts that have emerged so_far were with Kislyak the affable Russian_ambassador in Washington who is known as a consummate networker Kislyak appears to have worked to cultivate a relationship with the Trump campaign starting his outreach even before Trump was thought likely to win the GOP nominationIn April Kislyak popped up at the Mayflower Hotel where he was seated in the front row at one of Trumps first major foreign_policy addresses During the speech Trump offered a forceful promise that he would seek better relations with RussiaI believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible absolutely possible he saidThe events host Dimitri K Simes president of the Center for the National Interest a foreign_policy think_tank said Kislyak was one of four ambassadors who attended as guests of his group Simes said he introduced Trump and Kislyak in a receiving line at a reception before the event which was also attended by Sessions and Kushner among other Trump aidesSimes who is Russian American and favors warmer relations with Moscow said it is common practice for foreign diplomats to try to get to know important advisers like Sessions to presidential candidates Let_me put it more bluntly They would be derelict in their duty if they didnt try to get to know him Simes saidKislyak was also in attendance at the Republican_National Convention where he briefly after a July 18 Heritage_Foundation event attended by dozens of diplomatsTwo days later Kislyak met with Trump advisers Carter_Page and JD Gordon after a convention-related Global Partners in Diplomacy event at Case Western Reserve UniversityIn an email Gordon said he briefly spoke to Kislyak in a group of diplomats there and also at an evening reception Gordon called it a brief informal conversation during which he repeated public Trump statements about improving relations with RussiaPage also confirmed his interaction with Kislyak at the event to MSNBC on Thursday Last month he told PBS that he had held no meetings with any Russian officials during the campaignThose meetings at the Republican convention came as questions about Trumps stance on Russia started to seriously enter campaign_trail conversationAt the time some GOP delegates were questioning the wording of the party platform and whether the Trump campaign had intervened to make it more Russia friendly A delegates proposal regarding US support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia-backed rebels had been softened before inclusion in the document Then-campaign manager_Paul Manafort who previously was to a pro-Russian Ukrainian president told NBC in August that the change absolutely did_not come from the campaignBut this week Gordon the Trump campaign adviser offered a different explanation He said he had advocated for the change believing it to match Trumps views In an email he said he had consulted about the matter with campaign policy colleagues before arriving in ClevelandPages participation in the July meeting came 13 days after he drew scrutiny for a July 8 speech he delivered in Moscow in which he was critical of US foreign policyPage has denied holding substantive meetings with Russian officials during that trip but told The_Post in September that he briefly met and shook hands with Russian Deputy Prime_Minister Arkady Dvorkovich after his address Page told MSNBC on Thursday that he held no material discussions during the trip Russias alleged interference in the US election exploded as a public issue a few_days after Page and Gordon met with Kislyak On July 22 WikiLeaks posted thousands of emails hacked from the Democratic_National Committee causing recriminations in the party on the eve of its national conventionRather than condemning the possible intervention in the election by a foreign power Trump playfully called on the Russians to hack Clintons private_server and locate emails she had deleted Russia if youre listening I_hope youre able to find the 30000 emails that are missing at a July 27 news conferenceSessions met with Kislyak in his office on Capitol_Hill on Sept8 as US officials were growing more concerned about Russias role in the election He said Thursday that the meeting came in his role as a member of the Senate_Armed Services_Committee noting that it was one of many such meetings he took with diplomatsSanders the White_House spokeswoman told_reporters Friday that suspicions about the meeting were pretty unfair given that Sessionss senatorial duties put him in touch routinely with diplomatsBut a survey by The_Post of all 26 members of the committee showed that Sessions was the only one to meet one-on-one with Kislyak in 2016 And a Polish diplomat in late spring said he did so at Sessionss request at_least in part because of Sessionss role with TrumpI was aware that Sessions was a senator and at the same_time somebody close to Donald Trump I just wanted to hear what he wanted to say any message communication questions said Ryszard Schnepf who was ambassador at the time and has since retired He declined to say what he and Sessions discussed except to say the issues would have been of interest to a senator at the same_time as [a surrogate] for somebody who is running for presidentIn a brief interview last_month Kislyak told The_Post that he had also had communications with Flynn before the election He declined to detail them Its something all diplomats do he said Greg Miller contributed to this reportPresident Trump as director of the FBI citing Comeys_handling of the agencys investigation_into Hillary_Clintons private email serverby deputy attorney_general Rod_J Rosenstein the White_House citedtwo key developments in the investigationThe first was Comeys news_conference on July 5 2016 when he announced that the FBI would not recommend criminal_charges against Clinton for her use of a private email_server as secretary of state Rosenstein wrote in hismemo The Director was wrong to usurp the Attorney Generals authority on July 5 2016 and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution It is not the function of the Director to make such an announcement At most the Director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutorsThe other was a letter Comey wrote to members of Congress on Oct_28 2016 notifying them that the FBI was resuming its email probe Comey defended this decision saying that not disclosing the information would have been to conceal the information Rosenstein challenged Comeys view arguing that quietly opening an investigation is not concealing anything we are simply following the long-standing policy that we refrain from publicizing non-public informationBased on Rosensteins letter in which he said Comeys decisions were indefensible and damaged the credibility and reputation of the agency Attorney_General Jeff_Sessions recommended Trump remove Comey Trump dismissed Comey later that dayThis made us wonder How does the decision by Trump and Sessions in May 2017 comport with their rhetoric about Comeys_handling of the investigationOn July 5 Comey in handling classified material but investigators did_not find intentional mishandling of classified informationThen-Attorney General Loretta E Lynch had said amid criticisms of her private meeting with Bill_Clinton while the investigation was still underwayThat evening Trump said he was surprised by Comeys recommendation saying he believed Clinton had criminal intent He implied the former president influenced the investigation by meeting with Lynch But when asked whether hed fire Lynch and Comey Trump didnt give a definitive answer Trump repeatedly criticized Lynch and Comey but not for the reasons hed use to fire_Comey 10 months later Instead Trump thought Comey should have brought criminal_charges against Clinton tweeting it was a #RiggedSystemNeither was Sessions immediately critical of Comeys decision to make the announcement separate from Lynch He said it was a difficult case From his July 7 2016 interview on Fox_News with Greta Van Susteren Two weeks later Sessions still didnt criticize Comey for acting out of line From his July 20 2016 interview on Fox_News Trump and Clinton officially became their parties presidential nominees by August 2016 Sessions was one of Trumps most active surrogates slamming Clinton over her use of a private_server and contributions to the Clinton FoundationDuring a CNN interview on Aug 23 2016 Sessions would not answer whether he trusted Comeys conclusions in the email investigation Trump continued to complain about Comey but again not for the reason hed use later to fire_Comey During an Oct 13 2016 rally in West Palm_Beach Fla Trump claimed FBI employees are embarrassed and ashamed of what Comey had done because he wasnt harsh enough on Clinton Then on Oct_28 informing them that the agency found new information relating to the Clinton email case and needed to assess whether they are relevantThis time Trump and Sessions agreed with Comeys decision Seven months later both men would blame Comey for this decision and use it to justify his dismissalHowever in that same Lou Dobbs Tonight interview Sessions said it was the attorney_generals job to decide whether or not to prosecute not Comeys This is consistent with his view in May 2017 Two days before the Nov 8 election Sessions again said Comey did the right thing by disclosing new evidence But he again said the attorney_general should have been the one to make the final call However in this case a special prosecutor would be necessary because of Lynchs meeting with Bill_Clinton Sessions said in a Nov 6 2016 interview on Fox_News (The day before Sessions Rudolph W Giuliani and Frank Keating about this)As president-elect Trump equivocated on whether he would fire_Comey From his Nov 13 2016 interview on 60 Minutes After that Trump sent mixed signals about Comey in interviews and on Twitter Heres a sampling of his various statements (Our colleague Jenna Johnson chronicled )For example heres an April 12 2017 interview with Fox Business Networks Maria Bartiromo But then Trump changed his mind by May 2 2017 when he (An issued by the White_House suggests Trump was strongly inclined to remove him after watching Comeys testimony on May 3)Exactly one week later Trump fired ComeyTo justify Comeys_firing the administration cited two reasons Comey shouldnt have announced on July 5 that the Clinton investigation should be closed without prosecution and he didnt necessarily need to disclose on Oct_28 about the new development in the caseTrump and Sessions both criticized the outcome of the investigation announced on July 5 but did_not immediately criticize him for usurping Lynchs authority as they did in May 2017 However Sessions ultimately did criticize the chain of command in the process Theres_no clear flip-flop by both menAs for Comeys Oct_28 decision both Trump and Sessions defended it in the following days But as president-elect and into his presidency Trump remained skeptical of Comeys judgment throughoutthe Clinton probe By May 2017 the two_men found Comeys Oct_28 letter no_longer necessary This is inconsistent with the times they defended Comey for the letterWhile there are inconsistencies in both mens rhetoric compared with their decisions on May 2017 both have remained skeptical of Comeys judgment and role throughout the process So this does_not quite amount to a flip-flop meriting an Upside-Down Pinocchio In the absence of a rating such as atPolitiFact we will not rate this claim()President Trump and his surrogates are attacking the judgment and independence of former FBI_director Robert_S Mueller_III the special_counsel overseeing the Russia investigation and related matters They are criticizing the political_contributions of some of the attorneys hired to Muellers_team questioning the investigators independenceTrump claimedthe attorneys are all supporters of Hillary_Clinton and worked for her The ad described the hires as a part of a rigged gameLets dig into itThe attacks aimed_at discrediting Mueller one month into his special investigation are similar to efforts by former president Bill_Clintons supporterstwo decades ago Democrats at the timeKenneth Starr special_counsel whose investigations ultimately led to Clintons impeachment in the House They painted Starr as an unethical investigator with a conflict of interest conducting a Mueller has hired 13 attorneys and is expected to hire more Most are veteran attorneys at the Justice_Department or the FBI or attorneys Mueller worked with at the WilmerHale law_firm which he left in May when The members Four (Quarles Weissmann Rhee Prelogar) have made political_contributions to Democrats and four (Zebley Dreeben Page Jed) have no record of making political_contributions Previous news reports incorrectly identified Dreeben as a Democratic donor mistaking him for a furniture designer in Chicago named Michael W DreebenQuarles gave the most political donations out of the four nearly$33000 to various Democrats since 1999 Federal Election Commission records_show Recipients included Obama for America Hillary for America and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign CommitteeQuarles is the only one who donated to Republicans In 2005 he gave $250 to then-Sen George Allen of VirginiaIn 2015 he gave $2500 to Jason Chaffetz the Utah Republican and chairman of the House Oversight Committee who later wouldinvestigate Hillary_Clintons private email_server useWeissmann donated $4300 total to the Obama Victory_Fund in 2008 $2300 to the Clinton campaign in 2007 and the Democratic_National Committee in 2006 Rhee gave $5400 total to Hillary for America in 2015 and 2016 $4800 total in 2008 and 2011 to the Obama Victory_Fund and $250 to the DNCin 2004 (Quarles and Rhee gave maximum contributions of $2700 to Clintons 2016_presidential campaign)Prelogar donated $500 total to Obama Victory fund in 2012 and Hillary for America in 2016 (Note We corrected an error in the calculation for Rhees donations to the Obama Victory Fund)Rhee was a partner on the defense team in a lawsuit over Clintons use of her private email_server Zebley once represented a Clinton aide at WilmerHale So Trump twisted the facts Not all of Muellers hires supported Clinton and none of them worked for Clinton directlyThe White_House did_not provide an explanation of Trumps claimA Great America Alliance spokesman said the ads message is that hiring four high-profile attorneys who contributed to Democrats means Mueller cannot credibly claim to conduct an investigation without some inherent bias or conflictAn independent investigation should actually be independent and Mr Mueller is failing to achieve that standard the spokesman said Stacking the investigative team with political opponents of the president will not achieve an unbiased result and we are committed to exposing this realityBut that overlooks important context the Justice_Department from considering the political affiliation or political_contributions of career appointees including those appointed to the Special_Counsels Office So the implication that Mueller is making politically motivated hires is quite a stretch as he is legally prohibited from considering their political affiliationsUnder the Rules of Professional Responsibility attorneys are permitted to participate in matters involving their former firms clients so long as they have no confidential information about the client and did_not participate in the representation said Peter Carr spokesman for the Special_Counsels Office Moreoverattorneys are bound by confidentiality rules and may not useinformation they learned from one client (say Clinton Foundation) and divulge it in another case (say the Russia probe)The Justice_Departments ethics_experts found Mueller and those he hired from his former firm are consistent with DOJ rules Carr said This was despite concerns over WilmerHales representation of Trumps former campaign_manager Paul_Manafort son-in-law_Jared Kushner and daughter_Ivanka TrumpThat Rhee represented the Clinton_Foundation is irrelevant said Stephen Gillers expert in legal ethics at the New_York University School of LawThe Mueller investigation is not about Clintons emails The two matters are apples and oranges A lawyer could work on bothIn fact the lead defense attorney that Rhee worked with on the Clinton_Foundation case now represents Kushner and Ivanka TrumpTrump mischaracterized the donations from Muellers attorneys and falsely claimed some even worked for Hillary_Clinton Four out of eight attorneys made public so_far have contributed to Democrats including Clinton and Obama The other four have no record of political contributionsOne attorney who donatedthe maximum amount to Clintons 2016_presidential campaign represented the Clinton_Foundation in a 2015 lawsuit Another attorney who made no political donations represented a Clinton aide at one point Both attorneys worked for WilmerHale a firm that also represents Trumps former campaign_manager daughter and son-in-lawFurther Trump and the ad use these political_contributions to suggestbias orconflict of interest But that twists the facts that misleads the public to believe there is something nefarious going on Legally and under federal ethics rules there is no conflict of interest The DOJ is legally barred from discriminating career appointees based on political affiliation so Mueller cant decide his team based on their contributions That half of the publicly named special_counsel attorneys donated to Democrats is not an indication that Mueller has failed to achieve a standard of independence We award Three Pinocchios()Do you rate this claim as true or false More Pinocchios for false fewer based on your opinion of the statements truthfulness (The_check mark_means you think the statement is true not that you agree with the rating)We_need to verify that you are an actual_person This is a non-scientific_user poll_Results are not statistically_valid and cannot be assumed to reflect the views of Washington_Post users as a group or the general populationDonald Trump just walked into another political and foreign_policy minefield of his own makingTrump saidWednesday that he hopes a country that just happens to be one of the United_States most antagonistic fellow world powers Russia has or would obtain unreleased emails from Hillary_Clintons tenure as secretary of stateThey probably have her 33000 emails too I_hope they do he said adding later Russia if youre listening I_hope youre able to find the 30000 emails that are missing I_think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our pressThere are many many potential problems with this scenario and not just for Clintons campaign but also for US national_security Indeedthe logical extension of his comments is that a foreign power would be deciding how to handle possiblysensitive information about a potential US presidentAnd none other than Trump himself has suggested this kind of information could be First a little background Trump here is referring to approximately half of on the private_server that Clinton used as secretary of state and thatwere deleted because they were deemed personal and not turned over to State_Department investigators Republicans have cried foul over their deletionTrump seemed to imply later Wednesday in a tweet that he simply wanted the emails to be turned over to the FBI no matter who might obtain themIf Russia or any other country or person has Hillary_Clintons 33000 illegally deleted emails perhaps they should share them with the FBI Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) But Trumps comments earlier Wednesday suggested Russia might hand the emails over to the news media as WikiLeaks did with hacked Democratic_National Committee emails last_week As it did with the committee except this time for a former top USdiplomat who could soon be presidentAnd hehas said previously in this campaign without any evidence that enemies of the United_States almost certainly haveaccessed Clintons emails and So hes clearly aware of that possibilityFBI Director_James B_Comey said in rebuking Clintons use of the email_server earlier_this month that but that there was no_evidence yet that it had happenedGiven that combination of factors we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clintons personal email account he saidTrumps aimhere seems to be highlighting that Clinton deleted her emails full stop If Russia can find them after all maybe they will come to light he seems to suggestBut that scenario could also very plausibly lend itself to the kind of cyberespionage blackmail or otherwise that Trump has already alleged Clinton is being subjected toThe emails were deemed personal and should not contain classified_information Yes but many work-related emails Clinton said did_not contain classified_information were later proven by the FBI to have contained some And even if the information is all personal in nature that could be used against Clinton tooTrump literally just invited ad encouraged Russia to commit cyberespionage on his political rival Simon Maloy (@SimonMaloy) How is calling for a cyberattack from a foreign power anything but treasonous Douglas Heye (@DougHeye) Trump of course has gone far outside the mainstream on foreign_policy before He has basically said he might unilaterally pull the United_States out of its obligation to defend other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) when they are attacked if they dont foot more of the bill for the organizationWere talking_about countries that are doing very well he Then yes I would be absolutely prepared to tell those countries Congratulations you will be defending yourselfThe comment earned stern rebukes from all sides of the USforeign-policy debate and foreign leaders The message it sends to allies experts said is that the United_States which would be a major problem for the United_States standing in the world and for maintaining and buildingrelationships with alliesSo Trump is clearly not abiding by the standard protocol of USofficials who talkcarefully about foreign policyBut Wednesdays comments ratchet things up even more Even as he contended that hes not the preferred candidate of Russia as hes now hoping Russia has potentially damaging_information about a possible US presidentThats stunningAnd while Trump did_not say he wants Russia to use those emails for blackmail or espionage purposes his previous comments make clear its a possibility hes very well aware ofDonald Trump outlined an unabashedly noninterventionist approach to world affairs Monday telling The Washington_Posts editorial board that he questions the need for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization which has formed the backbone of Western security policies since the Cold WarThe meeting at The_Post covered a range of issues including media libel laws violence at his rallies climate_change NATO and the US presence in AsiaSpeaking ahead of a major address on foreign_policy later Monday in front of the American Israel Public_Affairs Committee Trump said he advocates a light footprint in the worldIn spite of unrest abroad especially in the Middle_East Trump said the United_States must look inward and steer its resources toward rebuilding domestic infrastructure I do think its a different world today and I dont_think we should be nation-building anymore Trump said I_think its proven not to work and we have a different country than we did then We have $19 trillion in debt Were sitting probably on a bubble And its a bubble that if it breaks its going to be very nasty I just think we have to rebuild our countryHe added I watched as we built schools in Iraq and theyre blown up We build another one we get blown up We rebuild it three_times and yet we cant build a school in Brooklyn We have no money for education because we cant build in our own country At what point do you say Hey we have to take care of ourselves So I know the outer world exists and Ill be very cognizant of that But at the same_time our_country is disintegrating large sections of it especially the inner citiesFor the first time Trump also listed members of a team chaired by Sen_Jeff Sessions_(R-Ala) that is counseling him on foreign affairs and helping to shape his policies Keith Kellogg Carter_Page George_Papadopoulos Walid Phares and Joseph E SchmitzTrump praised George P Shultz who served as President Ronald Reagans top diplomat and was harshly critical of current secretary of state John_F Kerry He questioned the United_States continued involvement in NATO and on the subject of Russias aggression in Ukraine said Americas alliesare not doing anythingUkraine is a country that affects us far_less than it affects other countries in NATO and yet were doing all of the lifting Trump said Theyre not doing anything And I say Why is it that Germanys not dealing with NATO on Ukraine Why is it that other countries that are in the vicinity of Ukraine why arent they dealing Why are we always the one thats leading potentially the third world war with Russia Trump said thatUS involvement in NATO may need to be significantly diminished in the coming years breaking with nearly seven decades of consensus in Washington We certainly cant afford to do this anymore Trumpsaid adding later NATO is costing us a fortune and yes were protecting Europe with NATO but were spending a lot of moneyTrump sounded a similar note in discussing the US presence in the Pacific He questioned the value of massive military investments in Asia and wondered aloud whether the United_States still was capable of being an effective peacekeeping force thereSouth Korea is very rich great industrial country and yet were not reimbursed fairly for what we do Trump said Were constantly sending our ships sending our planes doing our war games were reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costingAsked whether the United_States benefitsfrom its involvement in the region Trump replied Personally I dont_think so He added I_think we were a very powerful very wealthy country and we are a poor country now Were a debtor nationTrump cast China as a leading economic and geopolitical rival and said the United_States should toughen its trade alliances to better competeChina has got unbelievable ambitions Trump said China feels very invincible We have rebuilt China They have drained so much money out of our_country that theyve rebuilt China Without us you wouldnt see the airports and the roadways and the bridges The George Washington Bridge [in New York] thats like a trinket compared to the bridges that they build in China We dont build anymore We had our dayTrump began the hour-long meeting by pulling out a list of some of his foreign_policy advisersWalid Phares who you probably knowPhD adviser to the House of Representatives Hes a counterterrorism expert Trump said Carter_Page PhD George_Papadopoulos Hes an oil and energy consultant Excellent guy The honorable Joe Schmitz [was] inspector general at the Department of Defense General Keith Kellogg And I have quite a few more But thats a group of some of the people that we are dealing with We have many other people in different aspects of what we do But thats a pretty representative groupTrump said he plans to share more names in the coming days a former Army lieutenant general is anexecutive

recording was sharedby the editorial board and a full transcript will be posted later MondayTrump was accompanied to the meeting which took_place at The Posts new headquarters by his campaign_manager Corey_Lewandowski and spokeswoman Hope HicksA US-based employee of a Russian real_estate company took part in a June_2016 Trump_Tower meeting between a Russian lawyer and Donald Trump Jr bringing to eight the number of known participants at the session that has emerged as a key focus of the investigation of the Trump campaigns interactions with RussiansIke Kaveladze attended the meeting as a representative of Aras and Emin_Agalarov the father-and-son Russian developers who hosted the Trump-owned Miss_Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013 according to Scott Balber an attorney for the Agalarovs who said he also represents KaveladzeBalber said Tuesday that he had received a phone_call over the weekend from a representative of special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III asking whether Kaveladze would agree to be interviewed Balber said his client would cooperateThe request is the first public indication that Muellers_team is investigating the meetingThe presence of Kaveladze at the Trump_Tower meeting introduces a new and intriguing figure into the increasingly complex Trump-Russia drama A native of the Soviet republic of Georgia who came to the United_States in 1991 Kaveladze was the subject nearly two_decades ago of a congressional inquiry into Russian money_laundering in US banks although he was never charged with a crime and Balber said there was never any sign of wrongdoing by KaveladzeThe emergence of new information on Tuesday some 10days after the Trump_Tower meeting was first reported underscored how details of the session have been slow to emerge amid incomplete and potentially misleading explanations from Trump JrAfter the New_York Times first reported the meeting Trump Jr said only that the lawyer had primarily discussed the adoption of Russian children by AmericansMore information about the meeting and its participants has emerged since July11 when Trump Jr said he wished to be transparent and released emails dating to June_2016 between himself and Rob Goldstone a music promoter who represented Emin_Agalarov a Russian pop singer setting_up the meeting Those emails revealed that on the promise that he would be provided damaging_information about Democratic candidate Hillary_Clinton as part of a Russian_government effort to help his fathers presidential campaign according to emails released by Trump Jr last weekTrump Jrs acknowledgment of the meeting undercut months of denials from top Trump aides that campaign officials had any contact with Russians before the November electionThe meeting brought together then-candidate Donald Trumps innermost circle including son-in-law_Jared Kushner and top campaign adviser Paul_Manafort as well as a Russian and Russian Americans with deep ties to Trumps business and the priorities of the Russian_government Goldstone the music promoter told The Washington_Post that he also attendedThe Russian lawyer was leading an effort to get Congress to lift sanctions_imposed in 2012 to punish Russia for human_rights abuses a topic of deep importance to the Russian_government Angered over the law called the Magnitsky_Act Russia had put a hold on adoptions of children by US familiesAlso present at the meeting was Rinat Akhmetshin a Soviet army veteran whose military service in the 1980s came in a unit whose responsibilities included counterintelligence Now a Russian American lobbyist he has earned a reputation as a savvy political operator at times boosting the reputation of his clients by sullying the reputations of their enemies He has denied working for the Russian_government or intelligence servicesKaveladze came to the meeting as a representative of the Agalarov family business associates of Donald Trump who were also a key tie between the Trump family and Russia in the years before Trump began his campaignTrump and Aras_Agalarov had discussed building a Trump_Tower in Moscow but plans fizzled after Western sanctions were imposed in 2014 and the Russian economy tanked the elder Agalarov told The_Post last yearAlan Futerfas Trump Jrs attorney did_not respond to requests for comment Tuesday about the presence of Kaveladze nor did a spokesman for Kushner An attorney for Manafort declined to commentKaveladze works as a vice_president focusing on real_estate and finance for the Agalarovs company the Crocus Group Balber saidBalber said that Aras_Agalarov asked Kaveladze to attend on his behalf Kaveladze is a US citizen and has lived in this country for many years according to BalberBalber said Kaveladze believed he would act as a translator but arrived to discover that had brought her own translator a former State_Department employee named Anatoli Samochornov Samochornov declined to comment citing a nondisclosure agreement he signed as a professional translatorBalber said that he thinks eight people attended the meeting and that the names of all the participants are now known to the public Balber said Kaveladze recalls the meeting lasted about 30minutes and mostly involved discussion of the 2012 sanctions law In attending the meeting Kaveladze brought a history of controversyIn 2000 his actions as the head of a Delaware company called International Business Creations were the subject of a congressional investigation of how Russians and other foreigners were able to launder large amounts of money through US banksThe Government Accountability Office report which had been requested by then-Sen Carl Levin (D-Mich) concluded that it was relatively easy for these foreigners to use shell companies to open US bank_accounts and route hidden money through the American financial systemThe report described the activities of IBCs president who Balber confirmed was KaveladzeBalber said Kaveladze was not charged with any crime as a result of the inquiry which he said was largely focused on the internal procedures of US banksThere has never been any indication that he did anything wrong Balber said From his perspective it was a big nothingBut Levin who at the time was the senior Democrat on a Senate investigations subcommittee and retired in 2014 issued a statement Tuesday calling Kaveladze a poster child of the practice of using shell companies to launder funds and that the inquiry helped spark reformsKaveladzes conduct helped us reinvigorate the requirement that banks know the true owner of their accounts a policy that hadnt been enforced over the years Levin saidBalber called Levins comments outrageous the reality is that what my client did was unequivocally and undeniably legalAccording to the GAO Kaveladze opened 236 bank_accounts in the United_States for corporations formed in Delaware on behalf of mostly Russian brokers The GAO report said that Kaveladze had told officers of two US banks that he had conducted investigations of the Russian companies for which he opened accountsHe admitted to us that he made such representations to the banks but that he in fact had not investigated the companies the report said Balber objected to this part of the report saying I take issue with this adding that his client did_not make such a statement to the GAOAll told the report traced the movement of $14billion in wire-transfer transactions deposited into 236 accounts opened at the two banks Citibank and Commercial BankWhat exactly was discussed at the 2016 Trump_Tower meeting remains unclearAkhmetshin told The_Post that Veselnitskaya spent a portion of the meeting describing a great campaign issue for the Trumps allegations of Russian tax improprieties by a US venture capital firm whose executives were political donors Akhmetshin said that Veselnitskaya left behind a document with the Trump associates describing the allegations It was corporate stuff lawyerly stuff Akhmetshin saidThe venture capital firm Ziff Brothers Investments had a financial stake in Hermitage Capital whose chief_executive became the leading global advocate of the Magnitsky_Act which was named for a former Hermitage auditor who died in a Russian jail under suspicious circumstancesA spokesman for Ziff Brothers Investments Michael Freitag declined to commentTrump Jr has said Veselnitskayas information was vague and made no sense and he decided the offer of damaging_information about Democrats was a pretense to secure the meeting to discuss sanctions Julie_Tate contributed to this reportThere have been twists and turnsover the past_year of President Trumps alleged ties to Russia and Russian influence on the 2016_presidential election to help Trump winYet one thing has remained consistent Trump blames the Democrats not the RussiansTrump says the latest reports of ties_between his staff and Russians are the Democrats attempt to undermine his presidency But a look at his comments over the past_year shows Trump used the same explanation for every new development in stories involving Russia the election and his staffIn this timeline we took a look at all the developments in the Trump-Russia controversy that Trump has blamed on Democrats We will update the timeline as necessaryJames R_Clapper Jr then the director of national intelligencesaid his agency of attempted cyberattacks on the campaigns He did_not say whether the attempted attacks were successful whether foreign or domestic hackers were behind the attacks or which campaign networks were targeted DNC officials and concluded that Russian_government hackers breached the committees computer network gaining access to its database of opposition_research on Trump and all email and chat traffic Russia A hacker identifying only as Guccifer 20 Yet that day Trump said the DNC hacked itselfWikiLeaks from the DNC database Trump then the GOP presidential_nominee to obtainClintons private emails that had been deletedTrump later said he was joking He rejected allegations that Russians targeted DNC or that the Russians were attempting to help Trump get elected He blamed Democrats for fabricating Russian ties to Trump because they were embarrassed about WikiLeaks even_though the previous month he said the DNC hacked itselfFunny how the failing is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said Trump is a genius America 1st Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump Crazy Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) As the GOP presidential_nominee Trump began receiving intelligence briefings this month Trump reportedly was briefed on cybersecurity and the Russian governments attempts to interfere in the elections Over the next three months Trump repeatedly denied Russian involvement blamed the hacks on Democrats and praised WikiLeaks Trumps interview with Larry King a state-funded Russian television network Trump said it was pretty unlikely that Russians were disrupting the elections which he deemed an inappropriate act In the Trump refused to blame RussiaUS intelligence_agencies saying they were confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from US persons and institutions including from US political organizations In the Trump again refused to blame Russia In the Trump again refused to blame Russia When pressed Trump generally condemned the concept of foreign influence on the election The CIA concluded that Russia intervened in the presidential_election to help Trump win the presidency President-elect Trump called The Posts report ridiculous and an excuse made up by Democrats Trump tweeted this even_though the hacking was brought up throughout the electionUnless you catch hackers in the act it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking Why wasnt this brought up before election Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Trump said Americans should move on from Russia allegations and from the Obama_administrations plans to impose sanctions on Russia for alleged interference The US Intelligence Community concluding that Russians influenced the election in an effort help Trump get elected Obama and Trump are briefed on this report CNN and BuzzFeed

about a terrorist attack that left four American soldiers deadAnd even then it was only because a reporter asked Why havent we heard anything from you so_far about the soldiers that were killed in NigerTrumps answer that he likes to call and write letters to family members of slain service membersunlike his predecessors kicked off days of strange volleys between the president and the media Aides of former presidents quickly rejected the notion thattheir bosses did_not communicate with families who had lost loved ones Reporters contacted Gold Star families and found that Trumps record of reaching_out was at best spottyOn Tuesday RepFrederica S Wilson (D-Fla) said that Trumps call to the widow of Sgt La_David T Johnson was so insensitive it left her in tearsBut beyond thatcontroversy theres a lot we still dont_know about what_happened in Niger and why four American soldiers died there Republicans and Democrats are calling for an investigation andWilson Mr Trumps BenghaziHeres what we do knowUS troops to help the French military which was running an operation against al-Qaeda in Mali Then-President Barack_Obama sent 150 service_members to Nigers capital Niamey to set_up a surveillance drone operation over Mali Today there are about 800 soldiers assisting in the fight against al-Qaeda the Islamic_State and Boko Haram the Nigerian extremist militant group Many have been tasked with setting_up a drone base in the countrys northern desert or running surveillance missions out of Niamey According to ABC News fewer than 100 Green Berets are in Niger to help build the capacity of its military Those troops can instruct their counterparts on skills from basic marksmanship to small-team maneuvering and calling in close air supportBut clearly the mission can turn dangerous and resemble something like combatIts unclear but we know that a group of eight to 12 USsoldierswas accompanying 30 to 40 Nigerien troops on some kind of mission near Tongo Tongo (Other accounts suggest that onlyeight to 12 Nigerien and American soldiers actually entered the village and that the other Nigerien troops were stationed nearby) The group met with leaders and collected supplies As they were heading home they were ambushed by about 50 militantsThere was a firefight the assailantsblew up their vehiclesThesoldiers ran for cover and began returning fireApparently a French military aircraft was on the scene within 30 minutes but it didnt fire on the attackers (There are different accounts as towhy Reuters reported that the fighting was happening at close quarters so theFrench aircraft couldnt intervene Others have said that Niger forbids airstrikes on its soil) based on military interviews with the survivors shared with the network by a US defense official some of the soldierssaid it seemed like the local leaders were delaying thesoldiers departure which caused them to suspect that the villagers may have been complicit in the ambushBut by the end of the fight four Americans were dead The remains of three Staff Sgts Bryan Black Jeremiah Johnson and Dustin Wright were retrieved It took 48 hours to recoverthe body of Sgt La_David Johnson who had been separated from the rest of the groupThere was also some initial disagreement about who flew the medevac helicopter to rescue the wounded and retrieve the deadThe Washington_Post confirmed that contractorBerry Aviation conducted the casualty evacuation and transportAccording to the Pentagon the answer is yes Defense_Department officials said that soldiers had carried_out 29 similar operations in the past six_months with no problems By this time they were considered routineBut critics wonder whether enough precautions were taken The troops were armed only with rifles and traveled in unarmored pickup trucks There was no US drone flying overhead to track the soldiers French officials told Reuters they felt the US military acted without enough intelligenceor contingency planningThe Defense Intelligence_Agency has said it believes the Islamic_State in the Greater Sahara was behind the attack The group has been around at_least since 2015 when its leader split from al-Qaeda According to US officials this isnt an officially recognized branch of the Islamic_State oneAmerican official called it a wannabe In the past the group has attacked French counterterrorism forces but it hasnever before launched an attack on US forces ( Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen from his home in Abalak Niger in 2016 Woodkey is still being held with five other hostages)The men were carrying small arms machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades The Pentagon said they were well-equipped and trained Investigations are underway The Defense_Department is conducting a review of what went wrong and the Pentagons Africa Command has sent a team of investigators to Niger (We need to collect some basic facts a Defense_Department official ) The French military is also looking into it The Senate_Armed Services_Committee has called on the Trump administration to lay out a fuller explanation of what went wrongI think the administration has to be more clear about our role in Niger and our role in other areas in Africa and other parts of the globe Sen Jack Reed(D-RI) They have to connect it to a strategy They should do that I_think that the inattention to this issue is not acceptableSen John_McCain (R-Ariz) has been more blunt When asked by a reporter whether he thought the Trump administration was being upfront about what_happened in Niger he replied simplyThe special_counsel overseeing the investigation_into Russian_interference in the 2016 elections including whether President Trump obstructed justice when firing James_B Comey as FBI_director Nowwith every new development Trumps critics are quick to call for his impeachment and label his actions as obstruction of justiceYet this is not a simple process and many times such reactions are exaggerated Its still early in the investigation with no_indication yet whether any findings could lead to potential chargesIts important to consider the full context and nuances in the face of heated rhetoric on this topic We explored some key questions below and provided links to other helpful expert analysesThis is one of those termsthat are used frequently It generally refers to actions taken to impede an official investigation Obstruction of justice is a felony offenseThere are several federal statutes that include relevant language that could qualify someones actions as obstruction of justiceUnder a person has committed a federal offense when they corruptly or by threats or force or by any threatening letter or communication influences obstructs or impedes or endeavors to influence obstruct or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United_States or the due and proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry or investigation in being had by either House or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the CongressThe key word here is corruptly that under federal statutes corruptly is defined as acting with an improper purpose personally or by influencing another including making a false or misleading statement or withholding concealing altering or destroying a document or other informationThis means that in obstruction of justice cases its not enough evidence to show someone intended to impede an investigation There needs to be evidence that the person impeded that they knew it was wrong but did it anyway with corrupt intent Its about the mental state of the personThats a high bar and corrupt intent is not a black-and-white matter In the absence of conclusive findings by the special_counsel there are many unanswered questions about whether what we know so_far could build an obstruction of justice case Based on the facts available so_far publicly there is not yet a case for obstruction of justice said Kenneth Starr the special_counsel who investigated President Bill_Clinton Obstruction of justice is really a very hard crime to make out Its not just you want the investigation to go away you suggest the investigation goes away Starr said Youve got to take really affirmative action And you know what thats a good thing for all of us Crime should be difficult to proveFor more check out by LawfareIn the 1974 case the Supreme_Court recognized that the president has constitutional authority to exercise executive privilege which protects compelled disclosure to other branches of governmentA recent example President_Barack Obama invoked executive privilege when blocking Attorney_General Eric Holder from releasing documents in Operation Fast and Furious As a result a in 2012 to hold Holder in contempt and a federal_judge rejected Obamas privilegeExecutive privilege applies narrowly and it can only be used in certain circumstances such as protecting confidential or sensitive communications or matters of national_security Basically the president canhave private frank conversations with his advisers to carry out his duty as president in an informed way This privilege doesnt apply tomatters of political expediencyThis continues to come up in news coverage as former and current federal officials are being called to testify in public hearings about matters they discussed with the president For_example before Comeys June testimony before the Senate_Intelligence Committee there were questions as to whether Trump could invoke executive privilege to block Comey from testifying Of_course at the time Comey was a private citizen after being fired from his job by Trump so Comey even if Trump did assert this authorityReaders asked us to fact-check whether Attorney_General Jeff_Sessions correctly referenced executive privilege when refusing to answer certain questions about Comey and the Russia investigation during a Senate_Intelligence Committee hearing in June The Justice_Department cited Reagan-era memos about executive_branch officials declining to answer_questions at a congressional hearing about confidential conversations with the presidentBut as legal experts were split on whether Sessions correctly followed protocol by refusing to answer_questions in case Trump wanted to invoke privilegeTrumps critics are quick to jump to calls for impeachment but its a The Constitution lays the grounds for impeachment as treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors but high crimes and misdemeanors is not clearly defined Based on the legal and historical interpretation of the word high the word can be used to describe the position of the person holding high public office (ie president vice_president federal judges) not the severity of the crime or misdemeanorThe independent investigator or special_counsel would complete the investigation and report the findings Then Congress would decide how to move_forward and decide whether the findings amount to high crimes and misdemeanorsImpeachment starts in the House with a majority vote Think of the House as the body bringing charges or an indictment The Senate has power to try the impeachment and essentially convict or acquit the individual of the charges with a supermajorityIt is not the role of this Office [of Independent Counsel] to determine_whether the Presidents actions warrant impeachment by the House and removal by the Senate those judgments are of course constitutionally entrusted to the legislative branch according to of the Clinton investigationThe Starr report found 11 possible grounds for Clintons impeachment all having to do with Clintons false_statements under_oath about his sexual activities with Monica Lewinsky Clinton was accused of repeatedly lying under_oath to a grand_jury in his civil deposition and even to his own lawyer investigators found Clinton abused his constitutional authority by lying to the public and Congress throughout 1998 and tried to obstruct justice investigators foundIn December 1998 the House impeached Clinton accusing Clinton of perjury and of obstruction of justice Then in February 1999 the Senate acquitted Clinton of both charges Five Republicans and all 45 Democrats supported full acquittalAndrew Johnson was the only other president who was impeached amid his political fights with the Republican-controlled Congress over his Reconstruction-era policies The House brought 11 impeachment charges_against Johnson in 1868 alleging him of high crimes and conspiracies but was narrowly acquitted by SenatePresident Richard M Nixon was threatened with impeachment but resigned during impeachment investigations()Republican Donald Trump gave a speech on June 22 attacking Democratic rival Hillary_Clinton in back-to-back speeches by the two presumptive presidential nominees aimed_at undermining eachothers credentialsA large portion of his speech criticized Clintons record as secretary of state and donations given to the Clinton_Foundation as outlined in Peter Schweizers book Clinton Cash The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich One of the strongest charges Trump made was that Clinton ran the State_Department like her own personal hedge fund doing favors for oppressive regimes and many others and really many many others in exchange for cashBut Trump offered little evidence to back up this charge which doesnt make much sense beyond being an easy soundbite It ignores the fact that the actions of Clinton and Clinton_Foundation have been heavily scrutinized over the years and thatcritics including Schweizer have not been able to prove quid pro quoWe fact-checked 25 claims from Trumps speech including many thathave been previously debunked (See our fact-check on Clintons June 21 speech )The quotes are in the order in which they were delivered As is our custom in such roundups we do not provide a Pinocchio ratingThe Fact_Checker has run 10fact checks on Clintons often-misleading email statements Heres to a summary of the fact checksAs for Clintons Bosnia statement that she remembered landing under sniper fire made during the 2008 campaign The Fact_Checker first exposed that including the video of the flower greeting Heres a link to Trump repeatedly makes this false statement that he started his business_empire with just a $1 million loan from his father But that is simply not credible as we documented Trump appears to have inherited about $40 million He also benefited from numerous loans and loan guarantees as well as his fathers connections to make the move into Manhattan His father set_up lucrative trusts to provide steady income When Trump became overextended in the casino business his father bailed him out with a shady casino-chip loan and Trump also borrowed $9 million against his future inheritance While Trump often asserts it has not been easy for me he glosses over the fact that his father paved the way for his success and that his father bailed him out when he got into troubleThis figure is about right Bill and Hillary_Clinton were personally paid $1583 millionfrom paid speeches between 2001 and 2015 according to Washington_Post analysis of their financial disclosures However its unclear how many were given to lobbyists chief executives or foreign_governments as the payment records do not reflect that level of detailTrump is right if he is referring to the was a tariff act The founders of the new nation were eager that the United_States develop its own manufacturing component and not become dependent on Great Britain for manufactured goods Interestingly the free traders at the time resided in the deep South where planters depended on selling raw materials (such as cotton) overseasWashington directed Alexander Hamilton as secretary of the Treasury to write a report on manufacturing Report on Manufactures which Hamilton delivered to Congress in December 1791 Washington was certainly interested in manufacturing though the chief figure encouraging protection of manufacturing was Hamilton said Julie Miller early America historian at the Library of CongressClinton did support her husbands embrace of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993 But its worth recalling the agreementwas and approved by Congress with a majority of Republican votesMoreover the Congressional Research_Service in 2015 the net overall effect of NAFTA on the US economy appears to have been relatively modest primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of US GDP Heres This was in reference to NAFTA which took effect in January 1994 and China joining the World Trade Organization in December 2001 The raw numbers check out there were 17 million manufacturing jobs in January 1994 16 million in December 2001 and 12 million as of March_2016 according to the Bureau of Labor StatisticsBut its more complex than that Not all these jobs were lost due to trade the manufacturing sector has declined as a source of jobs in the United_States as productivity has risen The it is difficult to measure the exact impact of trade compared to other variables that can affect the economy such as inflation and economic growthIt is bit silly to blame a secretary of state for a trade deficit which is mostly the result of decisions by businesses and consumers but lets check Trumps math anywayThe US trade deficit with China was $268 billion in 2008 and increased to $315 billion in 2012 the period that would cover Clintons four years as secretary of state Thats an increase of $47 billion or 175 percent So Trump overshoots the mark by more_than double (Some readers suggested Trump was measuring from 2009 to 2013 That does show an increase of 40_percent in part because the Great Recession weakened trade in 2009 But thats the wrong window of time because it leaves off her first year as secretary of state and includes a year when she was not secretary)Clinton as secretary of state supported TPP negotiations but once the trade pact with 12 Asian rim nations was completed she announced she opposed it Any claims about either job gains or job losses from TPP There are going to be winners and losers as in any trade deal but the overall impact will be more modest than either supporters or opponents claimsTrump overstates this claim a bit Clinton did remove a number of sections regarding TPP from the paperback version of her book Hard Choices supposedly for space reasons (The Center for Economic and Policy Research )But references to TPP can still be found on pages 69-70 such as One of our most_important tools for engaging with Vietnam was a proposed new trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) which would link markets throughout Asia and the Americas lowering trade barriers while raising standards on labor the environment and intellectual propertyThere is no_evidence to back up Trumps claim about the Benghazi attacks on Sept 11 2012 Clinton did leave the State_Department before 11 pm at which point it was fairly clear that Stevens had perished By her own testimony before Congress Clinton did_not go to sleep that night and was in constant contact with State I had other equipment that kept me in touch with the State_Department at all times I did_not sleep all night I was very much focused on what we were doingOur colleagues at FactCheckorg have no requests from Stevens for additional security went directly to Clinton As for hundreds and hundreds of requests this is likely an exaggerated figure A figure of 600 circulated by the House Select Committee on Benghazi actually reflects requests and concerns and Democrats say fewer than 200 requests can be catalogued Moreover while some requests were not fulfilled others were acted on Trumps claims that all of the requests were ignored is wrongThis has been a frequent GOP attack line but the victims families have disagreed strongly about what Clinton told them in the aftermath of the attacks and tracked down as many family members as possible Clinton says that in speaking with the families she did_not blame the Benghazi attacks on the video Most participants we interviewed (four out of six) back up her version saying they do not recall her mentioning a videoClinton was a backer of intervention in Libya but so was Donald Trump Trump said this in a video blog in February 2011Many experts would argue that Iran gained influence in the region when the United_States under President George_W Bush toppled the Iraqi regime headed by Saddam Hussein a key enemy of the Islamic state (Clinton as a senator voted to authorize an invasion) As for the international agreement on Irans nuclear_program that is supposed to thwart Tehrans path to a weaponTrump has repeatedly and falsely claimed he was against the Iraq war Instead there is far more evidence that he supported the invasion There is nothing in the public record that shows he opposed the war until more_than a year after the war started and the US occupation started to run into troubleThere is a book by a former Secret_Service agent due to be released on June 28 that But several former Secret_Service agents including the president of the Association of Former Agents of the United_States Secret_Service that the author was too low-ranking to have seen any of what he claimsTrump has repeatedly made this hundreds of thousands claim usually referring to Syria The Obama_administration said it would accept a total of 85000 refugees in 2016 and 100000 in 2017 Thats from all countries of which 10000 would be from Syria in 2016 (In September Clinton said she in 2017) In fiscal 2013 about 30 percent came from the Middle_East mostly from Iraq So no matter how you calculate it it does_not add up to hundreds of thousandsTrump also falsely claims there is no way to screen refugees The process actually takes two more years after vetting that starts with the United_Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and then continues with checks by US intelligence and security agenciesThis is a revised Trump talking point on migrants convicted of terrorist activity to include migrants and their children (We previously awarded him for claiming that scores of recent migrants were charged with terrorism)Were not sure exactly where Trump is getting this information but heis still not accurateWe reviewed cases from 2014 and 2015 involving 76 people charged with activities relating to foreign terrorist organizations The majority of those cases involved naturalized US citizens andlawful permanent residentsThere were both naturalized and natural-born US citizens (including those of Caucasian African American or Hispanic descent) Many of the naturalized citizens had arrived in the country as children and therefore not recent immigrantsSince 9/11there have been 140 non-US born individuals and 151 US-born citizens charged with jihadist terrorism-related crime in the United Statesaccording to analysis by the Trump repeats aclaim fromClinton Cash in reference to a November 2011 speech that Bill_Clinton gave to the Swedish telecom company Ericsson for $750000 Earlier that year Ericsson was named in an April 2011 State_Department report for selling telecom equipment to oppressive regimes and the State_Department was coming up with new sanctions for Iran Schweizer wrote When the Obama_administration revealed its sanctions for Iran a week after Bill_Clintons speech telecom was not on the listSchweizer notes that in April 2012 Obama signed an executive_order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to Iran and Syria but did_not cover Ericssons work in Iran Hillary_Clintons spokesman that the sanctions were imposed through executive action by Obama not by Clinton and that the April 2012 executive_order was directed at the users of technology who sought to stifle dissidents as opposed to the equipment manufacturers like EricssonAn entire chapter is dedicated to in Clinton Cash In the book Schweizer reveals ties_between the Clinton_Foundation and investors who stood to gain from a deal that required State_Department approvalClintons aides said she did_not intervene in the deal Trumps claim suggests the State_Department had sole approval authority but the department is one of nine agencies in the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United_States to vet and sign off on all US transactions involving foreign_governments As the Nuclear Regulatory Commission also needed to approve and did approve the transferTop US officials may accept gifts on behalf of the US government in circumstances where not accepting the gift would cause embarrassment to the donor and to the US government Clinton accepted a gold sapphire and diamond necklace worth $58000 from Bruneis queen The government of Brunei over the years to the Clinton FoundationBut to be transferred to the National Archives or General Services AdministrationThe necklace was recorded in the Federal Register to the General Services AdministrationClinton on the trade accord if elected presidentThe Clinton_Foundation has acceptedmillions from countries like Saudi_Arabia Kuwait Qatar and Oman despite their poor human_rights record The Washington_Post has covered foreign donations to the Clinton_Foundation and foreign sources made up a third of those who gave the foundation more_than $1 million over time The foundation said the donations went to fund the organizationsphilanthropic work around the worldAmnesty is a rhetorical term for granting undocumented_immigrants a pathway to citizenship which Clinton does support But Trump exaggerates on immigration enforcement focusing immigration resources on detaining and deporting those who pose a threat to public safety[ Hacked emails released on Oct 7 showed Clinton apparently said in a paid closed-door speechto a Brazilian bank My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders through green energyThe Clinton campaign has refused to authenticate the hacked emails but campaign_manager Robby Mook said in an Oct 9 CBS Face the Nation interview that Clinton was talking_about integrating green energy between North and South America If the question is Does Hillary_Clinton support throwing open our borders Absolutely not And she is going to do everything she can to fight to protect the interests of workers in this country]This is questionable Theres not a definitive figure for the cost ofClintons plans for refugees but she has proposed for immigrant integrationservices and creating a national office of immigrant affairsTheObama administration has requested roughly$22 billion for fiscal 2017 for refugee assistance as PolitiFact noted Clintons request would be higher asshe supports accepting more Syrian refugees than Obama PolitiFact rated Trumps claim after estimating Clintons plan could cost around $3 billion or $4 billion While its not clear how Trump wants to rebuild inner cities but the backlog to repairsubstandard housing alone in American cities would cost at_least $26 billionTrump loves to say this but that doesnt make it any truer than the last time it was fact checkedThe statistics dont lie the United_States isnt anywhere near the top among industrialized nationsIn 2014 according to of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) revenue as a percentage of the gross domestic product the broadest measure of the economy was 26 percent for the United StatesOut of 34 countries that put the United_States in the bottom third and well below the OECD average of 344 percent()Ifthe special_counsel independent investigation_into Russia collusion was going to charge someone five months in it makes senseIn many ways Trumps former campaign_chairman is squarely in the crosshairs of the Russia-Trump collusion investigation His brief tenure as the head of Trumps campaign happened as concerns about Russias meddling in the 2016 election were heating up hes got high-level connections to Russia in his own right and hes got a whole host of scrutinized financial dealings that could make him a useful tool forinvestigators seeking cooperationManafort and his former business_partner Rick_Gates have been ordered to turn themselves in on charges related to the investigation on Monday Heres why Manaforthas become such a likely target for the special_counsel If Robert_S Mueller_IIIs team is investigating Trump-Russia connections it is not going to stop at some low-level Trump associate These investigators are going straight to the top to see if they find evidence of collusion and for several key months in 2016 Manafort was the top He likely has knowledge of the inner workings of the campaign said Jeffrey Jacobovitz a white collar lawyer who has represented members of the Clinton administration When Donald Trump Jr was told the Russian_government was trying to help his father win and oh by the way do you want to meet with a Russian lawyer who has dirt on Hillary_Clinton Trump Jr didnt go alone He brought along Manafort and Jared_Kushner Trumps son-in-lawIt appears Manafort took detailed notes of that meeting and those notes could be key evidence if there are any collusion-related chargesThat meetings circumstances are as close as you can get to a smoking gun onwhether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia Jacobovitz and other legal experts said at the time A Russian aluminum_magnate A pro-Russian former Ukrainian president A Republican congressman who advocates for close ties_between the United_States and Russia A business associate from his time in Ukraine who once served in the Russian army and had dinner with Manafort during the campaignOf all the Trump campaign officials Manafort has the most known connections to Russia Before he joined Trumps campaign he was a political consultant in Ukraine where he helped elect a president backed by Russia (That president was toppled four years later and fled to safety in Russia) in June that Manaforts consulting_firm received $17 million over two years from that presidents political party the Party of RegionsDuring the campaign the New_York Times uncovered ledgers in Ukraine for secret under-the-table payments to the Party of Regions allies Manaforts name was in them though he denied any wrongdoing The news eventually led to Manaforts resignation from Trumps campaign three months after he got elevated to the top job Manaforts role in the Trump campaign isnt the only aspect of his life under federal investigation Hes also being investigated for money_laundering a $35 million mortgage he took out on his home in the Hamptons and whether heviolated any laws by not fully disclosing his work as a foreign agent in UkraineThats significant leverage investigators have on Manafort Ifthey cant persuade Manafort to cooperate on the Russia investigation and the FBI raid then these charges are evidence they couldntthey could potentially force him to cooperate by threatening him with unrelated legal troubleThreateningsomeone with legal trouble is a common tactic to try to get them to cooperate with the broader investigationJacobovitz said Its possible the special_counsel is using those same kinds of tools on Michael_Flynn Trumps former national_security adviser who is facing legal questions over his failure to disclose his lobbying work for Turkey Investigators have also zeroed in on Flynns sons work abroadIts a first step and it could be one of many Jacobovitz saidFor all these reasons Manafort is also the perfect target to send a message to the rest of WashingtonsaidJack Sharman a white-collar lawyer in Alabama and former special_counsel for Congress during the Bill_Clinton Whitewater investigation who talked to The Fix in August unannounced before dawn And that message is the special_counsel investigation means business and isnt afraid to target high level members of the Trump campaignNewly discovered emails found on a computer seized during an investigation of disgraced former congressman Anthony_Weiner thrust the controversy over Hillary_Clintons use of a private_server back into the presidential campaign less_than two_weeks before the electionOfficials said the discovery prompted a surprise announcement Friday by FBI_Director James_B Comey that the agency would once_again be examining emails related to Clintons time as secretary of stateIn a letter to lawmakers Comey said the FBI would take appropriate investigative steps to determine_whether the newly discovered emails contain classified_information and to assess whether they are relevant to the Clinton server probeThe emails numbering more_than 1000 were found on a computer used by both Weiner (D-NY) and his wife top Clinton aide Huma Abedin according to law_enforcement officials with knowledge of the inquiry who spoke on the condition of anonymityThe correspondence included emails between Abedin and Clinton according to a law_enforcement officialFederal officials have been examining sexually suggestive online messages that Weiner allegedly exchanged with a teenage girl The link to the Weiner investigation was first reported by the New_York TimesComeys announcement appears to resume the FBIs probe of Clintons server which previously ended in July The announcement could reshape a presidential race that Clinton the Democratic_nominee has been leading in most public polls It was immediately hailed by Republican nominee Donald Trump who told supporters at a New Hampshire rally that perhaps finally justice will be done The crowd responded with pumped fists and chants of Lock_her up Lock_her upClinton told_reporters Friday night in Iowa that she learned of the newly discovered emails only after the letter to Congress was made publicIm confident whatever [the emails] are will not change the conclusion reached in July she said Therefore its imperative that the bureau explain this issue in question whatever it is without any delayAsked about the connection to Weiner Clinton said Weve heard these rumors We dont_know what to believe Clinton campaign_chairman John_Podesta called it extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11_days out from a presidential_election Officials familiar_with the inquiry said it was too early to assess the significance of the newly discovered emails It is possible they said that some or all of the correspondence is duplicative of the emails that were already turned over and examined by the FBIComey made a similar point in his letter sent to congressional committee chairmen saying that the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significantThe letter which was three paragraphs long contained few detailsHe wrote that the FBI in connection with an unrelated case had recently learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the Clinton investigationComey wrote that he was briefed on the new material Thursday I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine_whether they contain classified_information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation he wrote An FBI spokesman on Friday declined to elaborate and a spokesman for Attorney_General Loretta E Lynch declined to commentComey provided no details about the unrelated case that resulted in the discovery of the new emailsThe official said that Comey once told about the find felt an obligation to inform Congress since he had previously told lawmakers that the investigation had been completedAbedin who has worked for Clinton since the 1990s is vice chairman of Clintons presidential campaign She exchanged thousands of emails with Clinton while_serving as her deputy chief of staff at the State_Department She like Clinton used an email address routed through the private serverNeither Weiner nor an attorney for Abedin responded to requests for commentWeiner who represented a New_York City congressional district from his House seat in 2011 after he accidentally tweeted an explicit photo of himself that he had intended to send to a supporterAbedin and Weiner were married in 2010 with former president Bill_Clinton officiating Abedin announced this past August that she was from Weiner following a report in the New_York Post about another sexting incidentThe federal inquiry into Weiners contact with the teenager was sparked by a September in the Daily Mail tabloidWhen Comey announced the FBIs findings in July he said that Clinton had been extremely careless in her handling of classified material which was found among the emails exchanged on her private serverHe said then that his investigators had found evidence of potential violation of laws governing the handling of classified informationBut he said no reasonable prosecutor would bring charges because investigators had not found evidence that there had been intentional mishandling of classified material or indications of disloyalty to the United_States or efforts to obstruct justice Comey had come under enormous pressure from Republicans for his recommendation to bring no case against Clinton Trump has repeatedly cited the decision as a sign of corruption endemic to Washington institutions and has promised that if elected he would reopen the investigationPodesta on Friday cited the political pressure on Comey in questioning the directors actions saying that Republicans had been browbeating career FBI officials to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary_Clintons presidential campaignDemocrats said Friday that the lack of detail from the FBI allowed Republicans to mischaracterize its actions Clinton campaign spokesman Brian_Fallon told CNN that Comey was unleashing a wildfire of innuendoThe top Democrat on the Senate_Intelligence Committee SenDianne Feinstein (Calif) issued a blistering statement Friday expressing shock at the FBIs vague announcement which she said played right into the political campaign of Donald TrumpThe FBI has a history of extreme caution near Election_Day so as not to influence the results she said Todays break from that tradition is appallingSome lawmakers saw the announcement as a potential game-changer for the electionA total bombshell said Rep Peter T King (R-NY) a member of the House Homeland_Security Committee King predicted that the FBI would not close its inquiry before the election and said he believed that Comey wanted the public to know of his move regardless of the outcomeHe wants it all out there King saidBut there was confusion about the FBIs announcement and immediate calls from lawmakers in both parties for additional informationSen Charles_E Grassley (R-Iowa) chairman of the Senate_Judiciary Committee and a frequent Clinton critic called the letter unsolicited and quite honestly surprisingCongress and the public deserve more context to properly assess what evidence the FBI has discovered and what it plans to do with it Grassley said Clintons campaign has been bedeviled by the email controversy since before its formal launch in April 2015Hacked emails released in recent_days by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks show that even some of her closest campaign aides were surprised by her use of the server and frustrated by her response including her slowness to apologizeDid you have any idea of the depth of this story Podesta asked campaign_manager Robby Mook late on March 2 2015 the day the New_York Times revealed that Clinton had exclusively used a private account as secretaryNope Mook replied early the next_day We brought up the existence of emails in [research] this summer but were told that everything was taken care ofPolls show that the issue has hurt Clinton politically A Washington Post-ABC News poll last_month found that more_than 6 in 10 Americans did_not approve of the way Clinton had been handling questions about her email setupThe State Departments deputy spokesman Mark Toner said the FBI has not notified the department of the new emails and he referred all questions to the bureauWe stand ready to cooperate if were asked to do so he told_reporters But I dont have any additional details at this point Jenna Johnson Tom_Hamburger Carol Morello Adam Entous and Ellen_Nakashima contributed to this_reportThe Obama_administration is seeking to amend surveillance law to give the FBI explicit authority to access a persons Internet browser history and other electronic data without a warrant in terrorism and spy casesThe administration made six years_ago but dropped it after concerns were raised by privacy advocates and the tech industryFBI Director_James B_Comey has characterized the legislation as a fix to a typo in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act which he says has led some tech firms to refuse to provide data that Congress intended them to provide But tech firms and privacy advocates say the bureau is seeking an expansion of surveillance powers that infringes on Americans privacyNow at the FBIs request some lawmakers are advancing legislation that would allow the bureau to obtain electronic communication transactional records using an administrative subpoena known as a national_security letter An NSL can be issued by the special agent in charge of a bureau field office without a judges approvalSuch records may include a persons Internet protocol address and how_much time a person spends on a given site But they dont include content such as the text of an e-mail or Google search queries Theres also a limit to how_much visibility the bureau would have into which part of a website a person had visited For_instance according to the bureau if the person went to any part of The Washington_Posts website law_enforcement would see only washingtonpostcom nothing more specificComey said that making this change to the law is the bureaus top legislative priority this yearThe inability to obtain the data with an NSL affects our work in a very very big and practical way he told the Senate_Intelligence Committee in FebruaryThe Senate panel recently voted out an authorization bill with the NSL amendment The Senate_Judiciary Committee this week is considering a similar provision introduced by to ECPA a law governing domestic surveillanceCornyn said that what he characterized as a scriveners error in the law is needlessly hamstringing our counterintelligence and counterterrorism effortsBut privacy groups and tech firms are again warning that the expansion of power would erode civil-liberties protectionsThe fix the FBI seeks would dramatically expand the ability of the FBI to get sensitive information about users online activities without oversight said a coalition of privacy and civil society groups and industry organizations in a letter sent to the Hill MondayThe new categories of information that could be collected using an NSL would paint an incredibly intimate picture of a persons life said the letter signed by the American Civil Liberties Union Amnesty International USA the Computer & Communications Industry Association Google Facebook and Yahoo among others For_example a persons browsing history location information and certain email data could reveal details about a persons political affiliation medical conditions religion and movements throughout the day they saidIn addition the NSL would come with a gag order preventing the company from disclosing it had a received a government request said Neema Singh Guliani ACLU legislative counsel The letter noted that over the past 10years the FBI has issued more_than 300000 NSLs most of which had gag orders Thats the perfect storm of more information gathered less transparency and no accountability Gulani saidBut a law passed last_year the USA Freedom Act requires the Justice_Department to review gag orders periodically to assess whether they are still justifiedThe amendment being considered Thursday by the Judiciary_Committee is part of a broader effort by lawmakers to update ECPA to require law_enforcement to get a warrant for all email content regardless of whether it is one day or one year old Privacy groups and tech companies support the broader ECPA update versions of which some lawmakers have sought for yearsBut the groups and tech organizations in their letter said that if the ECPA bill includes the NSL provision they will pull their supportA November 2008 opinion from the Justice_Departments Office of Legal Counsel made clear that ECPA allows the FBI to obtain with an NSL only four types of basic subscriber information from Internet companies name address length of service and telephone bill records There is no reference in the law to browser history for instance The opinion said the four existing categories were exhaustiveThe FBIs Office of General Counsel however has argued that electronic communication transactional records are the functional equivalent of telephone billing records To eliminate any uncertainty the FBI wants the law to explicitly cover such dataSens Patrick J Leahy (D-Vt) the ranking minority-party member on the Judiciary_Committee and Mike Lee (R-Utah) a committee member oppose the Cornyn amendment They say they will push for a clean version of the ECPA update similar to a bill passed by the House earlier_this yearThe troops searching for Bowe Bergdahl were sleep-deprived and thirsty Temperatures in mountainous Ghazni near Afghanistans border with Pakistan crested 100 degrees Although it was unusual to be without ready resupply for more_than a few_days the inconceivable disappearance of a US soldier called for round-the-clock missions far from their logistical hubsAfter 10 days in the field their socks began to rot Protective gloves frayed They were dependent on Russian contractors to airdrop in more drinking water but the hasty resupply included none only Gatorade muffins and hygiene products The soldiers vented their frustration by blowing up the pallets then continued their search for Bergdahls ghostThis episode described to The Washington_Post by a former member of Bergdahls unit illustrates one of the Armys chief arguments for sending Bergdahl to prison By abandoning his post in June 2009 he set in motion a chain of events that proved distracting to the Afghanistan war effort and put at grave risk the thousands of people tasked with finding him Bergdahl now 31 would spend five_years in Taliban captivity before the Obama White_House secured his release in a controversial prisoner exchange in 2014 He has pleaded_guilty to charges of desertion and misbehavior_before the enemy which carries a maximum sentence of life in prisonThe judge who will determine Bergdahls fate Army Col Jeffrey R Nance is set to hear on Wednesday from troops who say their serious injuries are linked to Bergdahls disappearance testimony that could determine the severity of Bergdahls punishmentNance also is expected to rule on a motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that President Trump who has referred to Bergdahl as a dirty rotten traitor to impartial proceedingsWednesdays testimony may include Army Sgt 1st Class Mark Allen who was shot in the head during a search mission and is confined to a wheelchair Senior Chief Petty Officer James Hatch a Navy SEAL also has said his career was ended after being shot in the leg during a hastily planned operation to locate Bergdahl He too may appear in courtNeither Allen nor Hatch would have been where they were doing what they were doing but for the actions of the accused Nance wrote in a July court filingThe defense has argued that Bergdahl cannot be held responsible for successive events stemming from his disappearance and abduction His lawyers have questioned how_much blame Bergdahl shoulders for what occurred to others because of his actionsMore clear is how the expansive search effort affected the war in eastern Afghanistan at the time Counterinsurgency operations were halted along with preparations for a national election to shift all available resources to finding BergdahlThe former member of Bergdahls unit who described the botched resupply mission said a surge in related nighttime raids upset many Afghans at a time US forces needed their support to help counter the Talibans influence It angered most soldiers too he told The_Post on the condition of anonymity to avoid conflicts with his current employer The militarys sacred mantra of leave no man behind was challenged by the extraordinary event of a soldier leaving his post voluntarily he saidResources flooded into Afghanistans Paktika province such as surveillance drones helicopter support and equipment used to intercept phone and radio traffic But that came at a cost to units outside the search area forced to fight with fewer advantages the former soldier saidIn one instance five days after Bergdahls disappearance a US combat outpost was nearly overrun by hundreds of Taliban fighters resulting in the death of two US soldiers Those soldiers were surprised by their attackers they would later say because they lacked drones and other intelligence assets that had been diverted to find Bergdahl the former soldier recalledBoth the prosecution and defense have the opportunity to present arguments that could influence the judges decision There is little doubt the prosecution will focus on how the war was affected by search efforts said Brian Bouffard a former Navy lawyer The defense meanwhile might zero in on reports such as one in that said search missions in Afghanistan continued even after the Pentagon was confident Bergdahl was being held in PakistanIf anyone is wounded on a futile mission there is a lot of blame to go around there Bouffard said And I dont_think you can lay that on BergdahlBut many who served with Bergdahl blame him for tragedies that befell other members of their unit and frustration has lingered among those who feel their combat tour and everything since remains defined by Bergdahls disappearance the former soldier saidIts like he added the deployment that never endsCarter Page who served briefly as a foreign_policy adviser to Donald Trumps presidential campaign made an appearance in a federal espionage case because he communicated several years_ago with a Russian intelligence agent under surveillance by the FBIIn a statement released Tuesday Page confirmed his role in the 2015 Justice_Department spy case adding another twist to the still-unfolding story of Trumps peculiar and expanding connected to RussiaPage said he assisted US prosecutors in their case against Evgeny Buryakov an undercover Kremlin agent then posing as a bank executive in New_York Buryakov was convicted of espionage and released from federal prison last_week a few months short of completing a 30-month sentence Buryakov agreed to be immediately deported to RussiaPages involvement was first disclosed Monday by BuzzFeed which said Page was identified as Male1 in the Justice_Departments complaint against a Russian spy network based in New YorkIn a written exchange with The Washington_Post Page confirmed playing a role in the case but declined to discuss detailsGiven the very light masking in the original document from January 2015 you can draw your own conclusions Page wroteAccording to the court_records the FBI interviewed Page as part of the case against three Russian men identified as agents of the Russian overseas intelligence agency the SVR One of them Buryakov was operating undercover as an executive in the New_York office of a Russian development bank The case resurfaced in news accounts last_week when President Trumps adviser and son-in-law_Jared Kushner acknowledged he had met with the head of the same bank in DecemberThe complaint includes transcripts from 2013 of wiretapped conversations among the Russians discussing their efforts to recruit Male1 identified as a New_York energy trader whom the Russians described as willing to talkIn his statement Page compared the revelation of his role to the politically-motivated unmasking standards seen in the Obama Administration which have recently been exposedHe said the information was released as retribution for my public positions of dissent against Obama_administration policy toward Russia The information about his role in the case amplified the reputational damage against me that has occurred through 2016 Page said After he was named by Trump as a foreign_policy adviser news reports discussed his travel to Russia and his frequent criticism of US policy toward Russia under ObamaAccording to the 2015 complaint filed in federal court in the Southern_District of New_York Page met with a Russian agent Victor Podobnyy in January 2013 at an energy conference in New_York It says that from January to June of that year Page as Male1 provided documents to [Podobnyy] about the energy business At the time the Russians were seeking information on US sanctions and on energy developmentAlthough Page communicated with the Russian agents in 2013 he said the information he provided was innocuousAs I explained to federal authorities prior to the January 2015 filing of this case I shared basic immaterial information and publicly available research documents with the spy who was serving then as a junior attache at the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United NationsIn doing so I provided him nothing more_than a few samples from the far more detailed lectures I was preparing at the time for the students in my Spring 2013 semester Energy and the World Politics Markets and Technology course which I taught on Saturdays at New_York UniversityDuring an_interview with The Washington_Post editorial page staff in March_2016 Trump identified Page once a Merrill_Lynch investment banker in Moscow as a foreign_policy adviser to his campaignBut in January after Pages name came up in news reports about Trump administration ties to Russia Trump press_secretary Sean_Spicer declared that Carter_Page is an individual the president-elect does_not knowPage a longtime energy executive is a US Naval Academy graduate who rose through the ranks at Merrill_Lynch before founding his current firm Global Energy Capital He previously was a fellow at the Council on Foreign_Relations where he focused on the Caspian Sea region and economic_development in former Soviet states He is also a fellow at the Center for National Policy in Washington and has a PhD from the University of LondonHe made in July that included some criticism of US policyThe White_House has energetically rejected the idea that Trump or his allies coordinated with Russia during the election The president has said investigators and the public should focus instead on leaks of information and reports that he and his advisers were improperly surveilled by the Obama administrationThe real story turns out to be SURVEILLANCE and LEAKING Find the leakers Trump tweeted Monday morningPage has said repeatedly in recent_weeks that he would like to tell his story to congressional_investigators looking at Russian_government efforts to influence the course of the 2016 election and the leak of information about that effortI very much look_forward to providing further evidence regarding last years historic crimes committed against me and all Americans Page saidRepublican gubernatorial candidate Ed_Gillespie on Monday launched a TV ad claiming that Democrat Ralph_Northam made it easier for violent felons and sex offenders to get their hands on gunsThe ad is based on outgoing Gov Terry McAuliffes sweeping actions to restore voting and other civil_rights to felons In one of the few states that permanently disenfranchises felons McAuliffe (D) has restored the right to vote and to serve on juries to more_than 168000 felons who have completed their sentences His action also helped them over the first hurdle to have their gun rights restored although the felons still need judges to sign offLast year Terry McAuliffe and Ralph_Northam instituted the automatic restoration of rights for violent felons and sex offenders making it easier for them to obtain firearms and allowing them to serve on juries the ad begins One of these felons John Bowen had his rights restored two months after being found with one of the largest child pornography collections in Virginias historyBowen of Accomack County was convicted of aggravated sexual battery and indecent liberties with a minor in 2001 and served a one-year sentence reported Like other felons who had completed their sentences he had his rights restored under McAuliffe Bowen lost his voting_rights again in January when he pleaded_guilty to a new felony possession of child pornography He is serving 15 years in prison the paper reported in JuneMcAuliffe (D) on Monday tore into Gillespie for what he saw as an attack on one of his signature achievements in office one that Northam as a member of McAuliffes administration has called one of our greatest featsIts based on the same fears and same division we saw from Donald Trump McAuliffe said during a conference call with news media that was hastily arranged to respond to the ad This is a page right out of Donald Trumps playbook Hes gone into the gutter one more time This is one of the most divisive campaigns I have ever seenIf you look at the ad and the individual he uses in the ad obviously he is trying to sensationalize the issue McAuliffe said Ed is trying to divide people and scare people as he has done this whole campaignThe Northam campaign attacked Gillespie for running one of the most virulently negative and ugly campaigns in recent memorySince he has no positive ideas hes resorted to lying about Dr Northam Northam spokesman David Turner said It is a new low for him to accuse a pediatrician and childrens hospice medical director of favoring felons who have hurt children Ralph believes all Virginians who have served their time and are law-abiding should have their rights restored and thats never changed Ed knows that and should be ashamedComing two_weeks before Election_Day the ad doubles down on the law-and-order theme that Gillespies campaign thinks will play well with suburban swing voters as well as conservatives who voted for Trump last_year For weeks Gillespie has aired ads that seek to blame Northam for the rise of the MS-13 street gang Critics including former president_Barack Obama at a Northam rally in Richmond last_week have called the ad an attempt at fearmongeringWhat hes really trying to deliver is fear Obama said Most public polls indicate that the race will be tight Political observers are watching the contest the only competitive governors race in the nation this year as a referendum on Trump and a hint of what could come in next yearss congressional midterms Virginia is one of a handful of states that permanently disenfranchises felons The Virginia Constitution however gives the governor authority to restore the right to vote serve on a jury and run for public officeMcAuliffes predecessor Robert F McDonnell (R) simplified and accelerated that process but McAuliffe took it to a new level With great fanfare on the steps of the state Capitol in April_2016 McAuliffe announced that he had restored rights to 206000 He heralded his action as a way for Virginia to move past the Jim Crow era noting that African Americans have been disproportionately affected by felon disenfranchisement A year later McAuliffe said he had restored more voting_rights than any other US governor calling it his proudest achievement in office But it has been a bumpy road to the record booksMcAuliffe had intended his original executive_order to cover only felons who had served their time and completed parole but he mistakenly restored rights to 132 sex offenders still in custody as well as to several convicted killers on probation in other statesRepublican legislators furious because the order included violent felons and those who had not paid court costs or made restitution to their victims filed a lawsuit with the state Supreme_Court The GOP won with the court ruling that the governor had exceeded his clemency powers because he restored rights en masse instead of individuallySince then the governor has used a fast but individualized approach to restore rights to 156000 felons a process that passed muster with the high courtVirginia Republican Ed_Gillespie has released four ads that try to tie his Democratic rival for governor Ralph_Northam to MS-13_gang violence despite protests from Democrats and Latino groups that the commercials play on racial stereotypesThe latest ad which started airing this week in the Roanoke market begins with a dark hooded figure in a home holding up a baseball bat as the MS-13 motto Kill Rape Control flashes on the screen Then a narrator warns of violent crime linked to the street gang in Virginia and accuses Northam of putting Virginia families at riskNortham cast the deciding vote in favor of sanctuary_cities that let illegal immigrants who commit crimes back on the street increasing the threat of MS-13 the narrator says a claim that the nonpartisan FactCheckorg calls misleading The new ad echoes a aired last_week by the Gillespie campaign that interspersed images of Northam with the MS-13 motto and tattooed faces of men who as it turns out were not MS-13 members and were photographed in a prison in El SalvadorThat commercial which launched in the television markets serving Charlottesville and Southside and southwestern Virginia has expanded to urban areas including Richmond and the DC market that includes Northern VirginiaThe MS-13 ads mark a shift in the tone of the Virginia governors race which is the nations marquee statewide contest this year and had been applauded by observers for its relative civilityBob Holsworth a former Virginia Commonwealth University political_scientist said the ads seem intended to grab the attention of voters and give them a compelling reason to go to the pollsThis is going back to an old-line Republican message that Democrats policies are making the streets less safe he said Whether its something thats going to motivate voters the polls dont seem to show that public safety is a critical issue in this race But I_think theres some belief in the Gillespie campaign that in a low-turnout election this can motivate voters The ads sparked a firestorm of criticism from Democrats who accused Gillespie of playing on fears of Latinos They likened the commercial to the used against Democrat Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential race that focused on an African American felon who committed crimes while out on a weekend furlough program in Massachusetts The commercial was damaging to Dukakis the governor of Massachusetts at the time of Hortons release Critics said the ad preyed on public fears of black criminalsGillespies commercials have attracted national notice Fox_News host Tucker Carlson on one of the ads this week sparring with Latino_Victory Fund President Cristbal J AlexCarlson said that members of MS-13 are often undocumented_immigrants and that sanctuary_cities offer them shelter Alex said the ad falsely equates undocumented_immigrants with gang_members and is part of a broader Republican effort to turn MS-13 into a Latino boogeymanBen Marchi a longtime Republican operative from Culpeper said the strategy is a smart attempt to attract suburban swing voters especially in places such as Prince William and Loudoun counties where gang_violence is a problemIts a great ad he said of the first spot That is the message that Virginians do care about They want to know theyre safe and right_now theres a problem with violent illegal aliensWhile Gillespies campaign normally rolls out new commercials with news releases and social_media blasts it did_not take similar steps for the MS-13 commercialsGillespie declined to comment about the ads after his appearance Thursday at a Richmond forum directing questions to spokesman David AbramsAbrams said via text As extensively reported by The Washington_Post MS-13 is a growing problem in Virginia Allowing for the establishment of sanctuary_cities in Virginia as Northam has voted for will not help us solve the problem or make us safer Ed opposes sanctuary_cities and he has put forward a substantive detailed plan to keep Virginians safeNortham appearing at the same forum called the ad unfortunateMy father was a judge My grandfather was a judge he said noting that the Virginia Sheriffs Association applauded him as legislator of the year in 2011 For someone to say that Im soft on crime or want to release convicted felons thats shortsightedNortham has said that anyone who commits a violent crime should be prosecuted regardless of immigration status Virginia is among the states that have seen a resurgence of MS-13 activity driven in part by the recent influx of unaccompanied teenage immigrants according to a cited in Gillespies campaign commercialsAuthorities say MS-13 is behind the recent deaths of a in Springfield a 21-year-old man in Dumfries and a 25-year-old man outside a bar in among othersNortham the states lieutenant governor did cast a tiebreaking vote in February against a GOP bill that would have banned sanctuary_cities localities that choose not to cooperate with federal immigration authoritiesBut the bill ultimately passed the state Senate so Northam did_not cast the deciding vote It was later vetoed by Gov Terry McAuliffe (D)Meanwhile Virginia has no such localities a fact that Gillespie has acknowledged but that is omitted from his adsVirginia voters will choose a new governor on Nov7As Moscow lashed out Thursday at Ukraines new leaders and the Western nations it believes to be backing them ousted president Viktor_Yanukovych resurfaced in Russia and claimed he is still Ukraines legitimate head of stateYanukovych now apparently under Russias protection hadnt been heard from since he fled Kiev on Saturday He argued in a statement distributed Thursday that his opponents had reneged on a they had signed with him last Friday The Russian_government which had refused to endorse the deal at the time now says it agrees with him and wants the There is little chance of that happening and Moscow knows itBut it gives the government of President_Vladimir Putin a justification for its refusal to have any dealings with the new authorities in Kiev which is under immense strain from pro-Russia protests on the Crimean Peninsula coffers left empty by Yanukovych and uncertain control of the countryThe new leaders are also facing a major Russian military exercise on their doorstep And they must contend with militant groups on the Maidan the protest site in Kiev that is also known as Independence Square who see them as being too likely to betray the uprisingOn his first day on the job the interim prime_minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said he and his cabinet ministers were going to have to take a kamikaze approach immediate and very painful steps to stem a financial meltdownThey have also applied for help from the European_Union and the International Monetary FundPensions have not been paid in full for more_than a month Yatsenyuk told the Ukrainian parliament called the Verkhovna Rada The foreign currency and gold reserves have been ransacked And we are doing everything we can today to stop the situation from deteriorating furtherYanukovych had secured a $15billion bailout from Russia late last_year in exchange for turning his back on the European_Union but Russia has since suspended the program after committing and now writing off $3 billionUkraines new government said Thursday that Yanukovych and his allies had spirited $70billion out of the country illegally since his election to the presidency in 2010Under the terms of last weeks short-lived deal brokered by Poland Germany and France Yanukovych was to have remained in power until new presidential elections could be held in December And a national unity government was to be formed with members from all the major partiesBut Yanukovych absconded hours later and the parliament voted shortly afterward to remove him from office He has since been charged with mass murder in connection with the deaths of nearly 90 people during the protests The government installed Thursday draws only from what had been the opposition parties and this is a factor that Moscow especially objects to The obligation to set_up a national unity government sank into oblivion the Russian Foreign_Ministry said on its Web site Instead as was announced in Maidan a government of winners has been set_up that includes representatives of nationalist extremistsYanukovychs Party of Regions which is now the opposition has repudiated him But he said in his statement Thursday that this was done under duressI officially declare my determination to fight until the end for the implementation of the important compromise agreements concerning the Ukrainian recovery from the profound political crisis Yanukovych saidUkraine has put him on an international wanted list and hopes to send him to the International Criminal Court at The Hague for a trial A new vice prime_minister Vitaly Yarema told the news service RBC-Ukraine that the government would seek Yanukovychs extradition from RussiaHe is no_longer president he is a wanted person who is suspected of mass murder a crime against humanity Yatsenyuk said Russia will almost certainly not send Yanukovych back to Kiev as long as it considers the new government there to be illegitimate But that doesnt_mean that Moscow wants to return him to power said Dmitri Trenin of the Carnegie Moscow CenterThe Kremlin has given up on him Trenin said He is not worthy of being seen as a serious player in UkraineA Russian newspaper and a Ukrainian Web site reported that Yanukovych had been spotted Tuesday_evening in Moscow at the aptly named Ukraine HotelRussian news agencies reported that Yanukovych plans to hold a news_conference Friday afternoon in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don about 40 miles from the Ukrainian border as the crow flies and close to his home base of DonetskInterfax and Itar-Tass both reported that the Moscow government has provided Yanukovych with a security guarantee as long as he is on Russian soil However there has been no_indication whether this pledge of protection could lead to permanent asylum A Russian lawyer told the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper that if Yanukovych were formally accused of murder Russia should extradite himBased on the norms of international law and signed mutual treaties Alexander Treshev said Russia would have to do itIgnoring such obligations would damage Russias image he said William J Burns US deputy secretary of state was in Kiev on Wednesday and Thursday conferring with political leaders and discussing financial helpThe United_States stands with the Ukrainian people at this remarkable moment he said according to the State_Department Web site and we will do all we can to help them build the strong sovereign and democratic country they so richly deserveSuch comments have drawn criticism from Moscow which believes the United_States and other Western nations have inappropriately chosen sides in UkraineRussia urges West to realize responsibility for Ukraines failed peace deal the Foreign_Ministry tweeted Thursday Russia advises everyone to give up provocative statements on UkraineThursday was the first full day of large military preparedness drills in western Russia which will involve 150000 troops Russia has notified NATO that the exercises are not

monitoring and assessing the intentions capabilities and actions of foreign actors it does_not analyze US political processes or US public opinionDirector of National Intelligence James_R Clapper_Jr emphasized this when he testified on Jan 5 Political analysis certainly isnt the purview of the US intelligence_community he saidIn other_words Trump officials are asserting a conclusion that does_not exist in the report because agencies were not asked to make such a conclusion Because the report is silent on the question of whether the election was swayed Trump officials falsely state there is no_evidence that the Russian efforts succeededGiven Trumps narrow election victory just a switch of 40000 votes in three states would have altered the outcome analysts can point to any number of factors Clintons email controversy and the FBI investigation that resulted was certainly a major drag on her electoral prospects But at the same_time during the campaign Trump repeatedly seized on revelations made by WikiLeaks (which US intelligence says came via Russia) to attack ClintonThe answer will never be known but it is not a question that US intelligence was asked to exploreThis is an example of attacking one of the victims the Democratic_National Committee But it ignores the broader implications of the intelligence report how the Russian_government used Internet trolls and RT (Russias state-owned international news channel) to amplify negative reports on Clinton and US democracyThe Internet trolls started to advocate for Trump as early as December 2015 well before the WikiLeaks revelations began to be released on the eve of the Democratic_National ConventionMeanwhile RTs coverage of Secretary Clinton throughout the presidential campaign was consistently negative and focused on her leaked e-mails and accused her of corruption poor physical and mental health and ties to Islamic extremism the report said (It does_not mention that these attack lines mirrored attacks made by the Trump campaign)Again Preibus pins the blame on the DNC But there was a miscommunication between the DNC and the FBIAn FBI special agent tried to contact the DNC in September 2015 but he was transferred to a tech-support contractor on the help desk But after an initial conversation indicating that the FBI had information there was at_least one compromised computer on the DNCsnetwork the contractor did_not return repeated phone_calls thinking he had been the subject of a prank call FBI officials did_not press the issue at higher levels and the urgency of the issue did_not become apparent until months laterJulian Assange who runs WikiLeaks told Fox_News that Clinton campaign_chairman John_Podesta in response to a phishing email for his Gmail account gave out his password as password As our colleagues at PunditFact thats falseFirst of all Google does_not allow users to use the word password as a password So Assange is wrongSecond emails leaked by WikiLeaks indicate that Podestas Windows 8 login was p@ssword Perhaps that is why Preibus was careful to use the word system although from the context of his remarks he seemed to be referring to Podestas Gmail account because that was what the Russians are said to have hacked Just before he mentioned Podestas email he asserted that the reason this particular hack was so large wasnt necessarily because the effort was so great by the Russians It was that it was so easyBut Podestas Gmail accountwas hacked not his Windows 8 computer Podesta was Clintons campaign_chairman and was not associated with the DNCFinally Trump officials like to point to President Obamas actions or inactions after officials accused China of accessing the Office of Personnel Management and obtaining information on 22 million Americans They argue that because Obama sanctioned Russia but not China hes trying to score political points and undercut Trumps victoryThey may have a point but the two situations are not directly comparable The Russian campaign as described by US intelligence involved more_than just hacking with the aim of disrupting and possibly influencing the political process The Chinese hack hada more isolated goal espionage China appears to have wanted the material in order to engage in possible blackmailUS officials also say that China responded to US pressure after the hack was discovered and there are signs its espionage activities have been reduced Timing is often importantin diplomacy China may have been receptive to US pressure at the time because President_Xi Jinpingwas about to visit the United_States and he did_not want the hack to mar the visit China even it had arrested the alleged hackers (Obama that could have been used to issue sanctions against China for the attack)In any case Obama_administration officials say the China case is different because it was purely a case of spying something the United_States does as wellWe did_not retaliate against an act of espionage any more_than other countries necessarily retaliate against us for when we conduct espionage Clapper told lawmakers People who live in glass houses need to think about throwing rocks Because this was an act of espionage and you know we and other nations conduct similar acts of espionage So if were going to punish each_other for acts of espionage thats a different policy issueWhen the United_States a Russian spy ring in 2010 discovering agents who had embedded themselves in US society the spies were arrested and eventually became part of a spy swap between the two countries No sanctions were imposed though that was also during the period when Obama was trying to reset relations with Russia()FBI investigators have a simple reason forJared Kushner can help them determine_whether President Trumps campaign helped Russia influence the presidential_election Kushner met with senior Russians during the campaignAnd while its not weird for presidential campaigns to meet with foreign officials under this context it wasRight around the time Trumps_son-in-law and top adviser held a meeting with the Russian_ambassador to the United_States last spring the CIA_director started to notice something weird The Russians were talking_about actively aggressively trying to influence the US presidential_election against Hillary ClintonJohn Brennan who was CIA_director at the time then started to notice that the Russians were reaching_out to Trump campaign officials His radar went off Heres what he told Congress in a hearing about Russian_meddling on Tuesday Its worth reading the whole paragraph but Ive bolded some key pointsHaving been involved in many counterintelligence cases in the past And so therefore by the time I left office on January 20 I had unresolved questions in my mind as to whether or not the Russians had been successful in getting US persons involved in the campaign or not to work on their behalf again either in a witting or unwitting fashion And so therefore I felt as though the FBI investigation was certainly well-founded and needed to look into those issuesIn other_words When the Russians want to spy or meddle in other nations affairs their go-to move is to find people from that nation to cuddle up with or to blackmail if it gets to that (Suborn sits right in the middle of those two It means to bribe or secretly convince someone to do something) Lookups for suborn are up more_than 28000% Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) When the director of the CIA realized that the Russians wanted to influence the US election he knew to keep an eye out for Russians reaching_out to people tied to the election And sure enough Brennan said Russian officials started holding meetings with members of the Trump campaignMichael Flynn Kushner Now-Attorney General_Jeff Sessions They all met with Russian officials at some point and and the respectivelyhave reported that Sessions and Kushner did_not disclose their meetings with Russians on their security-clearance forms A security clearance is required before a person can be privy to the nations top secrets Other members of Trumps campaign already had deep ties to Russia among them former campaign_manager Paul_Manafort and adviser And its fair to say that US investigators would have been very intrigued to see then-candidate Trumps_son-in-law one of his closest advisers receiving meetings with Russians This is a member of Trumps inner_circle as close as you can get without meeting with the candidate himself Not to mention that Kushner Going back to April_2016 we know Kushner met at_least twice with the Russian_ambassador to the United_States Sergey_Kislyak and a Moscow bankerThats not to say meeting with the Russians equates to colluding with the RussiansBrennan emphasized to theHouse Intelligence_Committee These are contacts that might have been totally totally innocent and benign as well as those that might have succumbed somehow to those Russian effortsMany times they know that individuals may be Russian officials he said later speaking broadly about how Russians use people but they dont_know that there is an intelligence connection or an intelligence motive behind itBrennan made clear that he had only suspected that Russians may have used or tried to use members of the Trump campaign to influence the electionBut and this is a really key but his suspicions were enough to refer everything he knew to the FBIThe FBI we know now took Brennans concerns seriously The agency is waist-deep in a months-long mostly covert investigation of Russia meddling and whether the Trump campaign helped And its investigation has led it to the highest ranks of the White HouseExactly what investigators want to know from Kushner (whose lawyer said he will cooperate) isnt clear But why their investigation has led them to Kushneris clearerGiven what we know about how the Russians try to use people it makes sense that Kushner who had several meetings with high-level Russians and is one of the presidents closest advisers is part of this investigationThomas J Barrack Jr a billionaire who is one of President Trumps oldest friends had spent weeks trying to smooth the way for a May presidential meeting in Saudi_Arabia with Arab leaders of the Persian Gulf All initially went well Trump praised Qatar where Barrack who is Arab American has deep business ties as a crucial strategic partner Then Trump reversed course a few_weeks later and attacked Qatar as a funder of terrorism at a very high level Barrack was taken aback that the president was intervening in a regional dispute So he did what few others in Trumps orbit have done He told the president in effect that he was wrongYou dont need to get involved Barrack said he told Trump The president heeded his friends advice met with the emir of Qatar and in September offered to mediateFew people are closer to Trump than Barrack his friend for three decades Barrack helped rescue Trumps real_estate empire years_ago He was the top fundraiser for Trumps 2016_presidential campaign He turned down a Cabinet offer preferring to be an outside adviser although his name is still mentioned as a potential White_House chief of staff should Trump decide to choose a new one Above all Barrack has remained unfailingly loyal to Trump whom he sees as a shrewd politicianBut even as he remained a close friend and frequent confidant Barrack has also been disappointed by aspects of Trumps performanceBarrack in interviews with The Washington_Post said he has been shocked and stunned by some of the presidents rhetoric and inflammatory tweets He disagrees with some of Trumps proposals including his efforts to ban immigrants from certain Muslim countries and his push for a border wall with Mexico He wonders why his longtime friend spends so much of his time appealing to the fringes of American politicsHe thinks he has to be loyal to his base Barrack said I keep on saying But who is your base You dont have a natural base Your base now is the world and America so you have all these constituencies show them who you really are In my opinion hes better than thisI tell him all the time I dont like the rhetoric Barrack who runs a large real_estate investment company said at his Manhattan office Trumps relationship with Barrack is one of the most_important if little understood of the presidents life offering a case study of what it takes to remain close to him in a time of such turmoilThe men have struck a mutually beneficial deal Trump solicits Barracks advice regularly asking how his actions are playing with the public Barrack listens deferentially advises Trump to change course without fear of retribution and retains a bond that has outlasted Trumps many personal and financial crisesBarrack said he has often thought about how he has remained a close friend for 30 yearswith a man whose reputation is selfish and egotistical Heres what I_think the answer is Ive never needed anything from him I was always subservient to himBarrack said that his life intersected with Trump at soft moments such as discussions about their divorces and children He was at Trumps side during the funeral of Trumps father Fred and they talked for a half-hour about the weight of a hard dad and the baton passing As a result Barrack said he has seen within Trump a kind of compassion at a very lonely levelOut of that has developed a most unusual bond which in turn has enabled Barrack to talk to Trump straight up telling him when he disagrees That has been surprisingly oftenIt is not always fun and no he doesnt come back and say By the way your idea was right or brilliant Barrack saidBut Barrack cant be fired even if his advice doesnt pan out as has happenedIt was Barrack who persuaded Trump to hire political operative Paul_Manafort whom Barrack first met in Beirut 40_years ago for the presidential campaign Trump never publicly criticized Barrack for the advice even as Manafort came under investigation by special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III in a probe examining whether the campaign colluded with RussiaThe 70-year-old Barrack who travels the world by private jet and yachtspeaks in a measured cadence with a diplomatic tone He says he always couches his advice to Trump in an understanding way Others said that Barrack has mastered the art of stroking Trumps ego Either way the two usually talk at_least once a weekBarrack believes that Trump suffers by having too many yes men around him The conclusion is surprising given Trumps penchant for attacking anyone who disagrees with himNo he is very good at being told he is wrong Barrack insisted when pressed on this point People dont have the courage to do it He pushes back hard but the people he respects the most are the people who have the most refined and not wimpy point of viewAs Barracks bluntness and closeness to the president have become better known he is sought as a conduit to Trump for sensitive conversations Ive talked to him about things that Ive thought he would be a good person to talk to the president about said Sen Roy Blunt (R-Mo) who got to know Barrack through their work on the 2017 Presidential Inaugural Committee Tom Barrack has a capacity to disagree that others might not have For_example Blunt said he thought Barrack was the best person to explain to the president that the challenges he is facing arent uniqueBarrack said Trump listens to his and other views curates them and sometimes tells him I love you but if I listened to you Id still be on The Apprentice Trump was born into wealth but Barracks upbringing hardly presaged that he would become a fellow billionaire His paternal grandfather was a Christian migr from a city called Zahleh that at the time was part of Syria and today is within the borders of Lebanon Barracks father ran a small grocery store in Culver City Calif and the family was raised in a modest home in the shadow of MGM StudiosBarrack became a lawyer and his ability to speak Arabic led to an assignment in 1972 to go to Saudi_Arabia to work on a gas deal Barrack played squash with a local Saudi Soon the Saudi brought his brothers It turned_out they were all sons of the king of Saudi_Arabia Barrack spent many hours listening to the Arabs discuss their world which he said gave him great respect for the society and communityThe princes in turn hired him and he became as he put it the American representative of the boysA roommate at Barracks Beirut apartment introduced him to Manafort who represented a firm doing business with a Saudi construction company They became close friends and four decades later Barrack persuaded Trump to hire Manafort for his presidential campaignBarracks success representing the Saudi princes enabled him to buy a California ranch in 1979 just down a hill from Ronald Reagans Rancho del Cielo estate in California The Secret_Service later boarded horses at Barracks ranch and he occasionally went on trail rides and sat around campfires with Reagan I loved him Barrack said of ReaganBarrack first came to national attention in 1982 as a deputy undersecretary to Interior Secretary James Watt a controversial Cabinet member in the Reagan administration who later announced his resignation while at Barracks ranch Later Barrack became entangled in controversy after he gave $70000 to a person who bought the house of Reagan counselor Edwin Meese and then forgave the loan Barrack was called before Congress to answer_questions about whether his Interior appointment was a quid pro quo An independent counsel found that there was no_evidence Meese was aware of Barracks helpThe experience convinced Barrack that he never wanted to serve in public office They kill their own in Washington Barrack said Hired by the wealthy Bass family of Texas in 1987 Barrack received a phone_call to come to Trump_Tower to meet a rising star in New_York real estateDonald Trump wanted to buy a 20_percent share of the Alexanders department store chain owned by the Bass brothers and take over some of the companys real_estate He quickly reached a deal with Barrack to buy the sharesA year later Trump set his sights on the Bass family-owned Plaza Hotel which Trump could see from his office windowYou have the Plaza Trump said according to Barrack I want itBarrack told Trump that the family wanted $410 million for the propertyand Trump surprised him by agreeing to the price in cash Trump later acknowledged that he could never justify the price but said he wanted the trophy property which he later had to give up as a result of a bankruptcy agreementThe sale sealed Barracks reputation as a dealmakerWe then created a great personal friendship Barrack said Our lives went along the same cadence We both got divorced we both had kids the same age we both got remarried and we did different deals togetherWilliam Rogers a Barrack business_partner said Barrack could tell Trump that he was wrong in a way few others could accomplish Donald can be a hard man in his opinions Rogers said Tom had the ability to tell Donald things that he didnt want to hear from other people in a way that Donald would say Thank_you youre my friend and can say it to me and not offend me In 1991 Barrack created his own company Colony Capital which became Colony NorthStar of which he is executive chairman Barrack realized 50 percent profits for the next two years by investing in distressed properties including some bought from the Resolution Trust the quasi-governmental entity that sold off property held by failing financial institutions Trump was struggling with financial problems in 1994 when Barrack was brought in to help A banker with Chase Manhattan Bank called Barrack and told him that Trumps portfolio including a $100 million loan with Chase for a Manhattan development was in trouble Chase called us in Los Angeles and says to Tom Youre the only person who has ever been able to deal with Donald 100_percent and deal with him reasonably Rogers said Would you help us with this Because if he doesnt work with us it is going to be really really bad for himBarrack wanted to help his friend and thought he might invest in the dealHe went on a worldwide search for a backer and got a commitment from several members of the Saudi royal familyTrump ultimately decided to go with investors from Hong_Kong Still Barracks intervention had been crucial persuading Chase not to foreclose and giving Trump time to line up financingThe two remained close Barrack hired Trump to oversee renovation of a Park Avenue property While there are many stories of Trump stiffing or underpaying partners Barrack said he never had such problemsBy 2005 Fortune magazine profiled Barrack as arguably the best real_estate investor on the planet today Barrack told Fortune Im getting out of real_estate deals because the market was ready for a crash Trump was quoted saying Tom has an amazing vision of the future an ability to see whats_going to happen that no one else can matchBarracks prediction proved true As the 2007 financial_crisis pummeled many real_estate investors Barrack bought up discounted property or debt He wound up holding part of the debt on a project controlled by Trumps_son-in-law Jared_Kushner who had purchased a 41-story Fifth Avenue office tower at the height of the market and was having trouble making the loan payments When Kushner tried to restructure his debt meaning some investors would receive less_than expected he flew to California to get Barracks support After Barrack talked with Trump about the matter he went along with Kushners requestAround the same_time Barrack helped Manafort loaning Trumps future campaign_manager $15 million to refinance a home in the Hamptons Barrack said the loan was repaid in 14 months and was the only financial transaction between the two Trump and Barrack began talking_about the presidency as early as 1987 and the talk grew more serious in 1999 I used to tell him people dont understand issues and themes they understand candidates and they look to see what is in the heart and character of the candidate and you are great at that Barrack saidWhen Trump announced his candidacy on June 16 2015 Barrack was shocked by what he saidTrump said Mexico was sending rapists and other criminals to the United_States and that he would build a great wall that Mexico would pay forBarrack thought to himself Oh my God where are we going with this What did he just say Which I continue to say by the way It is shocking to me that he would talk that way because he is not that way Barrack said Mexico and the rest of Latin America needs kisses and hugs from the president not divisive attacks He suggests that Trump change his motto from Make America Great Again to a more continental theme of Make the Americas Great Again Another stunning moment for Barrack came when Trump in December 2015 for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United_States until authorities can figure out what the hell is going onBarrack said Trump was trying to pressure Muslim-dominant countries to root out terrorists within their midst Still he said that Trumps ban is one of the things that hit me the hardest because it is the most complexBarracks ancestry fueled his concern He had often visited Zahleh the mountain city that his grandfather emigrated from in 1900 The area now houses strings of settlements of Syrian refugees many of whom barely subsist More than 1 million Syrians have taken shelter in the country of 6 million peopleBarrack visited Zahleh in May 2016 as Trumps proposed Muslim ban continued to dominate campaign coverageLuciano Calestini who at the time was deputy representative of UNICEF-Lebanon took Barrack on a tour of several refugee settlements He had a chance to walk around talk to refugees and think what it would have been like to grow up there Calestini said in a telephone interview He reflected on how easily that could have been him if his grandfather hadnt moved with no job and destined for a life of just scraping byBarrack speaking about the visit said he thought about how his grandparents had fled the same area amid sectarian and political strife and how little had changed for those unlucky enough to be refugeesBarrack said he frequently talked to Trump about the proposed Muslim ban seeking to explain_why the Muslim ban could go over badly in the regionThe president always viewed me as one of the few Arab American friends that he has Barrack said Im telling him Look Islam is the fastest-growing religion in the world You got 2billion Muslims If young Muslims cant find jobs they may turn to terrorism he told Trump Barrack supported Trumps campaign and shortly_after Trump lost the Iowa caucuses he reconnected with his old friend Manafort a longtime Republican consultantI really need to get to Trump Manafort said according to Barrack He told Barrack he wanted to work as Trumps convention manager helping him navigate what they expected would be a contentious affairBarrack who had long been friendly with Kushner as well as Trumps daughter_Ivanka said he wrote them an emailurging Trump to hire ManafortManafort soon became part of the campaigns inner_circle rising to become chairman He joined Kushner and Donald Trump Jr in a meeting with a Russian lawyer who was said to have damaging_information about Hillary_Clinton The meeting is now a focus of Muellers investigation_into whether Russia colluded with the Trump campaign which all involved in the meeting have deniedManafort resigned in August after reports of his ties to Ukraines former president He belatedly under the Foreign_Agents Registration_Act saying his company had been paid $17 million Manaforts complicated financial affairs brought him under intense scrutiny including an early morning FBI raid at his home in Virginia Muellers office and Manafort declined to commentBarrack said he has not been contacted by the Office of Special Counsel or congressional investigatorsBarrack meanwhile stood by Manafort He invited Manafort to accompany him off the coast of Greece on his yacht He got fired and I felt terrible Barrack said When Manafort called he was depressed I said I have got five guys on a boat and Join us He came over and he spent four or five days figuring out what he would do nextThat loyalty has continued Barrack hired Manaforts business_partner Rick_Gates as deputy chairman of the Presidential Inaugural Committee and then as director of the Washington office of Colony NorthStar Gates declined to comment Days after Barrack returned from visiting the refugee settlements in Lebanon he turned his attention to giving Trumps campaign financial help Trump had first promised to finance his own campaign But that vow was dropped and Barrack brought in $7million at a fundraising dinner at his palatial home in Santa Monica Then in June_2016 Barrack helped found a political action committee Rebuilding America Now which raised $23million After the election Barrack served as chairman of Trumps inaugural committee raising more_than $100 million nearly twice as much as President_Barack Obamas record 2009 haul of $53millionBarrack sees it as logical that raising a lot of money could translate into a job offer and that is what happenedYeah I raised the most money for him Barrack said The inauguration in itself was over $100million that we had to raise from scratch So of course he said Would you like Treasury What would you like to do Barrack said he told the president he would prefer to be an outsider Privately he would be the low-profile Trump whisperer and publicly the Trump explainerIn my communities the financial community the media community the entertainment community they really dont like him in a visceral way Barrack said So to the extent that I can try to bridge a tolerance I_think I can help him the most Barrack insisted that Americans are starting to witness Trump change He is learning to govern deal with the Democrats building constituenciesAs Trump began his presidency Barrack saw an opportunity to help reshape Middle_East policy which was one of Kushners many assignments Barrack reached out to his friends in the Persian Gulf some of whom had been put off by Trumps campaign rhetoric about Muslims and tried to assure them that they could work with the presidentI tell them I know him personally at a very intimate level and the truth is his passion and his compassion and his empathy for them is true and is deep Barrack said even as he acknowledged that drawing these hard lines from 6000 miles away may seem harsh Barracks Arab dealmaking has for years fueled his business focused on three countries Saudi_Arabia the United Arab_Emirates and Qatar Hes done significant business with all of them raising the question of whether that could influence his advice to Trump on Persian Gulf issuesHe worked with Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal the chief_executive of a Saudi investment company to buy the Fairmont Hotel chain Royal family members in the United Arab_Emirates partnered with him in the Kerzner International hotel company which operates a luxurious hotel called Atlantis The Palm in DubaiSome of Barracks most recent and significant investments have been with funds connected to Qatars royal_family In 2010 he worked with partners including the Qatar Investment Authority to buy the Miramax film studio for $660million and was named chairman The purchase brought Barrack full circle from his modest upbringing in the shadow of MGM Studios He became one of the first studio heads to license content to Netflix a strategy that he said enabled him to sell Miramax to Qatari investors for four times what he paid for itIn 2012 a company affiliated with Barracks firm sold property on Italys Sardinian coast to Qatars sovereign wealth fund which is controlled by the emir and the royal_family Italian officials later launched an investigation_into whether the transaction had been arranged to avoid paying $190 million in taxes Barrack who has not been charged with wrongdoing has denied avoiding taxes A Luxembourg entity that handled the transaction for Barracks company has paid a settlement of 22million euros Barrack tried to use his Qatar connection to help Kushner who was for the redevelopment of 666 Fifth Avenue the troubled 41-story office tower Barrack had once invested in Barrack said he told the former prime_minister of Qatar to consider investing in the Kushner Cos property but the deal never happenedAt the same_time the Arab nations have poured their sovereign wealth into the investment funds run by Barracks company Barrack declined to provide specifics Barracks relationships have been complicated by tensions among the Persian Gulf nations Saudi_Arabia and the United Arab_Emirates have led the effort to break relations with Qatar and impose an embargo for its alleged terrorism ties Qatar which hosts a US military base with 10000 American military personnel says it is a staunch US allyBarrack stressed he is not picking one friend over the other It should be clear that I am friends and have been partners with all three of these Middle_East countries at issue Barrack said Barracks most public effort to influence policy came in a pre-election Fortune in which he called for the United_States to back a Marshall Plan that would aid the poor and said there must be a radical shift in [US] outreach toward the Arab world Barrack introduced Kushner to Yousef al-Otaiba the influential UAE ambassador to the United_States and the two have spoken regularly Otaiba declined to commentBarrack said he sees no conflict raised by his business_dealings and his advice to Trump saying he is just trying to be an honest individual that has a lot of experience in the region and that he would not risk his reputation by trying to use his ties to Trump for financial gain My objective is to just try and create a tapestry in which all three of them weave a solution Barrack saidDana Shell Smith the US ambassador to Qatar from 2014 to June of this year said Tom Barrack is perhaps one of the only people in the world who understands the parties well enough and knows all of them well enough including our administration to help bring an end to the crisisNotwithstanding the success of Barrack and his administration allies in modulating Trumps view Saudi_Arabia and the United Arab_Emirates continue to impose their blockade of Qatar and the crisis continues Alice_Crites contributed to this reportLeaders of a historic in Alexandria have decided to remove a pair of plaques from its sanctuary that memorialize two of their most prominent parishioners George Washington and Robert_E Lee In a letter sent Thursday to members of the Christ Church congregation church leaders explained that the decision came after much deliberation This was not a discussion we entered into lightly but rather a sincere attempt to have a family conversation about our worship space our larger history and our future they wrote The fate of the two plaques which have hung on either side of the altar at the historic church since 1870 had been talked about for years according to the Rev Noelle York-Simmons the churchs rector But the matter took on added urgency following events in Charlottesville One person was killed and several injured Aug 12 after a rally by white_nationalists protesting the planned removal of a statue of Lee While recognizing the important roles both Washington and Lee played in the nations history church leaders wrote that the decision was made that it would be best to remove them because they create a distraction in our worship space and may create an obstacle to our identity as a welcoming church and an impediment to our growth and to full community with our neighborsNews of the churchs decision was first reported by the website York-Simmons and other church leaders spent much of September discussing the matter with members of the 1800-person congregation York-Simmons characterized the meetings and listening sessions as hearteningPeople responded beautifully and faithfully listening in a lot of ways that showed our church at its best she saidYork-Simmons would not discuss whether there were parishioners who advocated for keeping the plaques Im not going to speak for my parishioners We have been through an intense process of listening to our communitys thoughts on all sides of the complicated issue she saidThe nations first president and the commander of the Confederate army both played significant roles in the early history of Christ Church Washington was a regular worshiper Lee and his family were also parishioners Mary Custis Lee Robert_E Lees wife gifted the church $10000 to help begin its endowmentEven though much of the recent national debate has centered around Civil_War memorials church leaders said they thought that it was important for the plaques to be considered together They noted that both were placed at the same_time and visually balance each_other in a way that maintains the symmetry of the churchs sanctuary We understand that both Washington and Lee lived in times much different than our own and that each man in addition to his public persona was a complicated human being and like all of us a child of God church leaders wroteChrist Church founded in 1773 is not the only congregation to struggle with how to balance their legacy with shifting views about historical figures After two years of tense debate an Episcopal parish in Lexington Va named for Lee who was once a prominent member its name York-Simmons said the plaques will remain in place until a new location for them is identified some time next year A committee will be formed to deliberate on a new place of respectful prominence While some may criticize the churchs decision York-Simmons emphasized that this is not about changing the past but about finding a way to place the churchs history in the proper context We are deeply committed to our history but even more we are deeply committed to the worship of Jesus Christ she said The question is how can we reflect bothThe House on Thursday passed a bill introduced by Rep Barbara Comstock (R-Va) that would expand the authority of the federal government to deport or detain non-citizen immigrants who are gang_members or suspected of gang activityThe legislation offered as a response to an increase in killings perpetuated by the resurgent MS-13_gang in the Washington region and nationally would allow officials to take action against suspected gang_members regardless of whether theyve been convicted of a crimeThe bill was slammed by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the American Civil Liberties Union which argued it would promote racial profiling erode due process and unintentionally affect others such as clergy who try to help gang membersThe was approved 233 to 175 It drew opposition from the four Democrats who serve alongside Comstock in the Virginia delegation Rep Don Beyer (D-Va) whose district borders Comstocks spoke against it on the House floor Six of the seven Republicans in the delegation voted in support Rep Thomas Garrett did_not cast a ballotAlthough the bill is unlikely to pass the Senate in its current form that President Trumps advisers would recommend he sign it as isThe bill is in keeping with a strategy used by Comstock who is seeking reelection in 2018 to a third term to focus on local issues important to her suburban Northern_Virginia district such as crime and transportationThe approach helped her keep her seat last_year while sharing a ballot with President Trump who lost her district by 10 pointsDemocrats and Republicans say Comstocks district could be among the most competitive in the 2018 midterm elections which are expected to be a referendum on TrumpThe presidents unpopularity in the district which stretches from the Washington suburbs to rural counties along the West Virginia border and is anchored by Loudoun County motivated eight Democrats to seek the party nomination to challenge the congresswomanComstock has said she wants to continue work done by her predecessor longtime congressman Frank Wolf to combat gang violenceIn a speech on the House floor Thursday she said the bill will ensure that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can act immediately when they identify a known MS-13_gang memberWe dont have to wait until these brutal killers wield their machete or leave a body on a childrens playground she said referring to the November 2015 murder of a man whose He died of stab wounds to the head and neckSince November 2016 Comstock said authorities have tied at_least eight murders in Northern_Virginia to MS-13 and the Northern_Virginia Regional Gang Task Force believes as many as 4000 gang_members live in the Washington region Comstocks bill was sponsored by Rep Bob Goodlatte (R-Va) chairman of the House Judiciary_Committee Rep Peter T King (R-NY) and Rep Ral R Labrador (R-Idaho) who spoke in favor of itGoodlatte said whether immigrants are here illegally or have visas or permanent resident status it is time to send the message that this behavior simply will not be toleratedKing said MS-13 had turned his district into killing fields where 17 young people have been murdered by gang_members in the past_year and a half The New_York City Police Department and the Sergeants Benevolent Association endorsed the bill he saidWe cannot allow gang_members to be taking advantage of loopholes in our immigration laws King saidDemocrats speaking against the bill said they agreed there must be a way to curtail MS-13 but Comstocks bill would have unintended consequences and face legal challenges We all agree MS-13 is a problem and I_think shed be better served by working in a bipartisan manner to find a responsible solution rather_than doing something on her own thats probably dead on arrival in the Senate Beyer said after the voteImmigrant advocates objected to the bill saying it would give law_enforcement wide latitude in designating groups of people as gangs and seeking to deport detain or block their asylum before a crime has been committedThis feels just like yet_another barely thinly veiled attempt to criminalize and demonize immigrants in order to justify what this administration has consistently promoted as their commitment to a massive deportation regime said Avideh Moussavian a senior policy attorney at the National Immigration Law CenterShe called it a shameful slapping of labels on immigrants to justify infractions of due process and human rightsLawmakers debated the bill on Capitol Hillof a Wednesday_night dinner over which they discussed a deal to potentially protect dreamers undocumented_immigrants brought to this country as children Rep Luis V Gutirrez (D-Ill) said congressional Democrats should not accept amnesty for the dreamers in exchange for new restrictions on immigrants as described in Comstocks billI am committed to not exchanging the safety of dreamers for more deportations or further restricting legal immigration so that there are no available legal avenues for immigrants who help feed us build our communities and

the reasons as far as anyonecan tell that President Trumphas blocked people on TwitterAmid for the president of the United_States to bar exchanges with certain constituents on his preferred platform of communication a group of people has stepped into the spotlight those who have been #BlockedByTrumpThe latest targets may be a veterans group and the author Stephen King who has already attracted celebrity sympathyTrump has blocked me from reading his tweets I may have to kill myself Stephen King (@StephenKing) In the 24 hours before his alleged blocking the writerhad tweeted about and the Trump Cabinets for their president Kinghad previously mocked Trumps baseless wiretapping allegations as only a couldFor many getting singled out on Twitter by the leader of the free world is so bizarre that when it happens there tends to be a sense of awe mixed with indignation and disbelief For others it has become a strange new badge of honor with newly blocked users by previously blocked onesWelcome to the blocked club I brought cake Holly OReilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) The club may now also include VoteVetsorg a liberal veterans group whichshared what it claims is a screenshot of its block notificationThe Commander in Chief can block the voice of 500k military veterans and families but we will NOT be silenced VoteVets (@votevets) The group posted to Facebook the tweets itposted in reply to the presidents recent tweets which criticized Trumps travel restrictions the Russia controversy and moreThe Commander in Chief can block VoteVetsorg on Twitter the voice of 500000 military veterans and families but we will NOT be silencedPosted by onThe alleged blocking has provoked a response from criticsSad that our draft deferring Commander in Chief is unwilling to hear the voice for over 500000 veterans Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) Has someone created a Tweets by Donald Trump acct that would immediately post his tweets for & all to see Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) Will Fischer VoteVets director of government relations told Voxcom that blocking the organization on Twitter is not just being unresponsive to veterans but about being responsive to any voice of dissent whatsoeverIts difficult to say for certain how many people Trump has blocked because a userslist of blocked accounts isnt public (This report relied on screen shots from those who said they had been blocked)But it is an experience that a growing number of people say they shareHOLY [S] HE ACTUALLY DID IT Jules Suzdaltsev a freelance_journalist based in San Francisco accompanied by screen shots of Trumps suddenly inaccessible (to him) personal Twitter account I told Trump to spend more time with his son AND HE BLOCKED MESuzdaltsev was caught off guard when what he considered a fairly harmless series of tweetsfinally spurred Trump to block him Usually acritic of the president Suzdaltsev saidhe had started out by affirming Trumps opinion that and agreeing that her joke was tasteless and stupidHe then followed with some unsolicited advice for Trump to spend more time with his youngest son BarronAlso and I mean this sincerely you NEED to spend more time with Barron instead of golfing every single weekend Jules Suzdaltsev (@jules_su) I mean Jesus take him golfing WITH you It seriously breaks my heart what youre doing to Barron he is the only Trump I like Jules Suzdaltsev (@jules_su) And just like that Trumps Twitter feed was suddenly closed off to SuzdaltsevI was elated he told The Washington_Post Maybe initially bittersweet but when I realized I could still reply I was absolutely elatedSuzdaltsev certainly wasnt trying to get himself blocked by the president but he wasnt holding back either He had been tweeting at Trump regularly since just before the inauguration often with over-the-top aggressive missives that challenged Trumps intelligence his appearance and more Often Suzdaltsev says he couldnt help himselfFirst of all hes incredibly easy to respond to Suzdaltsev said Other times hell say things that are vividly untrue Its almost like theres this compulsion to prove that Youre not fooling anyone I dont care if youre the president This is the stupidest thing Ive ever heard anyone say By then Suzdaltsev had become one of a vocal group of verified Twitter users who relished in racing to be the first to comment anytime Trump tweeted The overwhelming number of retweets and likes he got for each retort if phrased and timed just right had become entertaining gratifying and yes a little addictiveIt did amazing things for my engagement he saidEventually it also got him blockedBut in late May word spreadthat after she tweeted at @realDonaldTrump to say that his trip to the Middle_East had been embarrassingOH MY EFFING GODThe President of the United_States just blocked me on Twitter because I hurt his feelings Bess Kalb (@bessbell) I thought oh thats quite unsettling because I never expected that that would happen and Id always been a little afraid of that Suzdaltsev said of Kalb getting blocked But I sort of thought Im not going to change because thats the definition of a chilling effectFor Rob Szczerba a tech executive in Upstate New_York who rarely tweeted about anything political before Trump it was the post-inauguration spat over crowd size that sucked him into the Twitter gameYoure just thinking toyourselfWhy would you get all bent out of shape about that Szczerba told The_Post That just seems kind of sillyLike Suzdaltsev Szczerba got into the habit of trying to come up with rapid humorous responses to Trumps tweets He set_up his notifications to alert him whenever Trump posted to Twitter And like others his replies to the president were usuallymet with hundreds if not thousands of likes and retweetsIf you promise not to release any classified_information on your trip youll get an extra scoop of ice cream at dinner Rob Szczerba (@RJSzczerba) Usually theyre fairly blunt Szczerba said of the presidents tweets I never really tweeted anything threatening or use profanity in any way I tried to use humorEven that was not enough to prevent Trump from hitting the block button on him On the night of June 1 the same_day Trump announced that the United_States would be withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement Szczerba fired off a criticism of the decision in the form of a dad jokeI heard is a new flavor from Ben & Jerrys But its mostly just nuts Rob Szczerba (@RJSzczerba) When he checked Trumps profile shortly afterward he realized he had been blockedI was almost laughing when I got blocked Szczerba said Like seriously what youre blocking me overSzczerba said he doesnt know whether Trump himself is doing the blocking or whether its someone on his staff Either way he thinks its counterproductive For one there are still ways through third-party apps to view and respond to a Twitter account that has blocked youWhen youre blocked it shows that someones actually reading these things and somebodys gotten under your skin Szczerba said As a politician responding in this sort of manner doesnt_seem to be in your best interestOther last tweets to Trump that reportedly triggered a presidential block include disses of Trumps approval ratings even calls for his impeachmentUNBLOCK ME YOU COWARD Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) LOLwelcome to the club He blocked me TWO years_ago because I called him a cartoon character MacKenzie L (@run_mac_run) Trump Blocked me on Twitter For Saying He Doesnt Care About Our Grandchildren Aunt Crabby (@DearAuntCrabby) PS looking at the date this was probably the one that caused him to block me Tara Dublin (@taradublinrocks) This was my last tweet to Trump before he BLOCKED me Holly OReilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) Did I make death threats against him Did I use foul language or threaten his family Holly OReilly aka @AynRandPaulRyan wrote in a of None of the aboveI told him that the pope looked at him funny OReilly saidAt first she couldnt help but laugh at the absurdity of it all but soon her laughter gave way to anger she wroteIts one thing if the president blocks me Im just one person and I can certainly do something else with those five_minutes of my day But when he began systematically blocking dozens of people who simply didnt agree with him thats when I started to worry that this is something more_than just one person blocking another one This is an elected official trying to silence an entire sector of the dissenting populace This is what dictators and fascists do This isnt what we do here in AmericaOReilly has since joined a group that is alleging that Trumps blocking of her on Twitter violates her First Amendment rights Trump is not the only elected officialwho has been blocking his or her constituents on Twitter With the writer King its unclear if he was actually blocked (Maybe its a hoax he tweeted) Kingcould not be reached immediately for comment Buthe has drawn a Thanks Maybe its a hoax Im good either way Ill always have Pence hahahaha Stephen King (@StephenKing) For many others being blocked by Trump is a less serious matter something to trumpet in Twitter bios and reminisce about with Its kind of viewed as a little_bit of a badge of honor that you got blocked Szczerba saidTwitter user Tony Posnanski is just one of a few who turned his notification that Trump had blocked him into his Being blocked by Donald Trump is the new verified life is lit rn you guys Jules Suzdaltsev (@jules_su)The troopsthat recently recaptured Palmyra Syria from the Islamic_State included Syrian Iranian and Hezbollah forces And onMonday Russian officials there was another group that contributed to the victory Russias elite special_forces also known as SpetsnazRussian troops are nothing new to the Syrian ground war Since their arrival in September the Russians have used naval infantry to secure a key port in Tartus and the perimeter of an airfield in Latakia But Russian special_forces operating on the front aside from a small number of artillery and tank units have remained mostly out of the public eyePosted by onWith the seizure of Palmyra though that is no_longer the case Russian officialsannounced Monday that Palmyra was liberated with participation of Spetsnaz and military advisers The Islamic_State took Palmyra in May and shortly afterpartially destroyed a number of the citys historic sitesRussian special_forces have come to the forefront of Russias Syria narrativebecause the battle for Palmyra plays directly into the anti-Islamic State rhetoricthat Russia used as a pretense to initially intervene said Chris Kozak a research analyst at the Institute of the Study of War Involvement of Russian special_forces in Palmyra looks great Kozak said Whereas their involvement against opposition groups in Aleppo or Latakia doesnt fit the narrativeIt is unclear exactly when Russian special_forces began operating in Syria though prior to Russias_intervention there Russian troops hadlong helped adviseand trainSyrian forces According to Michael Kofmanan analyst at CNA who focuses on Russian military operations Russia currently operates several special_forces units in Syria Zaslon KSO and detachments of reconnaissance teamsPart of the Russias Foreign_Intelligence Service Zaslon is a highly secretive detachment often responsible for security in high-threatareas KSO is Russias equivalent to the USJoint Special_Operations Command and was formedwithin the past fewyearsRussian special_forces are doing a lot of the targeting for Russian airstrikes and a lot of advising for the Syrians Kofman said adding that they provide most of the intelligence on the ground for Russian airpower and helprun Syrian operationsUnlike the majority of US special_forces that are currentlyadvising Iraqi and Syrian forces from behind the lines at the battalion and brigade levels Russian special_forces appear to beparticipating in combat alongside Syrian troops at the tactical levelThe presence of Russian special_forces and advisers on the front line has in turnhelpedSyrian troops and President Bashar al-Assads allies consolidate gains and take ground acrossthe country According to Kofman Russian military advisers on the grounddespite the hype surrounding the detachment of Russianaircraft in the country arethe glue that is helping the Syrians fight as a much more capable army Its really hard to make that much of a difference with suchfew planes even_though they have flown at a very high rate Kofman saidRussia has played a significant role inAssads attempts to reverse almost half a decade of losses to opposition groups Jabhat al-Nusra and the Islamic_State Yet in recent months Iranian troops Hezbollah forces and a slew of militias have also significantly bolstered the fledgling Syrian army as wellBut Russias involvement in ground operations has not been without its cost Just days prior to Russias announcement that Spetsnaz forces helped liberate Palmyra the Interfax news_agency quoted an unnamed Russian official who said aspecial forces soldier died heroically after calling airstrikes ontohis own position after he was surrounded by the Islamic_State Following the announcement of the soldiers death the story went Much like itsintervention in Ukraine Russia has been slow the deaths of any of troops in Syria usually acknowledging them months after the deaths To date Russia has acknowledged the deaths of seven Russian service_members in Syria According to Kofman Russia has been more open to announcing deaths in the fight for Palmyra The deaths he said reinforce the image that Russia is primarily operating in Syria to defeat the Islamic StateStill there is a limit to the opennessThe Russian_government has not disclosed the total number of casualties in the fight to retake PalmyraIn recent_weeks the Islamic_State claimed to have killed a number of Russian special_forces soldiers In one instance a news_agency associated with the extremist group posted what appeared to be the gear belonging to a Russian special_forces soldier In that instance the soldiers gear featureda number of items including an that could havebelonged to a special forcessoldierThe Islamic_State also posted pictures supposedly from that soldiers phone showing images of the dead soldier and members of hisunit It is unclear whetherthe equipment and the photosare from the same soldier as that the soldiers from theunit pictured on the phone belongto a contracting group not Russian special forcesFirst Facebook wanted you to like things Then Facebook gave you an array of emotions wow haha love sad and angry Choose an emotion instead of just a like and your friends get a better sense of how you feel about their posts But doing so also tells Facebook something about youAnd that is one big reason Ben Grosser an artist and a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who describes his work as writing software in order to investigate the social effects of software made an extension that randomizes what you tell Facebook about how youre feeling Its called and Ill be honest it made Facebook likes a little terrifying for me when I first installed itHeres how it works With Go_Rando running each time you click like on a post from your news feed the extension intercepts that like and randomly selects one of Facebooks six reactions That reaction is what shows up on the post Click like and you might end up loving the post Click like on another post and it might show up as sadWith Go_Rando running I clicked like on a post from a friend who was passing along a list of job openings at hisworkplace My reaction showed up as sad I was angry about a romantic Valentines Day post from one of my closest friends Thankfully like any like on Facebook Go_Rando likes let you unlike as well And if you want to pick your reaction for say a more sensitive post from a friend the extension will let you do that in exactly the same way that you choose an emotion on Facebook without the extension getting involved But Go_Rando works closest to Grossers intentions when you interfere with it the least The idea is essentially that all those random emotionsconfuse the data you give Facebook By creating random reactions to the posts you like you stop telling Facebook how you genuinely feel With enough use youll appear more or less balanced to the site Grosser said in an interviewIt disrupts the usefulness of this emotional reaction data that Facebook is collecting he said It disconnects how we feel from the data thats getting recorded No longer will my emotions line up neatly with easy analytic pictures of my personality Over time as you use Go_Rando instead of creating a picture of Oh he likes those things Oh he hates those things instead its going to look like Im neutralGrosser uses the term emotional surveillance to talk about what Go_Rando is supposed to confound Emotional surveillance meansusing our activity online to ascertain how we feel and to connect how we feel with our interests our hopes our fears in order to more effectively analyze our personalities he said And that sort of personality analysis is useful for the purposes of message targeting predictive analytics and a bunch of other thingsAs of last_year in its news feed but it has also made it clear in the past that it intends to use it for this purpose some time in the future Facebook said it had no updates on its use of reactions data in the News Feed when we reached out this weekWe already know that Facebook is interested in how you feel and that likes in general are a driving force behind the algorithms that determine what you see in your news feed The very purposeof the like button as is to enlist its users in solving the problem of how best to filter their own news feeds without even thinking about itFor Grosser thats a phenomenon worth examining How we feel or how we report how we feel on Facebook has all kinds of implications for what we see in the future on Facebook Grosser told me By randomizing what you report to the site youre essentially telling Facebook that you feel each available emotion about the same number of times and not necessarily for the same sorts of posts One day for instance you might love a post containing a link to a news story that is critical of President Trump The next_day you might be angry at a similar thingFacebooks previous interest in emotional manipulation is one reason Grosser decided to create a project examining these reactions In2014 Facebook revealed that it had run a highly controversial study on a subset of its users It manipulated what they saw on their news feeds showing some users more positive posts than normal and showing others more negative posts Then Facebook used keywords from those users status updates to determine their overall mood (The study in case you were interested found that the users who saw more positive posts had more positive status updates and that those who saw more negative posts had more negative updates You can )Grossers work is generally based on a simple concept adding to or removing a normal part of an online experience to make you think about why its there in the first place He made another Facebook-based extension for instance that removes all the numbers from the platform Thebecame the subject of a research paper by Grosser that highlighted the worrying importance quantification plays in feeding our addiction to social_media Go_Rando is also in that vein The app contains an element of chaotic fun (and a bit of mild social danger) but its also designed to make you think about how you react on Facebook in the first place and who benefits from you doing it Liking has become a compulsive behavior Grosser said Go_Rando makes you pause The things you tell Facebook tell the company about you But they also tell any advertisers political campaigns anyone who might want to target a particular demographic with a message or product things about you too And as a reward for all that useful knowledge Facebook gives the user a feed thats designed to display things that will keep them sharing liking and loving That feed can easily become a bubble that shows you the world as youd like to see it as opposed to the world as it isAlthough Go_Rando still tells Facebook that you reacted to something at allconfusing random emotions or not my short experience using it definitely helped me pause each time to think about whyIn the final hours of the 2017 Maryland legislative session five male senators tried to hash out an agreement on a bill that would allow a woman who becomes pregnant during a rape to terminate the attackers parental_rights At least 21 other states have adopted similar laws But in Annapolis the bill failed for the ninth time in as many years with key members of a conference committee panel balking at the idea of terminating rights if the alleged rapist has not been criminally convicted This time the bills defeat and triggered an outcry from advocates The two committee chairmen who appointed the conference panel were blasted for waiting until the very end of the 90-day legislative session and for not including any women in the groupThe criticism in some ways has overshadowed what advocates describe as victories on other bills that address the way rape is prosecuted and the options available to survivors of sexual assaultThis was an important year for rape crisis centers for rape survivors I dont_want that to be lost on the demise of this bill said Del Kathleen M Dumais (D-Montgomery) sponsor of the parent rights legislationThere is a much stronger awareness of the victims of sexual_assault and a better sensitivity to the issue overall she said Its happening nationally and Im glad to see it happening in MarylandAfter two failed attempts more_than a decade_ago Maryland lawmakers this year passed a bill which says no_evidence of physical resistance is needed to prove sexual_assault The General Assembly also approved a measure that by including all nonconsensual sexual violations and eliminating any reference to gender And it passed bills increasing the amount of time have to sue their abusers and requiring law_enforcement to preserve the evidence in rape kits for 20 yearsLisae Jordan the executive director of the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault said advocates made substantial progress for sexual_assault survivors during the recent sessionDel Shelly L Hettleman (D-Baltimore County) who sponsored the bill to preserve rape kits said she pushed for a statewide standard after showed a huge disparity in how long the kits were preserved Some law_enforcement agencies kept the evidence forever while others destroyed it after nine monthsHaving the preservation of this material gives some of the decision-making power back to the survivor Hettleman said by giving rape victims more time to decide whether to file charges The no means no bill was necessary advocates say because police and prosecutors were not adhering to a 2010 state Court of Appeals rulingthat a victim saying no and pushing an assailants hand away was enough to meet the states force or threat of force requirement for proving sexual_assault Under the new statute that force or threat of force threshold no_longer existsAdvocates say the threshold is one reason of law_enforcement officials declaring rape allegations unfounded An audit last_year showed that one-third of cases closed as unfounded in the county between 2013 and 2015 were categorized that way after victims told police they had not fought their attackers There is a clear cultural shift between 2004 when the no means no bill was originally introduced and this year Jordan said This year many said that absolutely should be law There was no similar shift however among legislative leaders charged with deciding the fate of the paternity-rights legislationThe primary reason according to advocates of the bill and those are skeptical of it lies in the differences between civil andcriminal courtCivil procedure is looked at differently Dumais said Thats where there is still some misunderstanding I_guess is the softer way to characterize it There is a mistrust of the civil systemUnder the bill a woman who sought to terminate a mans parental_rights would have to prove through clear and convincing evidence the standard used in civil court that the man had sexually assaulted her The burden-of-proof standard is higher in criminal courtwhere charges must be proved beyond a reasonable doubtSen Robert A Zirkin (D-Baltimore County) chairman of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee said he was troubled with the idea of a man potentially losing his parental_rights without being convicted of sexual assaultIts a complicated bill Zirkin said There are protections in criminal law that do not apply in civil casesBut advocates argue that the state allows parental_rights to be terminated in child-abuse cases even when there is no criminal child-abuse conviction The same standard should apply they say in cases of sexual_assault They also say that most rape cases go unreported and unprosecuted If the bill applied only to convicted rapists victims who chose not to file criminal_charges would not be able to terminate the parental_rights of their attackersAdvocates say women rarely seek to terminate an attackers parental_rights even in states that have laws allowing them to do so easily Jordan said she suspects that victims who become pregnant as a result of an assault instead choose to abort or go into hiding She said if the bill had passed she would expect more women in Maryland to try to terminate the parental_rights of their assailants by taking legal actionThe House unanimously passed the rights-termination bill on March 9 The Senate did_not take up the measure until April 6 five days before the end of session The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee struck language from the bill that said that courts could not require publication of the name of the mother or child and added language that said the father could refuse to testify or offer evidence in courtThose changes meant that a conference committee composed of delegates and senators from the committees that had first considered the bills would have to negotiate final wording that could then be taken up again by the full House and SenateZirkin appointed himself Sen William C Smith Jr (D-Montgomery) and Sen Michael J Hough (R-Frederick) to the conference committee passing over the two female lawmakers on the judicial proceedings panelZirkin declined to say why he did_not place Sen Delores G Kelly (D-Baltimore County) or Sen Susan C Lee (D-Montgomery) on the panel Instead he noted that Smith was a co-sponsor of the bill and one of the strongest advocates for it on his committeeThat doesnt_mean that you shouldnt have women on a conference committee discussing rape and pregnancy Jordan said Del Joseph F Vallario Jr (D-Prince Georges) chairman of the House Judiciary_Committee waited until late afternoon on the final day of the legislative session to name himself Del David Moon (D-Montgomery) and Del Brett R Wilson (R-Washington County) to the conference committee He was absent when the group finally convened at 10 pm two hours before the legislature would adjournVallario who voted for the original version of the bill when it passed the House did_not respond to repeated requests for comment for this article He told the Baltimore Sun that the makeup of the committee was coincidentalMoon a strong proponent of the legislation said he thought the panel was set_up for an impossible challengelacking enough time and commitment from members to resolve differences between the House and Senate bills and get the legislation back to each chamber for a vote Dumais said she doesnt think the makeup of the panel defeated the bill given the support from Moon Smith and WilsonStill she said said Zirkin and Vallario should have included women in the groupThe optics of an all-male panel are horrible in the year 2017 Moon said It was politically tone-deafThe controversy over President Trumps treatment of fallen service_members escalated Monday its eighth straight day when the grieving widow of one of four US soldiers killed in Niger and described how the presidents blunders on his condolence call left her angry and in tearsThough Trump insisted he had been very respectful the widow Myeshia Johnson said on ABCs Good Morning America that Trump told her that her_husband knew what he signed up for but it hurts anyway She said the presidents comments made me cry because I was very angry at the tone of his voiceJohnson said that Trump did most of the speaking on their call which occurred last Tuesday and that he did_not seem to remember the name of her_husband Army Sgt La_David Johnson who was killed in Niger on Oct 4 under circumstances that military officials have not fully explainedI heard him stumbling on trying to remember my husbands name Johnson told ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos And thats what hurt me the most because if my husband is out here fighting for our_country and he risked his life for our_country why cant you remember his name And thats what made me upset and cry even more because my husband was an awesome soldierTrump rejected Johnsons account about an hour after the interview was broadcast I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt La_David Johnson and spoke his name from beginning without hesitationTrump ignored questions about the issue shouted by reporters later in the dayThe fight pitting the commander in chiefs words against those of the pregnant widow of a fallen soldier as well as those of Rep Frederica S Wilson (D-Fla) a friend of the Johnson family who has detailed and sharply criticized Trumps handling of the condolence call has distracted from the administrations agendaThe episode has also threatened to stain the credibility of White_House Chief of Staff_John F_Kelly a retired Marine Corps general who lost one of his sons in the war in Afghanistan and who had been viewed by many in Washington as a key moral authority in the administrationWere cruising toward a war with North_Korea and for eight days weve watched inane behavior by the president Congresswoman Wilson and the chattering class in Washington retired four-star Army general Barry McCaffrey said It really makes me sick to be honest Im sure his phone_call with the widow was absolutely disastrous He wings stuff He doesnt have any empathy But I_think theres a larger issue What are we doing hereReflecting on the past eight days McCaffrey added Im starting to wonder if the countrys losing its moorings The drama began last Monday with a falsehood by Trump A reporter asked him during a news_conference why he had been silent for 12 days about in Niger the deadliest combat incident since he took_office Trump responded defensively falsely asserting that his predecessors including President_Barack Obama never or rarely called family members of service_members who were killed on their watch In fact they regularly didTrumps actions since then have followed a careful formula that he long ago devised for winning a skirmish and that has been described by senior White_House advisers Make it a fight use controversy to elevate the message and never apologizeThe conflict bears all the hallmarks of a typical Trump rumble over-broad boasts inconsistent official accounts tweeted name-calling partisan attacks aides ensnared in controversy and a steady effort to pin the blame for the whole hullabaloo on the news mediaTrump grew up in a New_York PR and media environment of Page Six beefing and gossiping so he looks at his whole life through that window said Rick Wilson a Republican strategist and a vocal Trump critic His philosophy of always fighting back is morally divorced from any other situation And to stay in Trumps good graces his aides have to play that gameTrumps treatment of the Johnson family and his mockery of Wilson have reopened wounds with African Americans many of whom see a pattern of racial prejudice by this president noting his past attacks on ESPN sportscaster former national_security adviser and other black women We are sick and tired of women being undermined being dismissed and black women in particular Rep Maxine Waters (D-Calif) a longtime member of the Congressional Black Caucus as she defended Wilsons integrity Brittany Packnett an activist affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement that Trumps treatment of Johnson is representative of something bigger Donald Trump doesnt respect black women In a drama that has inflamed Americans on both_sides of the political spectrum Trump and Kelly disregarded Washington conventions of civility personal reputation and fidelity to factWithout Trumps rules of engagement the bungled effort to soothe a mourning widow could easily have been resolved with a simple statement of clarification from the president But Trump chose otherwise and Kelly followed him into the breach along with White_House press_secretary Sarah_Huckabee SandersInitially lost in the fireworks was Johnson the widow whose feelings had been channeled by Cowanda Jones-Johnson the soldiers aunt who raised him as a son and Wilson a longtime family friend Both women were in a limo with Johnson driving to meet her husbands body when Trump called and they overheard the conversation on speakerphone Trump initially denied Wilsons account of the call as a total fabrication even_though Kelly later confirmed that he had coached Trump to say roughly what Wilson said he told Johnson and repeatedly attacked the lawmaker as wacky He tweeted that attention on her was killing the Democrat PartyKelly labeled Wilson an empty barrel and accused her of political grandstanding by that she had inappropriately claimed credit in a 2015 speech for securing funding for a federal building Video of the event shows that Wilson did no such thing and the congresswoman has called on Kelly to for what she termed character assassinationEighteen women from the Congressional Black Caucus demanded an apology from Kelly on Sunday Wilsons integrity and credibility should not be challenged or undermined by such blatant lies their statement readFor her part Sanders amped up the attacks on Wilson by saying the congresswoman was all hat no cattle an apparent swipe at Wilsons habit of wearing colorful sequined cowboy hats Sanders refused to apologize for or correct Kellys false claim about Wilson and she scolded reporters for fact-checking the chief of staff Questioning a four-star general she said was In close adherence to the Trump rules the president and his aides escalated the fight welcomed the controversy and refused to apologize And it might have worked more effectively had the whole enterprise not ended with the president in a standoff with a mourning widowOn Monday Johnson for the first time spoke for herself on the issue saying Wilsons account of her call with Trump was 100_percent correctWhy would we fabricate something like that Johnson told StephanopoulosAsked if there was anything she wanted to say to Trump Johnson replied No I dont have nothing to say to him Kristine Phillips and Eugene Scott contributed to this reportDonald Trump was in his element mingling with beauty pageant contestants and business tycoons as he brought his Miss_Universe pageant to Russia for a much-anticipated Moscow debut Nonetheless Trump was especially eager for the presence of another honored guest Russian President_Vladimir PutinTrump tweeted Putin a personal invitation to attend the pageant and a one-on-one meeting between the New_York businessman and the Russian leader was scheduled for the day before the showPutin canceled at the last minute but he sent a decorative lacquered box a traditional Russian gift and a warm note according to Aras_Agalarov a Moscow billionaire who served as a liaison between Trump and the Russian leaderStill the weekend was fruitful for Trump He received a portion of the $14million paid by Agalarov and other investors to bring the pageant to Moscow Agalarov said he and Trump signed an agreement to build a Trump_Tower in the heart of Moscow at_least Trumps fifth attempt at such a venture And Trump seemed energized by his interactions with Russias financial elite at the pageant and a glitzy after-party in a Moscow nightclubAlmost all of the oligarchs were in the room Trump bragged to Real Estate Weekly upon returning homeTrumps relationship with Putin and his warm views toward Russia which began in the 1980s when the country was still part of the Soviet_Union have emerged as one of the more curious aspects of his presidential campaign The overwhelming consensus among American political and national_security leaders has held that Putin is a pariah who disregards human_rights and has violated international norms in seeking to regain influence and territory in the former Soviet bloc In 2012 one year before Trump brought his beauty pageant to Moscow then-Republican presidential_nominee Mitt Romney called Russia the United_States top geopolitical threat an assessment that has only gained currency since thenTrump has conveyed a different view informed in part through his business ambitions Since the 1980s Trump and his family members have made numerous trips to Moscow in search of business opportunities and they have relied on Russian investors to buy their properties around the worldRussians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets Trumps son Donald Jr told a real_estate conference in 2008 according to an account posted on the website of eTurboNews a trade publication We see a lot of money pouring in from RussiaThe dynamic illustrates the extent to which Trumps worldview has been formed through the lens of commerce rather_than the think tanks government deliberations and international diplomatic conferences that typically shape the foreign_policy positions of presidential candidatesIt also reflects Trumps willingness to see world leaders through his own personal connections In a Republican_Party in which an ability to stand up to Putin has been seen as a test of toughness Trumps relationship with the Russian leader is instead one of mutual flattery Putin said

force seen as the chief protector of pro-Western nations near Russia And Trump has surrounded himself with a team of advisers who have had financial ties to Russia This account of Trumps 30-year history of business with Russia and that of his advisers is based on interviews as well as a review of deposition transcripts and other court_records in which Trump and his associates have discussed their overseas work Trump declined to be interviewed for this article as did top campaign aides and most members of his foreign_policy team The Kremlin also declined to comment about Trumps visit to MoscowThe coming together of Trumps business and political agendas was evident during his 2013 Moscow trip in which he was seeking deals at the same_time he was starting to ponder a presidential runAgalarov and his son Russian pop musician Emin_Agalarov told The Washington_Post that they befriended Trump after the pageant and listened as he described his views of US-Russia relationsHe kept saying Every time there is friction between United_States and Russia its bad for both countries For the people to benefit this should be fixed We should be friends Emin_Agalarov recalledRussia has signaled a deep interest in the US election and in Trump in particular The Russian_ambassador to the United_States breaking from a tradition in which diplomats steer clear of domestic politics

and the Soviet_Union began to open more to outsidersRussia is one of the hottest places in the world for investment Trump said in a 2007 deposition We will be in Moscow at some point he promisedPart of the allure was what Trump and his associates saw as a huge opportunity the chance to market American-style luxury apartments to the wealthy elite in a place that still mostly offered utilitarian Soviet-style constructionThe Russian market had natural strength especially in the high-end sector said Donald Trump Jr in his 2008 real_estate conference speech Moscow held special appeal because wealthy people throughout the region wanted to own real_estate in the capital city he saidTrumps 1987 trip represented his first public exploration of business prospects in Moscow He went with his then-wife Ivana to scope out sites for luxury hotels he hoped to build in a joint venture with the Kremlins hotel and tourism agency according to Trumps memoir which was published the same yearThe project never got off the ground an outcome that would repeat itself multiple times between then and his 2013 tripIn 1996 Trump tried to partner with US tobacco executives to build a luxury

claimed in a later court proceeding that Russian investors were spooked when a 2005 book questioned his net worthBut the Russia quest continued In his 2008 speech Donald Jr announced that he had traveled to Russia six times in the previous 18months But he said Russia presented enormous challengesAs much as we want to take our business over there Russia is just a different world the younger

Sullivan and Steven Mufson contributed to this reportA delivered to President Obama and President-elect Donald Trump last_week included a section summarizing allegations that Russian intelligence services have compromising_material and information on Trumps personal life and finances US officials saidThe officials said that US intelligence_agencies have not corroborated those allegations but believed that the sources involved in the reporting were credible enough to warrant inclusion of their claims in the on Russian_interference in the presidential campaignTrump however replied Tuesday night with a tweet declaring FAKE_NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT Early Wednesday the intelligence_community of taking one last shot at meIn Moscow the Kremlin called the report an Spokesman Dmitry_Peskov told_reporters that its dissemination was an evident attempt to damage our bilateral relations A senior US official with access to the document said that the allegations were presented at_least in part to underscore that Russia appeared to have collected embarrassing information on both major candidates but released only material that might harm Democratic_nominee Hillary_Clinton a reflection of Russian motivation that bolstered US spy_agencies conclusion that Moscow sought to help Trump winThe inclusion of such unsubstantiated allegations in the election report a development first reported Tuesday by CNN adds a disturbing new dimension to existing concerns about Russias efforts to undermine American democracy And it adds another bizarre twist to an already strange election year injecting new controversy over the Trump teams relations with Russia just when the president-elect is trying to consolidate and launch his new administration If true the information suggests that Moscow has assembled damaging_information known in espionage circles by the Russian term kompromat that conceivably could be used to coerce the next occupant of the White_House The claims were presented in a two-page summary attached to the full report an addendum that also included allegations of ongoing contact between members of Trumps inner_circle and representatives of MoscowThe Russian Embassy did_not respond to a request for comment Tuesday night Officials in Moscow this week dismissed the intelligence report on Russian_interference in the election and the spokesman for Russian President_Vladimir Putin said its accusations have no substanceUS officials said the claims about Russian possession of compromising_material were based not on information obtained through traditional intelligence channels but research done by an outside entity engaged in political consulting work and led by a former high-ranking British_intelligence official The material was first mentioned in a Mother Jones report in OctoberUS officials said that while the FBI had so_far not confirmed the accuracy of the claims US officials had evaluated the sources relied upon by the private firm considered them credible and determined that it was plausible that they would have firsthand knowledge of Russias alleged dossier on TrumpThe CIA the FBI and the White_House declined to comment on the matterAfter CNNs report Tuesday Sen_Jeff Sessions_(R-Ala) Trumps nominee to be the next attorney_general was asked at his confirmation_hearing about the allegations in the intelligence report If its true its obviously extremely serious Sen Al Franken (D-Minn) said after reading from the CNN report And if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian_government in the course of this campaign what will you doSessions responded that he was not aware of any of those activities While saying he had not spoken to Trump about the reports he said allegations get made about candidates all the time and theyve been made about President-elect Trump a lot Dossiers compiled by the former_British intelligence official have been circulating in Washington for months Several news_organizations including The Washington_Post have been attempting to confirm many of the specific allegations without successOne US official said that Trump was briefed on the allegations because they were already circulating widely and it was mostly a courtesy to let him know they were out thereCompiled initially in mid-2016 and supplemented during and after the campaign the reports include detailed allegations that the Russians hold compromising_material about Trump some of it obtained while Trump visited Moscow in 2013 for the Miss_Universe pageant and on a previous visit to Russia Other reports compiled by the former intelligence official allege contacts_between Trump personnel and business officials and Russian officials during the campaign The former intelligence official was at one point paid to explore Trumps ties to Russia by anti-Trump Republicans and later by supporters of the Democratic PartyIf I was the Clinton campaign I would be reaching_out to these people who put together the dossier and Id ask for my money back Trump_Organization Executive Vice_President Michael_Cohen told The Washington_Post last_week Its wrong Theres_no accuracy Theres not an ounce of validity to anything that exists in that fileLast month Sen John_McCain (R-Ariz) who had been provided with the information personally delivered it to FBI_Director James_B Comey In a statement early Wednesday McCain said that upon examination of the contents and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy his only involvement in the issue was to hand the information over to authoritiesA source familiar_with the matter said the FBI had it well before then and had interviewed the former intelligence official last fall Clintons former campaign spokesman Brian_Fallon appealed for a congressional inquiry Mitch McConnell you must let a Select Committee investigate these allegations as @SenJohnMcCain has been urging for weeks Fallon wrote on TwitterKT McFarland Trumps designated national_security adviser declined to respond to a question about the report I dont_know about the story that youre

nothing but Im_going to refrain Im not going to say what Donald Trump thinks about the election and what involvement the Russians had I_think Id just say what [Director of National Intelligence James_R Clapper Jr] said which is that nothing the Russians did had any effect on the outcome Clapper however testified that the report never attempted to assess what effect the Russian intervention had on the election resultThe two-page summary was attached to the most highly classified of three versions of the report on Russian election interference that were circulated in Washington last_week including an abbreviated declassified draft that was made publicIt was unclear_whether the claims in the summary were even considered by FBI CIA and DNI analysts who were responsible for the main body of the report or whether the information from the outside group had any influence on those analysts conclusionsSenior lawmakers who were briefed on the most classified version of the report declined to comment Rep_Devin Nunes_(R-Calif) the chairman of the House_Intelligence Committee and a member of the Trump transition_team said that we cant comment on what goes on in classified briefings but he added that the idea that Moscow would seek to gather incendiary material on US leaders should not be a surprise to anyoneThe Russians are always looking for dirt on any politician Nunes said That

answer_questions from senators Tuesday about his private conversations with President Trump including whether he spoke to Trump about former FBI_director James_B Comeys_handling of the investigation_into possible_coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016_presidential raceIn a number of testy exchanges with members of the Senate_Intelligence Committee Sessions said he would not answer many of their questions because of a long-standing Justice_Department policy that he said protects private conversations between Cabinet secretaries and the presidentThe attorney_general confirmed elements of before the same panel last_week while disputing others Sessions said he was in an Oval_Office meeting in February with Comey and Trump when the president said he wanted to speak to Comey privately and he acknowledged that Comey came to talk to him the next_day about the meetingAt other times though Sessions frequently said he couldnt recall specifics particularly when asked about his meetings with Russian officials during the 2016 campaignAbove all Sessions who served as a senator from Alabama before taking the attorney_general post tried to clear his name and win the sympathy of his former colleaguesHe opened his testimony with a fiery assertion that he never had any conversations with Russians about any type of interference in the 2016_presidential electionI was your colleague in this body for 20 years Sessions said The suggestion that I participated in any collusion is an appalling and detestable lieThe attorney_general seemed to understand the import of each of his words as the highest-ranking Trump administration official so_far to testify publicly on the FBI investigation and Comeys_firing During one line of questioning by Sen Kamala D Harris (D-Calif) he told her in a flash of anger not to rush his answers because youll accuse me of lying and said she was making him nervousSessions took particular aim at news reports about a possible meeting he had with a Russian official during an April_2016 event at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington where Trump gave a pro-Russia speech He acknowledged being at the event and said he had conversations with people there but did_not remember any conversations with Russian_Ambassador Sergey KislyakIf any brief interaction occurred in passing with the Russian_ambassador during that reception I do not remember it Sessions saidHe said that he had met twice with Kislyak once during the Republican_National Convention and once in his Senate office and that he during his confirmation_hearing He said however that he did_not remember any other meetings with Russian officials during the 2016_presidential campaign and did_not remember any conversations with Russian officials about the Trump campaignCertainly not one thing happened that was improper in any one of those meetings Sessions saidWhen asked to explain_why he wrongly claimed in his confirmation_hearing that he never_met with Russians Sessions said he was flustered by the question from Sen Al Franken (D-Minn) after many hours of testimonyThe attorney_general has since from the Russia investigation a decision he sought to cast Tuesday as resulting from his role as an adviser on the Trump campaign rather_than because of any inappropriate interaction with Russian officialsI recused myself from any investigation_into the campaigns for president but I did_not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations he saidBut Sessionss answers seemed to contradict each_other at times particularly when it came to his recusalA March 2 email by Sessionss chief of staff said that he would not be involved in any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for the president of the United_States Yet two months later he played a direct role in Trumps decision to fire_Comey citing Comeys_handling of the Hillary_Clinton email investigation during the 2016 raceThe recusal involved one case in the Department of Justice and the FBI said Sessions referring to the FBIs Russia investigation and offering a different description of the scope of his recusal Im the attorney_general of the United_States Its my responsibility to ensure that the department is run properly I do not believe it is a sound position that if you recuse from a single case you cant make a decision about the leadership of that agencySessions previously told senators explicitly that he would recuse_himself from matters related to Clinton though Justice_Department spokeswoman_Sarah Isgur_Flores said Tuesday that the case was already closed and therefore not part of the recusalWhen asked about his conversation with Comey on the day the president spoke to Comey alone Sessions described the exchange differently than the former FBI chief did in his testimony last weekComey testified that after what he called a disturbing private talk with Trump he went to Sessions Without telling the attorney_general that Trump had suggested the FBI drop its probe of former national_security adviser_Michael Flynn Comey told Sessions It cant happen that you get kicked out of the room and the president talks to me The president has denied asking Comey to drop the Flynn matterComey said that the attorney_general didnt say anything but that Sessionss body language gave him the sense that he was powerless to do anythingSessions said he did respond telling Comey that the FBI and the Department of Justice needed to be careful to follow department policies regarding appropriate contact with the White HouseSen Ron Wyden (D-Ore) suggested that the attorney_general was ducking critical questions in his testimonyI believe the American people have had it with stonewalling Americans dont_want to hear that answers to relevant questions are privileged or off limits Wyden said We are talking_about an attack on our democratic institutions and stonewalling of any kind is unacceptableSessions shot back I am not stonewalling I am following the historic policies of the Department of JusticeWyden noted that Comey had said it was problematic for Sessions to oversee the Russia probe for reasons he did_not explain in a public settingSessions became angry again when Wyden pressed him to explain what facts might be problematic about his involvement in the probeWhy dont you tell me There are none Senator Wyden There are none Sessions said This is a secret innuendo being leaked out there about me and I dont appreciate itEarlier Tuesday Deputy_Attorney General_Rod J_Rosenstein appeared before lawmakers on the Senate Appropriations Committee He responded to questions regarding comments Monday from Christopher Ruddy the chief_executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of Trump that Mueller was recently appointed to lead the investigation_into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 electionRosenstein said that if the president ordered him to fire Mueller he would comply only if the request was lawful and appropriateRosenstein who has been on the job for six weeks said only he could fire Mueller and only if he found good cause to do so He described Mueller as operating independently from the Justice_Department in his investigation Julie_Tate and Karoun

Thats the experience of current and former senior US officials who on Saturday expressed disbelief at leveled without any evidence that President_Barack Obama had the candidate wiretapped at Trump_Tower before the November election Senior officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because such matters are classified said that there had been no wiretap on TrumpUnder the law governing foreign-intelligence surveillance inside the United_States an FBI agent would need to show a federal_judge that there is probable_cause that the target is an agent of a foreign power and that requires more_than just talking to say the Russian ambassadorBoth criminal and foreign intelligence wiretaps have onerous and strict processes of approval that require not only multiple levels of internal Justice_Department review but also require court review and approval said Matthew Waxman an expert on national_security law at Columbia UniversityThe law authorizing wiretaps in terrorism and espionage cases is known as the Foreign_Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 passed out of reforms recommended by a select Senate committee called the Church Committee in the wake of spying abuses by the FBI and the National_Security AgencyThe law bars targeted electronic surveillance on US soil unless the government can show that the target was a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power and that the facility the phone number or email address in question is being used by the foreign power or agentThe law authorizing criminal intercepts in cases such as murder drug dealing or racketeering is Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 Like FISA the law requires probable_cause but in this instance that the target is about to or has committed a crimeIn a national_security case the FBI working with attorneys in the Justice_Departments National_Security Division prepare a declaration laying out their grounds for seeking a FISA order A senior intelligence official typically the FBI or CIA_director must certify that the purpose is to collect foreign intelligence and that the information cannot be obtained by normal investigative meansThen the package must be approved by a senior Justice official Only three have authority to approve the order the attorney_general the deputy attorney_general and the head of the National_Security DivisionAn NSD attorney would then present the application to made up of 11 federal district judges appointed by the chief justice of the United_States They sit in rotation one judge at a time typically for a week The courts proceedings are highly classified and generally the court hears only the governments side of the caseFollowing the revelations of widespread NSA surveillance by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowdenor public advocate whom the judge can ask to weigh in on significant interpretations of FISAFISA orders rarely are rejected in part because lawyers will withdraw or amend an order if a judge signals it will not pass muster Once approved the order is served on the phone or Internet company that handles the number or email address in questionOn average in recent_years there have been about 1400 to 2300 FISA orders a year Each order can contain multiple names and numbers or email addressesIn a criminal case a federal_prosecutor goes before a US district judge and presents an application for a Title III order In 2015 according to the Administrative Office of the US Courts there were 1400 wiretap orders covering one or more devices Some experts though citing phone company transparency reports say the offices number appears lowIn the old days FBI_agents would attach alligator clips to phone lines Today a technician at a phone company will type into a computer system the number or email address digitally creating another line that goes to an FBI listening post The FBI has separate facilities for criminal wiretaps and national_security intercepts The latter are generally recorded for transcription Criminal wiretaps are listened to in real time Under Title III if an agent hears a target talking to someone not involved in the crime like a pizza deliverer he or she is required to hang up Under FISA any information that does_not have foreign intelligence value must be minimized or masked in the transcript That includes the names of US citizens who are picked_up speaking to the target unless their identities are relevant to understanding the foreign intelligence In a typical counterintelligence investigation if an agent is trying to figure out a targets network conversations even those that might appear innocuous at first are more likely to be considered relevant Thus the minimization rules for national-security wiretaps are more lenient than those for criminal wiretaps because spies and terrorists generally use more sophisticated tradecraft to evade surveillanceThe communications of people who are speaking to the target are termed incidental The FBI for instance routinely wiretaps the foreign embassies of major adversaries such as China and Russia including intercepting the cellphone conversations of senior diplomats Anyone speaking to any of these targets would have their conversations picked_up as incidental collectionIt is possible some former officials said that there may be recordings of phone conversations between someone in Trump_Tower and a Russian official or officials If so the most_likely explanation is that the surveillance was being conducted on the Russian officials who historically have been under court-authorized FISA surveillance Those talking to the target would have had their conversations picked_up as incidental collectionJustice Department ethics_experts have concluded that newly appointed special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III can oversee the investigation_into possible_coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin during the 2016_presidential election even_though his former law_firm represents several people who could be caught up in the matter authorities announced TuesdayIn an email Justice_Department spokeswoman_Sarah Isgur_Flores said ethics officials had reviewed the case and determined that Mr Muellers participation in the matters assigned to him is appropriate She said the officials had considered Muellers professional obligations and those imposed by government ethics regulations Mueller a former FBI_director had worked for the past three years in the Washington office of WilmerHale a prominent law_firm whose lawyers represent President Trumps former campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort Trumps daughter_Ivanka and the presidents son-in-law_Jared Kushner Mueller resigned from the firm after to oversee the investigation of Russian_meddling in the

fled Sri Lanka decades agoBefore anything else I was an immigrant and proud daughter of schoolteachers she told an audience of about three dozen including her_husband National Wildlife Federation chief_executive Collin OMara and their infant daughterShe said as governor she would push for mandatory paid family leave for new mothers and fathers and for universal prekindergarten and make education her top priorityVignarajah 37 has said she is driven to run partly by the retirement early this year of US Sen Barbara A Mikulski (D-Md) which left all statewide elected offices in Maryland filled by men for the first time in many yearsA graduate of Yale University and Yale Law School Vignarajah lives in Gaithersburg and worked for Michelle Obama for a little more_than two years after a stint as a senior adviser at the State_Department She previously worked at a New York-based consulting_firm and a Chicago-based law_firm and has taught at Georgetown UniversityVignarajah who was nine

DistrictVignarajah did_not take questions Tuesday and declined to comment on her eligibility for officeThe Trump administrations decision to on Monday gave the event a suddenly high profile with protesters outside media inside and angry lawmakers and academics criticizing the moveThis type of political interference or scientific censorship whatever you want to call it is ill-advised and does a real disservice to the American public and public_health Sen Jack Reed (D) Rhode Islands senior senator said at an opening news_conference for the State of Narragansett Bay and Its Watershed event in Providence We can debate the issues We can have different viewpoints But we should all be able to objectively examine the data and look at the evidenceReed was joined Monday by the rest of the states congressional delegation all of them Democrats who took turns chastising the Environmental Protection_Agency for instructing twoof its scientists and one contractor not to speak at the conference MondayThe elephant in the room is its almost impossible to imagine this sequence of events Rep David N Cicilline said at Mondays event calling the scientists involved deeply respected and the report itself thoroughlyvetted The idea that we would deny the American people information good reliable facts and evidence to develop good public policy is not only disappointing itsdangerousRepJim Langevin echoed that sentiment We have got to get beyond this point of stifling science of muzzling good science and speak to the facts as they are he said This shouldnt be about a Democratic or Republican issue Its about protecting the planetOutside a small_group of protesters gathered wearing tape over their mouths and holding handmade signs Denial is not a policy read one Un-gag science read anotherThe EPA has offered little explanation for the decision to prevent the scientists from participating other than to say in a statement that they were allowed to attend the event but not present because it is not an EPA conferenceMondays conference marked the culmination of a three-year report on the status of Narragansett Bay New Englands largest estuary and the challenges it faces Climate change features as a significant factor in the500-page report which evaluates 24 aspects of the bay and its larger watershed But organizers said the broader point of Mondays official release of the report was to highlight the improved water quality of the bay in recent decades a success story they say is due in large part to the states partnership with the EPA and its scientistsFor about six years the EPA has provided about $600000 annually for each of more_than two dozen national estuaries including the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program the conferences hostThe programs director Tom Borden saidthat the head of the EPAs National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory Atlantic Ecology Division informed him Friday that the keynote speaker division research ecologist Autumn Oczkowski and another colleague in the lab Rose Martin would not be able to make presentations at the eventI was not given a clear reason why Borden said in an_interview Sunday adding that his team had worked closely with several of the agencys scientists on protecting and restoring the bay Its a terrific partnership to have EPA working with usAn EPA contractor who had contributed to two chapters of the report Emily Shumchenia also was told not to speak at the event She and Martin were slated to take part in a panel titled The Present and Future Biological Implications of Climate ChangeThe estuary report which was subject to extensive peer review and public comment charts how Narragansett Bay is becoming cleaner but also faces such challenges as nutrient runoff and climate changeThe public complaints Monday came not only from lawmakers but also from those involved in the report and from veterans of the work of improving the quality of Narragansett BayThe irony is an effort to squelch the participation from EPA I_think just highlights the importance of science as the basis for our work and commits us even more vigorously to promoting science said Janet Coit director of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental ManagementJohn King a University of Rhode Island oceanography professor who chairs the science advisory committee of the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program said the EPAs decision had unwisely politicized the science underlying Mondays report and that it would have been completely irresponsible not to examine the potential effects that climate_change will have on the bayWhat Id say to [EPA] Administrator [Scott] Pruitt is our job is to inform policy Hopefully it becomes good policy King told the assembled crowd Let us do our job without fear of losing our jobs I_hope in thatspirit we can move_forward from what has occurredLess than two_weeks before Donald Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination his campaign_chairman offered to provide briefings on the race to a Russian billionaire closely aligned with the Kremlin according to people_familiar with the discussionsPaul Manafort made the offer in an email to an overseas intermediary asking that a message be sent to Oleg_Deripaska an aluminum_magnate with whom Manafort had done business in the past these people saidIf he needs private briefings we can accommodate Manafort wrote in the July 7 2016 email portions of which were read to The Washington_Post along with other Manafort correspondence from that timeThe emails are among tens of thousands of documents that have been turned over to congressional_investigators and special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_IIIs team as they probe whether Trump associates coordinated with Russia as part of Moscows efforts to interfere in the 2016 US electionThere is no_evidence in the documents showing that Deripaska received Manaforts offer or that any briefings took_place And a spokeswoman for Deripaska dismissed the email exchanges as scheming by consultants in the notorious beltway bandit industryNonetheless investigators believe that the exchanges which reflect Manaforts willingness to profit from his prominent role alongside Trump created a potential opening for Russian interests at the highest level of a US presidential campaign according to people_familiar with the probe Those people like others interviewed for this story spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss matters under investigationSeveral of the exchanges which took_place between Manafort and a Kiev-based employee of his international political consulting practice focused on money that Manafort believed he was owed by Eastern European clientsThe notes appear to be written in deliberately vague terms with Manafort and his longtime employee Konstantin Kilimnik never explicitly mentioning Deripaska by name But investigators believe that key passages refer to Deripaska who is referenced in some places by his initials OVD according to people_familiar with the emails One email uses black caviar a Russian delicacy in what investigators believe is a veiled reference to payments Manafort hoped to receive from former clientsIn one April exchange days after Trump named Manafort as a campaign strategist Manafort referred to his positive press and growing reputation and asked How do we use to get whole Manafort spokesman_Jason Maloni said Wednesday that the email exchanges reflected an innocuous effort to collect past debtsIts no secret Mr Manafort was owed money by past clients Maloni saidMaloni said that no briefings with Deripaska ever took_place but that in his email Manafort was offering what would have been a routine briefing on the state of the campaignVera Kurochkina a spokeswoman for Rusal the company led by Deripaska on Wednesday derided inquiries from The_Post that she said veer into manufactured questions so grossly false and insinuating that I am concerned even responding to these fake connotations provides them the patina of realityCollectively the thousands of emails present a complex picture For_example an email_exchange from May shows Manafort rejecting a proposal from an unpaid campaign adviser that Trump travel abroad to meet with top Russian leaders We_need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips Manafort wrote according to an email read to The PostThe email exchanges with Kilimnik add to an already perilous legal situation for Manafort whose real_estate dealings and overseas bank_accounts are of intense interest for Mueller and congressional_investigators as part of their examination of Russias 2016 efforts People close to Manafort believe Muellers goal is to force the former campaign_chairman to flip on his former Trump associates and provide informationIn August Muellers office executed a search_warrant during an early-morning raid of Manaforts Alexandria_Va condominium an unusually aggressive step in a white-collar criminal matterMueller has also summoned Maloni the Manafort spokesman and Manaforts former lawyer to answer_questions in front of a grand_jury Last month Muellers_team told Manafort and his attorneys that they believed they could pursue criminal_charges against him and urged him to cooperate in the probe by providing information about other members of the campaign The New_York Times reported this week that prosecutors had threatened Manafort with indictmentThe emails now under review by investigators and described to The_Post could provide prosecutors with additional leverage Kilimnik did_not respond to requests for comment A spokesman for Mueller declined to commentDeripaska one of Russias richest men is widely seen as an important ally of President_Vladimir Putin A US diplomatic cable from 2006 published by WikiLeaks referred to Deripaska as among the 2-3 oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basisThe billionaire has struggled to get visas to travel to the United_States because of concerns he might have ties to organized crime in Russia according to the Wall_Street Journal He has vigorously denied any criminal tiesRussian officials have frequently raised the visa matter over the years with US diplomats according to former US officials familiar_with the appealsIn 2008 one of Manaforts business partners Rick Davis arranged for Deripaska to meet then-presidential candidate John_McCain at an international economic conference in SwitzerlandAt the time Davis was on leave from Manaforts firm and was serving as McCains campaign_manager The meeting caused a stir given McCains longtime criticism of Putins leadershipThe Post_reported in 2008 that Deripaska jointly emailed Davis and Manafort after the meeting to thank them for setting it up Davis did_not respond Wednesday to a request for commentAt the time of the McCain meeting Manafort was working in Ukraine advising a Russia-friendly political party He ultimately helped to elect Viktor_Yanukovych as president in 2010 In 2014 Yanukovych was ousted from office during street protests and fled to MoscowManafort and Deripaska have both confirmed that they had a business relationship in which Manafort was paid as an investment consultant In 2014 Deripaska accused Manafort in a Cayman Islands court of taking nearly $19million intended for investments and then failing to account for the funds return them or respond to numerous inquiries about exactly how the money was used There are no signs in court_documents that the case has been closed The emails under review by investigators also show that Manafort waved off questions within the campaign about his international dealings according to people_familiar with the correspondenceManafort wrote in an April_2016 email to Trump press aide Hope Hicks that she should disregard a list of questions from The_Post about his relationships with Deripaska and a Ukrainian businessman according to people_familiar with the emailWhen another news organization asked questions in June Manafort wrote Hicks that he never had any ties to the Russian_government according to people_familiar with the emailHicks now the White_House communications director declined to commentFormer campaign officials said that Manafort frequently told his campaign colleagues that assertions made about him by the press were specious They also privately shared concerns about whether Manafort was always putting the candidates interests firstThe emails turned over to investigators show that Manafort remained in regular contact with Kilimnik his longtime employee in Kiev throughout his five-month tenure at the Trump campaignKilimnik a Soviet army veteran had worked for Manafort in his Kiev political consulting operation since 2005 Kilimnik began as an office manager and translator and attained a larger role with Manafort working as a liaison to Deripaska and others people_familiar with his work have saidPeople close to Manafort told The_Post that he and Kilimnik used coded language as a precaution because they were transmitting sensitive information internationally In late July eight days after Trump delivered his GOP nomination acceptance speech in Cleveland Kilimnik wrote Manafort with an update according to people_familiar with the email exchangeKilimnik wrote in the July 29 email that he had met that day with the person who gave you the biggest black caviar jar several years_ago according to the people_familiar with the exchange Kilimnik said it would take some time to discuss the long caviar story and the two agreed to meet in New YorkInvestigators believe that the reference to the pricey Russian luxury item may have been a reference to Manaforts past lucrative relationship with Deripaska according to people_familiar with the probe Others familiar_with the exchange say it may be a reference to Ukrainian business titans with whom Manafort had done business Kilimnik and Manafort have previously confirmed that they were in contact during the campaign including meeting twice in person once in May 2016 as Manaforts role in Trumps campaign was expanding and again in August about two_weeks before Manafort resigned amid questions about his work in UkraineThe August meeting is the one the two_men arranged during the emails now under examination by investigatorsThat encounter took_place at the Grand Havana Club an upscale cigar bar in Manhattan Kilimnik has said the two discussed unpaid bills and current news But he said the sessions were

Oleg_Deripaska is ashrewd self-made billionairewho hasmanaged to stay on the right side ofpower whether by marrying into the family ofRussias first president Boris Yeltsin or by making himself indispensable toits current one Vladimir PutinAs my Washington-based colleagues reported this week former Trump campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort allegedly offered to provide Deripaska 49 with about the 2016 presidentialelection lessthan two_weeks before Trump accepted the Republican nomination The emailed offer said to have been sent to a Russian colleague of Manaforts is among tens of thousands of documents that have been turned over to investigators possible collusion_between Trump associates and Russia as part of an effort by the Kremlin to interfere in the 2016 US election It is unclear_whether such an offer reached Deripaska and a spokesman for the businessman denied that it did But Manaforts apparent readiness to share information with an oligarch known to be part of a trusted circleof businessmen near Putin is one of the most concrete revelations to emerge from the probe into Trumps Russia linksDeripaskas relationship with Manafort began in the mid-2000s when Manafort was a consultant for a Ukraine-based oligarch Rinat Akhmetov an associate of oustedpresident Viktor_Yanukovych The Associated_Press in March that Manafort signed a $10 million annual contract with Deripaska in 2005 a report that Deripaska denied and later against the AP In 2008 Rick_Gates a partner of Manaforts wrote in a memo that Deripaska was considering partnering with the two_men to buy the Drake Hotel in Manhattan By 2014 Deripaska had filed a petition in a Cayman Islands court accusing Manafort and Gates of taking $19 million intended for investment then failing to account for the funds or return themDeripaska nowabout $65 billion according to Forbes has always stayed close to power He married the daughter of Yeltsins chief of staff part of the family the coterie of influential advisers around Yeltsin Under Putin he survived near-bankruptcy to later invest more_than $1 billionin Putins pet project the 2014 Sochi Olympics A Russian state bank helped Deripaska with billions in loans Russias foreign_minister has lobbied to help him get a US visa and a 2006 US diplomatic cable disclosed by WikiLeakssaid he wasamong the 2-3 oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis and a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putins trips abroadAfter graduating from Moscow State University with a degree in nuclear physics Deripaska began his career as a metals trader in the mid-1990s before buying a stake in a Siberian aluminum smelter which eventually grew into the Sibirsky Aluminium Group The group now called Basic Element owns a 47 percent stake in Rusal one of the largest aluminum-producing companies in the world along with the hydroelectric power producer EuroSibEnergo the GAZ automotive group infrastructure construction companies and the Russian insurance company IngosstrakhThe metals business in 1990s Russia The two settled out of court in 2012 Deripaska alleged that Cherney was in league with another manAnton Malevsky who died mysteriouslyin a parachuting accident in South AfricaThe business also made Deripaska fantasticallywealthy In 2008 Forbes listed him as the richest man in Russia and the ninth-richest man in the world with a net worth of $28 billion By this timeDeripaska was meeting with a string of high-profile Western politicians Deripaska helped sparka scandal in British politics in 2008 when it was revealed that he had hosted the Conservative Partys chief spokesman on finance George Osborne on his $150 million yacht in the Mediterraneanthat Deripaskas connections to Putin or at_least the Russian_government have been sufficiently closethat as recently as 2016 Russian Foreign_Minister Sergey Lavrov had lobbied on behalf of Deripaska for the United_States to admit himDeripaskas business was blindsided by the financial_crisis and collapse in commodity prices of 2008 and he was forced to refinance loans according to with support from the Kremlin In a $50 billion bailout thestate-run Vnesheconombank or VEB gave Deripaska one of the largest loans $45 billion to pay off foreign banks and avoid surrendering stakes in companies he had put up as collateral When a Financial Times reporter asked him in 2010 how close he had come to going out of business he replied Very closeThat also brought political trouble In 2009 workers in the town of Pikalevo (population 22000) began protesting after Deripaskas alumina refinery there halted production triggering layoffs and pay cutsThe protests attracted the attention of Putin who flew out personally to show that he was engaged in solving an economic crisis that was repeating itself across the country In a dressing-down of the factory owners later broadcastnationwidePutin berated Deripaska and forced him to sign a contract restarting the plant As Deripaska walked away Putin saidAnd give me back my penYet Deripaska rebounded surviving the financial_crisis in large part thanks to generous government loans By 2014 he was investing more_than $1 billion in the Sochi Olympics includingbuilding theOlympic Village a 26-mile road around the Olympic venues and an expansion of the citys airport According to Russias Vedomosti newspaper Deripaska

Monday headlining a get-out-the-vote rally in Sterling a DC exurban town in swing Loudoun County The event is free and open to the public It will come days after New Mexico Gov Susana Martinez (R) the nations first elected Latina governor is scheduled Thursday to appear with Gillespie at business roundtables and a luncheon in northern VirginiaSenator Rubio and Governor Martinez are strong conservative leaders and I am thrilled to welcome each of them back to the Commonwealth in the closing weeks of this critically important election Gillespie said through a spokesman Their appearances

in order to win statewide Gillespie faces Democrat Ralph_Northam on Nov 7 On Tuesday Latino groups announced they would air Spanish language radio ads in Virginia urging voters to support the Democratic ticket It is important for the Latino community to understand the major differences between the candidates said Julio Lainez state director for Americas Voice Virginia The hateful campaign being run by Gillespie and the Virginia Republican_Party aims to divide VirginiansRubio carried northern Virginia counties in the 2016 Republican presidential primary though he narrowly lost the state to Donald Trump He has continued to be critical of the president a divide that Democrats played up Gotta sting that Ed would rather campaign with Lil Marco than you @realDonaldTrump tweeted Northam

overwhelmingly for Trump in November Northam meanwhile had former president and former vice_president campaign with him in the last_week US Sen Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nevada) the nations first Latina senator met with a small_group of Latino students at George Mason University on Monday to plug Northams candidacySergey Kislyak Russias long-serving ambassador to the United_States has a habit noticed by many US officials who have known the envoyKislyak shows up everywhere and tries to talk to everyoneHe doesnt get as much credit as he should in my view for being savvy about developing relationships with people all over the city said Michael McFaul who knew the diplomat well while_serving in the Obama_administration as senior adviser on Russia and then as US ambassador to RussiaMoscows man in Washington is an unlikely man of the political moment however He is quiet careful rumpled and portly He is a fierce defender of Russias international prestige who rarely gives interviews and even more rarely makes news on his own He is not considered especially close to Russian President_Vladimir PutinFor Kislyak to have sought contacts with former national_security adviser_Michael Flynn and Attorney_General Jeff_Sessions in 2016 when the latter was a US senator should come as no surprise current and former US officials said Flynn a retired Army lieutenant general and former head of the Defense Intelligence_Agency was a top national_security adviser and frequent warm-up act for Trump during the campaign He was forced out as national_security adviser at the White_House over concerns he had misled Vice_President Pence and others about his contacts with Kislyak before Trump took officeSessions then a US senator from Alabama was among Trumps early supporters in Congress and went on television to promote the candidate He has for two meetings with Kislyak last yearThe Russian diplomat who speaks excellent English seems to know American officials past and present across the political and ideological spectrum Several Americans who know him say he prides himself on proximity he always seems to have just had dinner with someone influential or just happens to be seated up front at newsworthy foreign_policy eventsJohn McLaughlin a former deputy CIA_director and acting CIA_director under Obama said that it does strain credibility that Sessions would have simply forgotten about his meetings with Kislyak when he asserted during his confirmation_hearing to become attorney_general that he had not met with Russian officialsI know Ambassador Kislyak Hes a veteran of Russian diplomacy and hes a hard guy to forget if youve met with him McLaughlin said during an_interview Thursday with MSNBC host Andrea MitchellSessions said that he was taken aback by a question which referred to a breaking news story about contacts_between Trump campaign surrogates and Russians In retrospect I should have slowed down and said I did meet one Russian official a couple times That would be the ambassador he saidKislyak arrived as ambassador in 2008 a few months before the start of the Obama_administration and is expected to leave this spring His replacement has not been announcedThe Russian Embassy did_not respond to a request for an_interview with KislyakMost of the ambassadors outreach efforts focus on the executive_branch as is the custom for Russian diplomats whose political system back home is top-downLawmakers are often reluctant to meet with senior Russian officials independently because diplomacy and intelligence gathering tend to blur for Moscows representatives in the United StatesStill the Sessions contacts on their own are of a piece with what foreign ambassadors and especially Kislyak see as a part of their job current and former US officials and Russia experts saidIt seems entirely routine for the ambassador of a foreign government to want to meet with senators for example and especially one who is a member of the Armed_Services Committee said Paul Saunders a Russia specialist at the Center for the National Interest and a former official in the George_W Bush administrationMost members of the Armed_Services Committee however told The_Post that they had not met with Kislyak last yearSaunderss group hosted then-candidate Donald Trump for a foreign_policy speech in April last yearKislyak was in the audience as one of four invited foreign ambassadors as Trump proclaimed America-first will be the major and overriding theme of my administrationKislyak is known to collect scores of business cards as he moves around Washington and to follow up sometimes relentlessly with requests for one-on-one meetings Sessions said Thursday that Kislyak had also invited him to lunch an invitation he never took upHe was constantly doing that when I was in the government McFaul said of Kislyaks ability to speak to US officials at the Pentagon and elsewhere sometimes without the White_House knowing about it first At times it would be frustrating to usKislyak a physicist and arms-control expert by training has succeeded as a diplomat by voicing the official Russian line on all issues in genial terms and within the hierarchy of Russian diplomacy by always having fresh news gossip and political analysis to feed back homeIt is not clear how_much Kislyak knew about what US intelligence officials have said was a concerted Russian_government effort to influence the US presidential_election although it is likely that he was at_least aware of it said Steven Hall former head of Russia operations at the CIAIn the case of Sessions who was considered a top prospect for a Cabinet job when Kislyak visited him in his Senate office in September Kislyak would have wanted to know How reasonable is he from a Russia perspective Hall saidKislyak denied that Russia was meddling in the election during an address to the Detroit Economic Club less_than two_weeks before the Nov8 electionWe have become kind of collateral damage in the fight between the two parties he said adding that Russia is ready to work with any president that is going to be electedOpinions differ on whether Kislyak is a spy in the American sense of the wordFor them its much grayer Hall said of the Russian view of the difference_between a diplomat and spy I would say [Kislyak] is most definitely both In the Russian system its simply assumed that theyre all collecting and doing whatever they can either covertly or overtly Greg Miller and Julie_Tate contributed to this_reportThe director of national intelligence on Wednesday said officials had seen signs of attempted cyberattacks on 2016_presidential campaignsWeve already had some indications of that James_R Clapper_Jr said at a cyber-event at the Bipartisan Policy Center in WashingtonHe did_not indicate whether the attempted intrusions were successful or whether they were by foreign or domestic hackers Nor did he specify whether the websites or campaign networks of Democratic candidates Hillary_Clinton and Bernie_Sanders or Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump were targetedWere aware that campaigns and related organizations and individuals are targeted by actors with a variety of motivations from philosophical differences to espionage and capabilities from defacements to intrusions said Brian P Hale director of public affairs for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence We defer to FBI for specific incidentsIn 2008 Chinese hackers compromised the computer networks of Sens Barack_Obama (D-Ill) and John_McCain (R-Ariz) In 2012 foreign and domestic hackers tried to gain access to the campaign networks of Obama and Mitt Romney (R)The US government and American businesses have become constant targets for hackers In 2013 federal agents more_than 3000 US companies that their computer systems had been hacked in the previous year The Pentagon reportedly sees millions of attempts a day

aluminum-sided building that held a spectacle 65million years in the making Then they stepped inside and finally saw it the Nations T_rex standing upright for the first time since the Cretaceous PeriodOne of them gasped Arms crossed another quietly circled the 12-foot-tall 35-foot-long skeleton A third the one who almost always has something to say could say nothing at allA rare moment dinosaur curator Matthew Carrano recalled that afternoon when Im not talkingIn what may be among the most dramatic fossil displays on earth the beast was posed looming over the fiberglass body of a triceratops collapsed on its side With one foot crushing into the horned herbivores ribs the s head which is the size of a riding lawn mower was bent down appearing as if a moment away from decapitating its preyDiscovered in Montana in 1988 the dinosaur had been exhibited in pieces until last_year when the Smithsonian Institution took possession of the coveted fossil on a 50-year loan from its owner the Army Corps of Engineers Last fall the animals bones were shipped to Ontarios Research Casting International a renowned firm of experts that has assembled dinosaurs for museums all over the worldThe Smithsonian team had imagined the ambitious presentation two years_ago first through Carranos hand gestures then in pencil on sheets of paper then on computer screens then in a miniature 3-D model But none of that would matter if the real-life display didnt workFor one of the worlds most-visited museums the stakes couldnt be much higher The dinosaur has been given the grandiose title of the Nations T_rex after all and it will serve as the gem of the Natural History Museums fossil hall when the after a $48million renovationOne day the team knew this T_rex may become the most viewed in historyThe blowtorch hissed as its blue flame licked a blackened section of the T rexs steel tailWith his colleague applying the heat Garth Dallman stood on a nearby ladder and stared through clear safety glasses at the glowing metal On the back of his tan T-shirt was the cartoon image of a blowtorch-wielding human skeleton riding the back of a T_rex skeletonDallman and others from the casting company had worked through the weekend adding to the more_than 4000 man hours they had spent on this project in preparation for Mondays big unveiling They had attached the T rexs rib-stomping foot just moments before the Smithsonian team arrived and by afternoon Dallman looked very much like a man who needed a nap His black-circled eyes were bloodshot and behind his ear was a pencil with an eraser rubbed down to the metal casingBut rest would have to wait because on Tuesday they were raising the tail five inches The museum wanted to be sure that its lowest point hung

angle grinder and a drill a new bolt was soon installed and Dallman was on to the next challenge The dinosaur is one of the most complete T_rex skeletons ever unearthed with more_than 130original

then used duct tape to attach his tracing of what looked like a crocodile skeletonIts very low tech said Jabo a Smithsonian fossil preparator He and his colleagues had come to Canada not just to gawk at their prized monster but also to determine precisely how the T_rex and everything around it should appearJabo brought the champsosaurus model and two other small cutouts to museum project manager Siobhan Starrs and Pauline Dolovich a Toronto-based designer who is helping to plan the layoutWheres champsy going to go Jabo saidStarrs and Dolovich needed a minute The pair had spent much of the prior 36 hours consulting a book of designs thicker than a dictionaryThis is two volumes Dolovich said later of nineMost buildings are designed by the foot but not the fossil hall Its being designed by the which means that 45million presentation decisions have to be made and thats counting only the floor spaceIn the District three weeks earlier museum director Kirk Johnson stood in the empty hall and detailed its future his voice echoing through an expanse that felt far more like a tomb than it ever had when it was filled with dead animals Lights flickered yellow caution tape hung from columns and sections of walls were gashed as if an actual T_rex had chomped into themLike clearing plaque from an artery the museums staffers will dismantle decades of incremental additions and clutter Many of the 2400 now-removed specimens also wont be brought back as the space once dubbed the Hall of Extinct Monsters returns to its 1910 design a much more open layout that will be partly lit by sunshine Though the museums attendance is only slightly behind last years pace of 73million visitors Johnson had once hoped that the renovation wouldnt require five_years He now knows that it will take every bit of it and in Canada the museums team seemed acutely aware of the time crunchThey settled on a spot for the champsosaurus and its companions They discussed how to depict the triceratops cast deciding that its frill could have puncture wounds but no claw marks because Carrano had never seen such a wound on an actual fossil They debated how high they should place the tail of what will be the T rexs neighbor an edmontosaurus that the cast companys technicians had found was covered in part by a 1903 copy of The Washington_Post (BUY A HOME In Washingtons Most Popular Residence Section

as the afternoon waned and the museum teams flight back to DC approached Starrs sat cross-legged on the floor jotting down notes with her back to the Smithsonians most_important dinosaurShe paused and looked upIt gives_me goose bumps literally to think about how many children and their children and grandchildren will remember the moment she said pointing over her shoulder And the moment is in front

allegedly showing that a former campaign_chairman for President Trump laundered payments from the party of a disgraced ex-leader of Ukraine using offshore_accounts in Belize and Kyrgyzstan The new documents if legitimate stem from business ties_between the Trump aide Paul_Manafort and the party of former Ukrainian president Viktor_Yanukovych who enjoyed Moscows backing while he was in power He has been in hiding in Russia since being overthrown by pro-Western protesters in 2014 and is wanted in Ukraine on corruption chargesThe latest documents were released just hours after the House_Intelligence Committee questioned FBI_Director James_B Comey about possible_coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow The hearing that also touched on Manaforts work for Yanukovychs party in UkraineComey declined to say whether the FBI is coordinating with Ukraine on an investigation of the alleged payments to Manafort Manafort who worked for Yanukovychs Party of Regions for nearly a decade resigned from Trumps campaign in August after his name surfaced in connection with secret payments totaling $127million by Yanukovychs party Manafort has denied receiving those listed in the partys black ledger Serhiy Leshchenko a lawmaker and journalist released a copy of an invoice on letterhead from Manaforts consulting company based in Alexandria_Va dated Oct 14 2009 to a Belize-based company for $750000 for the sale of 501 computersOn the same_day Manaforts name is listed next to a $750000 entry in the black ledger which was considered a party slush fund The list was found at the party headquarters in the turmoil after Ukraines 2014 revolution The ledger entries about Manafort were released by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine a government law_enforcement agency last AugustLeshchenko alleges that Manafort falsified an invoice to the Belize company to legitimize the $750000 payment to himselfI have found during this investigation that [Manafort] used offshore jurisdictions and falsified invoices to get money from the corrupt Ukrainian leader Leshchenko said during a news_conference in downtown Kiev where he provided a copy of the invoice to journalists He said he received the invoices and other documents in January from the new tenants of Manaforts former offices in downtown Kiev The documents were left behind in a safe he said adding that Manaforts signature and his company seal were proof that the documents were authenticLeshchenko said he was not aware of any formal Ukrainian investigation of the documents He declined to comment on whether he had discussed the documents with US law_enforcement agenciesNazar Kholodnytskyi a deputy prosecutor general of Ukraine whose department specializes in corruption cases said in an_interview on Tuesday that the documents hadnt been confirmed by law_enforcement or to his knowledge submitted for examination There is an ongoing investigation_into the black ledgers he said but Manafort was not a target of that investigation Manafort has previously accused Leshchenko of blackmailing him by threatening to release harmful information about his financial relationshipwith Yanukovych That correspondence between Leshchenko and Manaforts daughter was released in February as the result of a purported cyberhack Leshchenko has called the exchange a forgeryManafort was involved in crafting the political strategy that brought Yanukovych to power after a crushing defeat in the 2004 elections Yanukovychs party has been accused of ties to Russian President_Vladimir Putin particularly through wealthy oligarchs from the countrys east with interests in both Russia and UkraineVirginia Democrat Ralph_Northam is airing a new statewide commercial in the final days of the governors race in which he calls negative ads from his Republican opponent despicable After weeks of advertising from Republican Ed_Gillespie that sought to tie Northam first to MS-13_gang violence and then to a child pornographer Northams new commercial blasts them as false attacks Since September Gillespie has been airing a controversial commercial that appears to have been viewed by both President Trump and former president_Barack Obama that suggests Northam is responsible for an increased the threat of Media fact-checkers have found those claims falseNorthams new ad slams it as while highlighting his background as an Army doctor and pediatrician and touts he helped pass tougher penalties for gang_members and violent sexual predators as a state senatorIm a pediatrician and for Ed_Gillespie to say I would tolerate anyone hurting a child is despicable Northam says to the camera Thats a reference to Gillespies criticizing Northam for supporting Democratic Gov Terry McAuliffes restoration of voting_rights to felons who completed their sentences including a suspected child pornographer In campaign ads airing this week Gillespie highlights the case of John Bowen who was convicted in 2001 of aggravated sexual battery and indecent liberties with a minor His voting_rights were briefly restored two months after he was arrested but not convicted on suspicion of having a large trove of child pornography He lost his voting_rights again in January when he pleaded_guilty to the pornography charges McAuliffe who cannot seek consecutive terms defended the restoration of felon rights saying its the same system that exists in 40 other states Gillespies ads also say the restoration of voting_rights made it easier for felons to get a gun Felons still needed a judges approval to legally obtain firearms Dave Abrams a spokesman for Gillespie said Northams response ad does_not dispute any specific facts He apparently cannot refute any of it said Abrams And these issues matter The war over the airwaves comes as Election_Day looms on Nov 7 The race has taken a nasty turn and Democrats have sent out a mailer that who marched over the summer in Charlottesville Quentin Kidd a pollster and political_scientist at Christopher Newport University said he sees Northam heeding the lessons of not letting attacks go unansweredIts largely akin to trench warfare Kidd said The Northam campaigns full-throated response is essentially a full-throated defense of the small lead that they haveMost public polls show Gillespie and Northam tied or Northam with a slight leadWhile Northams ad hits Gillespie for dubious facts in his ads about gang_violence it also contained a factual error The commercials says he helped pass legislation strengthening gang penalties but the bill cited on the screen did_not passA spokesman for Northam said the ad will be corrected to reflect different legislation that Northam supported and became lawThe cries began shortly_before 5 am echoing down the almost empty corridors of United Medical Centers nursing_home From his bed in Room 704 Warren Webbs moans cohered into words Help I cant breathe

bed and landed on the floor his diaper coming looseWebb a 47-year-old AIDS patient would lie on the floor in his own waste for approximately 20 minutes while his nurse quarreled with his roommate and then conversed with a security guard When he was finally lifted back into bed his caregivers could not find a pulse Just after 6am he was pronounced deadWebbs death on Aug 25 reconstructed through a time-stamped audio recording of the incident obtained by The Washington_Post and interviews with three eyewitnesses is the latest in a string of troubling incidents at the Districts only public hospital UMC staff members do not appear to have followed what medical experts described as basic and potentially lifesaving protocols in their treatment of Webb immediately before his death In the aftermath hospital officials fired one of the nurses involved but failed to report details of Webbs case to regulators that would have triggered an outside investigation Webbs relatives say hospital staff members misled them about the events that preceded his deathA spokeswoman for the DC Health Department said that the nursing_home had filed an incident report concerning Webb who according to his death certificate died after a heart_attack but that the report did_not contain any information that pointed towards injury neglect or abuseAfter learning new details about Webbs_death from The_Post the Health Department is launching an investigation spokeswoman Jasmine Gossett saidThe Joint Commission an accreditation body that visited UMC in September was not aware of any patient-safety concerns related to Webbs_death a spokeswoman said She said the commission would now review the incidentHospital officials declined to answer detailed questions about Webbs case but issued a statement asserting that the incident was handled properlyThe matter was investigated and based on the findings appropriate actions were taken the statement reads Timely notification to the appropriate regulatory and licensing bodies was provided and they are conducting their respective investigations Due to resident/patient and employee privacy regulations as well as the other ongoing investigations we are not at liberty to discuss the matter further However we continue to cooperate fullyQuestions about Webbs_death come as DC elected officials are intensifying their oversight of UMC which is struggling with deteriorating finances and growing concerns about patient safety Since last_year the city has been paying a politically connected consulting_firm Veritas of Washington $300000 a month to run the hospitalVincent Gray a Ward 7 Democrat and chairman of the DC Councils health committee plans to hold a hearing Monday on whether UMC needs new management The citys largest medical facility east of the Anacostia River UMC has for decades drifted in and out of financial turmoil while_serving its poor and predominantly African American patients in Southeast Washington and Prince_Georges County MdOn Aug 7 regulators closed the hospitals nursery and delivery rooms after discovering dangerous medical errors in the treatment of pregnant women and newborns The_Post reported last_month that the consultants managing UMC had delivered about a tenth of the $9 million in extra revenue they had promised to generate even while collecting $5 million in taxpayer dollars Webbs treatment and the handling of his death could revive allegations that have dogged hospital officials in recent months that UMC staff is sometimes dismissive of or disrespectful toward patients and that hospital supervisors are slow to acknowledge and correct mistakesWebbs father Baye Webb a 71-year-old resident of Lanham Md said nurses did_not disclose key details when they explained his sons death such as his repeated cries for help or the extended period when he was left on the floor of his roomWe totally felt like they were misleading us and the facts werent forthcoming he said Of the new information about his sons death he said simply Its agonizingWarren Webb was born in the District and although he spent some of his teenage years in South Carolina and as an adult lived in Georgia always considered Washington his home A cinephile who organized movie nights at his apartment complex in Southeast Washington he jokingly called his mother Mommie Dearest a reference to the 1981 film that depicts actress Joan Crawfords tortured relationship with her daughterThat sense of humor helped him weather difficult stretches in his life including his HIV infection his diagnosis with a form of bipolar disorder and a period when he used crack cocaine said his mother Tujuana Bigelow a resident of Glenarden Md In late July he was admitted to UMCs skilled nursing facility for rehabilitation after being diagnosed with a brain mass that caused strokelike symptomsBigelow a 66-year-old Prince_Georges County school bus driver said she visited her son almost every day She quickly became alarmed by what she saw as his nurses inattentiveness When her son was admitted she said he could still walk to the bathroom At UMC they immediately put him in diapers She said his nurses were slow to respond to the call button in his room and would sometimes leave him in a soiled diaper for hours on endNobody helped Nobody cared It was so sad Bigelow said After being notified of their sons death on the morning of Aug 25 Webbs parents met with his caregivers at the UMC nursing_home Bigelow said they gave a halting explanation of what had happened A nurse recounted that she slid him to the floor to clean him up after he had a bowel movement and then sent him to the emergency_room when she noticed that he wasnt breathingWhat they were saying didnt make any sense to me Bigelow said Why would you take a patient out of the bed and put him on the floor to change himBigelow said she suspected hospital officials were withholding information You could see it the way they were stumbling every time I asked a question she said Several hours earlier Webbs 58-year-old roommate Gregory Gary rolled up in his wheelchair to the nursing station on the hospitals seventh floorAt the nursing station Gary asked Peter Offor a licensed practical nurse if he could send someone to change Webbs diaper In an Aug 31 written statement describing the incident to hospital officials Offor said he sent Webbs charge nurse to the patients room In an_interview Offor identified the charge nurse as Christiana Ekwue Gary said in an_interview that when he returned to the room the charge nurse was there and Webb who had become contorted on his bed was complaining that he couldnt breathe and calling for help to sit upGary said the nurse pushed a button that dropped Webbs mechanical hospital bed to its lowest setting Webb then rolled off the bed onto the floor with all the mess and stuff all over Gary said She didnt give him any assistance to try to better the situation She didnt make no attempt to help him sit up to where it would allow him to breathe betterEkwue repeatedly declined to discuss Webbs_death when reached by telephone but confirmed that she is still employed at UMCIn the recording obtained by The_Post Webb can be heard crying out at_least 25 times during a three-minute period that begins just before the nurse enters his room Many of his cries are inchoate but he clearly gasps out his complaintI cant breathe Webb says Help me up PleaseIn the recording Gary also urges the nurse to help Webb He cant hardly breathe Gary says His pleading grows more urgent as Webb rolls out of his bed You aint helping him Gary says You aint doing s--- Mind your business Ekwue says on the tapeMary Uwemedimo a certified nursing assistant entered Webbs room shortly_after Ekwue She said in an_interview that when she arrived Webb was lying on the floor and that she placed some linens around him to soak up the urine and feces from his loosened diaperI was shocked to see him lying on the floor said Uwemedimo who later resigned for reasons she said were unrelated to Webbs case She said the charge nurse told her she had lowered the bed so Webb wouldnt hurt himself if he fell off A security guard arrived it is unclear_whether he was making routine rounds or responding to a call about the argument and spoke to Gary about his alleged hostility toward the nurse He then spent several minutes at the nursing station talking with Ekwue and OfforAbout 510 am Ekwue can be heard asking for help at the nursing station to lift Webb off the floor Offor said in an_interview that when he entered the room Webb did_not appear to be in distress but that after they lifted him back into bed they could not find his pulseAbout 523 am Offor can be heard in the recording calling for a crash cart a mobile stand that carries emergency lifesaving equipment Offor and Uwemedimo said a night supervisor was called In the recording the supervisor who is not identified can be heard entering the room about 526 am asking what_happened and demanding a stretcher so Webb could be moved to the hospitals emergency_room A delay ensues however as Uwemedimo returns almost two minutes later and says she cannot find a stretcher Get one downstairs the supervisor orders in the recordingUwemedimo told The_Post that the stretcher usually kept on the seventh floor of the hospital was not in its normal place and that she believed nurses from another floor had taken it She said she went downstairs got a stretcher and returned with it to Webbs roomWebb was pronounced dead in the emergency_room at 601 am His cause of death a heart attackDeath certificates for low-income nursing_home residents are notoriously imprecise said Jonathan Evans a Charlottesville specialist in geriatric medicine and past president of the American Medical Directors AssociationBut if the principal listed cause of death for Webb myocardial infarction commonly called a heart_attack is correct leaving him on the floor for an extended period could have affected his chances of survival Evans saidIf he had a heart_attack that time delay could have had a significant impact on whether he lived or not he saidTammy Slater an acute-care nurse practitioner and instructor at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing said a complaint of shortness of breath from a nursing-home patient should trigger an immediate physical assessment including measurements of heart rate respiration rate blood pressure and blood-oxygen saturationA quick fast assessment Im talking minutes should occur because this patient could be having a life-altering scenario Slater said Trouble breathing could be a sign of two potentially deadly conditions that require immediate treatment Slater said a heart_attack or pulmonary embolism In both situations she said minutes countSlater said a patient rolling out of bed onto the floor even if only a short distance should also have been treated as a fall and triggered a prompt assessment for injuriesIt remains unclear what steps hospital officials took to investigate after Webbs_death Uwemedimo said her supervisor asked her to provide a written statement about what_happened on the morning Webb died but that nobody has interviewed herOffor was fired after Webbs_death In a September letter explaining Offors termination that was obtained by The_Post nursing_home administrator Stephen Gbenle wrote that Warren Webb was yelling for help saying I cant breathe and that Offor did_not get up from his seat to assist the resident UMC Chief Nursing Officer Maribel Torres also filed a complaint against Offor with the Districts nursing board It is unclear why Offor who was the first person to realize the seriousness of his condition and attempt to save his life was targeted for punishment Offor said that hospital officials refused to carry out the corporate investigation of Webbs_death that should have been performed and that nobody interviewed him about what_happened before he was approached by The PostGary left UMC in October to move into an apartment in Southeast Washington He said that Gbenle approached him about a week after Webbs_death to discuss the incident but that he wasnt feeling well and asked him to come back later No one ever followed up he saidYou have some people who come here thats compassionate about their job Gary said of the UMC nursing_home And you have a lot of them come here thats not Julie_Tate and Daniel Mich contributed to this_reportThe CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency rather_than just to according to officials briefed on the matterIntelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian_government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of from the Democratic_National Committee and others including Hillary_Clintons campaign_chairman according to US officials Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence_community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clintons chances It is the assessment of the intelligence_community that Russias goal here was to favor one candidate over the other to help Trump get elected said a senior US official briefed on an intelligence presentation made to US senators Thats the consensus view The Obama_administration has been debating for months how to respond to the alleged Russian intrusions with White_House officials concerned about escalating tensions with Moscow and being accused of trying to boost Clintons campaignIn September during a secret briefing for congressional leaders Senate Majority_Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) voiced doubts about the veracity of the intelligence according to officials presentThe Trump transition_team dismissed the findings in a short statement issued Friday evening These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history Its now time to move on and Make America Great Again the statement read Trump has consistently dismissed the intelligence communitys findings about Russian hackingI dont believe they interfered in the election he told Time magazine this week The hacking he said could be Russia And it could be China And it could be some guy in his home in New_Jersey The CIA shared its latest assessment with key senators in a closed-door briefing on Capitol_Hill last_week in which agency officials cited a growing body of intelligence from multiple sources Agency briefers told the senators it was now quite clear that electing Trump was Russias goal according to the officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence mattersThe CIA presentation to senators about Russias intentions fell short of a formal US assessment produced by all 17 intelligence_agencies A senior US official said there were minor disagreements among intelligence officials about the agencys assessment in part because some questions remain unansweredFor example intelligence_agencies do not have specific intelligence showing officials in the Kremlin directing the identified individuals to pass the Democratic emails to WikiLeaks a second senior US official said Those actors according to the official were one step removed from the Russian_government rather_than government employees Moscow has in the past used middlemen to participate in sensitive intelligence operations so it has plausible deniabilityJulian Assange the founder of WikiLeaks has said that the Russian_government is not the sourceThe White_House and CIA officials declined to commentOn Friday the White_House said President Obama had ordered a full review of Russian hacking during the election campaign as pressure from Congress has grown for greater public understanding of exactly what Moscow did to influence the electoral processWe may have crossed into a new threshold and it is incumbent upon us to take stock of that to review to conduct some after-action to understand what has happened and to impart some lessons learned Obamas counterterrorism and homeland_security adviser Lisa Monaco told_reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science MonitorObama wants the report before he leaves office Jan20 Monaco said The review will be led by James Clapper the outgoing director of national intelligence officials saidDuring her remarks Monaco didnt address the latest CIA assessment which hasnt been previously disclosed last_week asked Obama to declassify details about the intrusions and why officials believe that the Kremlin was behind the operation Officials said Friday that the senators specifically were asking the White_House to release portions of the CIAs presentationThis week top Democratic lawmakers in the House also to Obama asking for briefings on Russian_interference in the electionUS intelligence_agencies have been cautious for months in characterizing Russias motivations reflecting the United_States long-standing struggle to collect reliable intelligence on President_Vladimir Putin and those closest to himIn previous assessments the CIA and other intelligence_agencies told the White_House and congressional leaders that they believed Moscows aim was to undermine confidence in the US electoral system The assessments stopped short of saying the goal was to help elect TrumpOn Oct7 the of seeking to interfere in the election through the hacking of political organizations Though the statement never specified which party it was clear that officials were referring to cyber-intrusions into the and other Democratic groups and individualsSome key Republican lawmakers have continued to question the quality of evidence supporting Russian involvementIll be the first one to come out and point at Russia if theres clear evidence but there is no clear evidence even now said Rep_Devin Nunes_(R-Calif) the chairman of the House_Intelligence Committee and a member of the Trump transition_team Theres a lot of innuendo lots of circumstantial evidence thats it Though Russia has long conducted cyberspying on US agencies companies and organizations this presidential campaign marks the first time Moscow has attempted through cyber-means to interfere in if not actively influence the outcome of an election the officials saidThe reluctance of the Obama White_House to respond to the alleged Russian intrusions before Election_Day upset Democrats on the Hill as well as members of the Clinton campaignWithin the administration top officials from different agencies sparred over whether and how to respond White_House officials were concerned that covert retaliatory measures might risk an escalation in which Russia with sophisticated cyber-capabilities might have less to lose than the United_States with its vast and vulnerable digital infrastructureThe White_Houses reluctance to take that risk left Washington weighing more-limited measures including the naming and shaming approach of publicly blaming MoscowBy mid-September White_House officials had decided it was time to take that step but they worried that doing so unilaterally and without bipartisan congressional backing just weeks before the election would make Obama vulnerable to charges that he was using intelligence for political purposesInstead officials devised a plan to seek bipartisan support from top lawmakers and set_up a secret meeting with the Gang of 12 a group that includes House and Senate leaders as well as the chairmen and ranking members of both chambers committees on intelligence and homeland securityObama dispatched Monaco FBI_Director James_B Comey and Homeland_Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to make the pitch for a show of solidarity and bipartisan unity against Russian_interference in the election according to a senior administration officialSpecifically the White_House wanted congressional leaders to sign off on a bipartisan statement urging state and local officials to take federal help in protecting their voting-registration and balloting machines from Russian cyber-intrusionsThough US intelligence_agencies were skeptical that hackers would be able to manipulate the election results in a systematic way the White_House feared that Russia would attempt to do so sowing doubt about the fundamental mechanisms of democracy and potentially forcing a more dangerous confrontation between Washington and Moscow In a secure room in the Capitol used for briefings involving classified_information administration officials broadly laid out the evidence US spy_agencies had collected showing Russias role in cyber-intrusions in at_least two states and in hacking the emails of the Democratic organizations and individualsAnd they made a case for a united bipartisan front in response to what one official described as the threat posed by unprecedented meddling by a foreign power in our election processThe Democratic leaders in the room unanimously agreed on the need to take the threat seriously Republicans however were divided with at_least two GOP lawmakers reluctant to accede to the White_House requestsAccording to several officials McConnell raised doubts about the underlying intelligence and made clear to the administration that he would consider any effort by the White_House to challenge the Russians publicly an act of partisan politicsSome of the Republicans in the briefing also seemed opposed to the idea of going public with such explosive allegations in the final stages of an election a move that they argued would only rattle public confidence and play into Moscows handsMcConnells office did_not respond to a request for comment After the election Trump chose McConnells wife Elaine Chao as his nominee for transportation secretarySome Clinton supporters saw the White_Houses reluctance to act without bipartisan support as further evidence of an excessive caution in facing adversariesThe lack of an administration response on the Russian hacking cannot be attributed to Congress said Rep Adam_B Schiff_(Calif) the ranking_Democrat on the House_Intelligence Committee who was at the September meeting The administration has all the tools it needs to respond They have the ability to impose sanctions They have the ability to take clandestine means The administration has decided not to utilize them in a way that would deter the Russians and I_think thats a problem Philip_Rucker contributed to this reportPresident Trump to removing Confederate statues from public places saying it was sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monumentsThat appeal to history and culture echoes arguments made by neo-Confederate groups whocouch claimsabout the meaning of statues and other Confederate symbols in terms of heritage and other supposedly fundamental values that modern Americans are seen to have abandonedMost mainstream historians note on the other hand that Most of them were erected between 1895 and World_War I part of a campaign to paint the Southern cause in the Civil_War as just and slavery as a benevolent institution Most monuments were created during the Jim Crow era to stand in opposition to racial equality formerly the Atlanta Historical Society Veneration of Confederates symbolized white racial dominanceBut the president is not a historian and neither are most members of the American public A found that by more_than 2to1 Americans believe that Confederate_monuments are symbols of Southern pride rather_than of white supremacyWhites (66 percent) Republicans (84 percent) and Americans over age 65 (71 percent) are especially likely to say that Confederate_monuments represent pride rather_than supremacy Liberals (54 percent) Hillary_Clinton voters (52 percent) and black Americans (47 percent) are the groups most_likely to say that the monuments stand for white supremacySimilara plurality of Americans (48 percent) say they disapprove of the decision to remove the statue of Confederate general Robert_E Lee from Charlottesville the decision that sparked the violent rally by neo-Nazis and white_supremacists last weekend Only 30 percent say they approve of the decision In his remarks about the monuments the president may be making a calculatedattempt to motivate the approval of voters like the ones identified in the Economist/YouGov survey who arent sold on the idea that monuments to the Confederacy are monuments to racismThe presidents chief_strategist Stephen_K Bannon in an_interview with the New_York Times this week Just give me more Bannon saidTear down more statues Say the revolution is coming I cant get enough of itBut that calculation could backfire Trump remains a historically unpopular president with Given that unpopularity taking a strong stand in favor of Confederate_monuments could simply motivate public opinion in opposition to themWeve seen Trumps in action many times before on a variety of issues Obamacare transgender_troops the border wall the

SessionsDrew Hammill Pelosis deputy chief of staff said Clintons actions involved personal matters while Sessionss actions involve matters of state Pelosi has a point While the two cases involve statements made under_oath the subject matters are vastly differentClinton gave misleading testimony in a private lawsuit filed by former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones and his perjurious

an issue much more germane to national_security than Clintons sex life But we dont_know yet whether Sessions perjured himselfLets review the two cases found 11 possible grounds for Clintons impeachment all having to do with Clintons false_statements under_oath about his sexual activitieswith LewinskyClinton was accused of repeatedly lying under_oath to a grand_jury in his civil deposition and even to his own lawyer investigators found Clinton abused his constitutional authority by lying to the public and Congress throughout 1998 and tried to obstruct justice investigators foundFrom the Starr reportThere is substantial and credible information that the Presidents lies about his relationship with Ms Lewinsky were abundant and calculating according to investigators Lewinsky testified that she and Clinton engaged in sexual relations and there was a DNA sample to support her testimonyIn December 1998 the accusing Clinton of perjury and of obstruction of justice Then in February 1999 the of both charges Five Republicans and all 45 Democrats supported full acquittalAs a senator Sessions voted to convict Clinton on both charges It is crucial to our system of justice that we demand the truth I fear that an acquittal of this President will weaken the legal system by providing an option for those who consider being less_than truthful in courtNow heres what we know about Sessions and his statements to Congress so farSessions was not asked whether he as a campaign surrogate communicated with the Russian_government Franken asked what Sessions would do if the CNN report turned_out to be trueand there was any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian_government Sessions says in general that he is not aware of such communications Then he gives a caveat that he was called to be a surrogate and did_not have communications with RussiaIn a Sen Patrick J Leahy (D-Vt) asked Sessions Several of the President-elects nominees or senior advisers have Russian ties Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian_government about the 2016 election either before or after election daySessions responded NoThe Post found however that Sessions met with Russian_Ambassador Sergey_Kislyak on at_least two occasions Once was after an event on the sidelines of the Republican_National Convention in July 2016 and the other was a private meetingwith KislyakAfter the event at RNC a small_group of ambassadors (including Kislyak) approached Sessions The_Post reported Sessions then spoke individually to some of the ambassadors including Kislyak the official said In the informal exchanges the ambassadors expressed appreciation for his remarks and some of them invited him to events they were sponsoring said the official citing a former Sessions staffer who was at the eventSessionss spokeswoman told The_Post that Sessions did_not consider his conversations relevant to the senators questions He was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed_Services CommitteeHis spokeswoman also characterized Sessionss September conversation with Kislyak as one of more_than 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed_Services Committee Officials also said Sessions did_not remember in detail what he discussed with Kislyak in the private meetingSo did Sessions intentionally mislead senators by saying he as a campaign surrogate did_not communicate with Russia Or was he simply saying he was unaware of evidence to support CNNs report Why didnt Sessions disclose to Franken or Leahy that he had spoken twice to the Russian_ambassador during the campaign in his capacity as a member of the Armed_Services Committee It remains unclearClinton was acquitted by the Senate after a defense stating that he did_not commit perjury as his statements involved inconsistencies and he couldnt be liable for perjury Sessionss statements to the Senate_Judiciary Committee could not be clearer Hammill saidThe details about Sessionss interactions with Kislyak are still unfolding and his explanations about his misleading answers to Franken and Leahy are murky However in the context of Frankens question about members affiliated with the Trump campaign communicating with the Russian_government it is unclear_whether Sessions was intentionally making a false statementWhile the Sessions and Clinton cases both involve statements made under_oath the circumstances are vastly different (Pelosi may be better off comparing Sessionss case former acting_attorney generalin 1972) If one were to weigh Pelosis claim based on whether Sessions and Clinton lied under_oath its clear Clintons case is not far_less than SessionssBut the content of Clintons lies (his sex life) was far_less important than the content of Sessionss statements (about potential foreign influence in US elections) Pelosis staff indicated that she was making a distinction between the content of their statementsStill its too early to jump to such conclusions and make such an extremestatement Pelosi earns Two Pinocchios()How would you rate this claim (The_check mark_means you think the statement is true not that you agree with the rating)We_need to verify that you are an actual_person This is a non-scientific_user poll_Results are not statistically_valid and cannot be assumed to reflect the views of Washington_Post users as a group or the general populationDefense Secretary_Jim Mattis announced Tuesday that he is freezing the implementation of President Trumps ban on transgender_people serving in the military saying that he will first establish a panel of experts to provide advice and recommendations on how to carry out Trumps directiveThe Pentagon confirmed the move in a statement attributed to Mattis saying that he will first develop a study and implementation plan as directed by the president in a memorandum released Friday Soon-to-be arriving political appointees at the Defense_Department will play an important role in this effort Mattis added The plan will address both the potential for transgender_people looking to serve in the military for the first time and transgender_troops who already are servingOur focus must always be on what is best for the militarys combat effectiveness leading to victory on the battlefield Mattis said To that end I will establish a panel of experts serving within the Departments of Defense and Homeland_Security to provide advice and recommendations on the implementation of the presidents directionMattis added that panel members will bring mature experience most notably in combat and deployed operations and seasoned judgment to this task The panel will assemble and thoroughly analyze all pertinent data quantifiable and non-quantifiableThe Pentagon chief said that afterthe panel makes its recommendations and he consults with the secretary of homeland_security he will provide his advice to Trump In the meantime policy regarding transgender_service members will remain in place Mattis said meaning that those serving can continue to do soOn Friday evening the White_House announced that it was moving forward with Trumps transgender ban as Hurricane Harvey roared toward Texas that he wanted the Pentagon to return to the long-standing policy and practice on military service by transgender individuals that was in place prior to June_2016 until such time as a sufficient basis exists to conclude that allowing them to service will not have negative effectsThe memorandum gave Mattis until Feb 1 to present a plan to Trump on how to implement the transgender ban and what to do with transgender_service members already serving Those marked some of the first details the White_House provided on how to carry out Trumps decision which initially took many Pentagon officials by surprise when the president announced it on Twitter on July 26After consultation with my_Generals and military experts_please be advised that the United_States Government will not accept or allow Transgender_individuals to serve in any capacity in the US Military he said in three successive tweets Our_military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous_medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail Thank youAfter consultation with my_Generals and military experts_please be advised that the United_States Government will not accept or allow Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Transgender_individuals to serve in any capacity in the US Military Our_military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous_medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail Thank_you Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Gen Joseph F Dunford Jr the chairman of the Joint_Chiefs of Staff added the following day that transgender_service members already serving will be treated with dignity and respect as the Pentagon sorts out its new policy but that it would carry out Trumps directive once it received guidance on how to do soMattis left the door open to some transgender_service members continuing to serve during an exchange with reporters at the Pentagon this month The defense secretary asked Aug 14 if current service_members would be ousted pointed to Dunfords directiveThe chairman immediately went out and said immediately Everyone stand fast until we get the direction Mattis said I understand that this is probably more about your suspicion about what could be coming but the fact is we have received no direction that would indicate any harm to anybody right nowThe Obama_administration repealed its ban on transgender_service member serving in July 2016 A Rand_Corp study commissioned by the Pentagon found that there were between 2500 and 7000 transgender_people among the 13 million on active_duty but Mattis has questioned whether the study is accurateIm not willing to sign up for the [Rand Corp] numbers you just used and Im not willing to sign up for the concern any of [the transgender_service members] have considering what the chairman said Mattis said earlier_this month And Im not willing to prejudge what the study will now bring outTrumps ban has prompted lawsuits that challenge its constitutionality and rebukes from Democrats in CongressThere is no place for discrimination in our Armed Forces or indeed anywhere else in American society 143 House Democrats said in a letter Tuesday Enforcing your ban could mean discharging active_duty soldiers sailors Marines and members of the Air_Force who are serving honorably It also would mean barring other patriotic Americans from serving in the futureA top US general said Thursday that the Pentagon has informed Russia of where US Special_Operations forces are operating in Syriatold reporters that the United_States has outlined to the Russians where the US forces are operating in not specific areas but firmly broad areas to ensure the troops safetyPentagon press_secretary Peter Cook would not go into specifics regarding the size of thoseareas detailed by Brown Cook said the highest_levels of leadership within the Pentagon have discussed the Special_Operations forces locations with the Russians but refrained from saying when those discussions took_place Brown however said that the Russians have been made aware of the Special_Operations forces presence within Syria around the same_time the Pentagon announced their deployment in December[]In October roughly a month after Russia started airstrikes in Syria the Pentagon and the Russian Ministry of Defense established a memorandum of understanding that outlined specific safety protocols for air crews to follow so that Russian and US aircraft could avoid one another in the rapidly crowding skies over SyriaAccording to Cook at the time of thememorandums announcement the document specifically did_not establish zones of cooperation intelligence sharing or any sharing of target information in SyriaOn Thursday Cook explained that giving the Special_Operations forces location to the Russians was the only instance in whichthe United_States has gone outside the framework of the original memorandum He said it was doneto provide additional safety to US forces operating on the ground[]Though Russian airstrikes have been largely directed toward supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assads ground forces some airstrikes have hit the Islamic_State in areas where US aircraft are operating It is unclear how close Russian aircraft have flown to US ground forces if they have at allThe White_House authorized the deployment of approximately 50 Special_Operations troops to northern Syria late last_year to help assess and potentiallytrain US-backed local forces fighting the Islamic_State The location of the Special_Operations troops has been kept largely secret for security purposes and details of their mission have not been disclosedThe Pentagon unveiled a proposal Tuesday to boost spending on advanced weaponry and the US footprint in Europe part of a plan to refocus the defense budget to counter technological and military advances by Russia and ChinaOn Tuesday Defense_Secretary Ashton B Carter previewed the Pentagon budget proposal for fiscal 2017 making a case for why Chinas rapid military buildup and Russias_intervention beyond its borders pose a bigger dangerto US security and merit larger investments than does the immediate threatfrom the Islamic StateWe dont have the luxury of just one opponent or the choice between current fights and future fights Carter said in an address at the Economic Club of Washington We have to do bothThe proposal reflects Carters attempt to broaden the militarys focus to include not just the insurgent conflicts of the post-2001 era but also higher-end threats from Russia and China whose military innovation US officials acknowledge has at times out-paced the United StatesA senior defense official who like others spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the plans said the advances made by Russia and China do force a competition that has to be confronted in the next decadeAlmost half of the new investments Carter will propose are related to what officials see as a growing threat from Moscow where President_Vladimir Putin has demonstrated his willingness to employ Russian military might from Ukraine to SyriaDespite repeated cease-fire agreements the conflict in Ukrainethere between Russian-backed separatists and the government in KievIf approved by Congress the budget plan would quadruple funding to bolster the American military presence in Europe under an initiative Obama introduced in the wake of Russias move into Ukraine in 2014Under the proposed expansion to the European Reassurance Initiative which would grow to $34 billion in 2017 under the new budget plan the Pentagon would increase the US troop presence in Europe expand positioning of combat vehicles and other equipment there help allies build up military infrastructure and train more allied troopsIn addition to the 62000 active_duty service_members stationed in 12 European nations the Pentagon has had about 10000-15000 extraforces there since the summer of 2014While Obamas 2014initiative was welcomed by allies near Russias borders it also stirred fears of a new arms race with an unpredictable power on the edge of EuropeA senior administration official said the expanded US presence was a result of more_than a year of studying what European defenses require This is not really a provocation or an escalation the official said Rather it is the result of our longer term response to Russias foreign interventionsThe Obama_administration also hopes the expanded American presence will prompt European countries to increase their own military spendingThe budget also seeks to chart a course for countering the military advances Russia and China have made in recent_years not only in building up traditional military assets but also in areas such as cyber It is fundamental for our department is to out-innovate and to stay ahead the first official saidUnder the new spending plan the Pentagon would spend $714 billion on research and development in 2017 an increase of about $13 billion In making those investment officials appear to be favoring smaller-scale unmanned systems such as a newly developed micro-drone That tiny hand-held device is made by 3D printing and can be dropped in swarms out of a fighter jet at high speedsOther new technology investments include a high-speed projectile that can be fired from existing Navy guns to protect against incoming missiles an alternative to more expensive missile defenses such as the Patriot Officials also hope to invest tens of billions of dollars in coming years on underwater weapons and enhancing weaponry on existing vesselsThe emphasis on maritime technologies comes as the Obama_administration faces mounting pressure to mount a more muscular response to While its military spending is still smaller than Washingtons China has enjoyed double-digit increases in its defense budget recent_years placing a special emphasis on building itself as a as it asserts ever-wider territorial claims in disputed watersJust last_week the Pentagon sent a missile destroyer in the South China_Sea in response to Chinese claims thereThe fiscal 2017 budget is likely to be the sole budget developed and presented by Carter the academic and longtime defense technocrat took_office nearly a year ago and is likely to step down with President Obama in early 2017Todd Harrison a defense spending expert at the Center for International and Strategic Studies cautioned that while Carters budget proposal may help shape the debate about future defense spending it may have limited impactThe department may start down a certain path but youre going to have a new team next year and theyre likely to shift the course slightly he saidHarrison said that Carter who appears to be opting for investments in technology and innovation rather_than trying to protect a larger force would have to manage friction with some military leaders over his approach to the Pentagons future Carter is already with his Navy secretary Ray Mabus in part over his plans to shift away from a ship the Pentagons top leadership say lacks firepower Service chiefs and the heads of regional commands such as US Central Command meanwhile are grappling with a host of dangers such as an expanding network of Islamic_State affiliates with limited resourcesThe services and combatant commanders they tend to be more worried about the near term because its their problem Harrison said The long term belongs to someone elseCarters budget would provide a 50 percentincrease to proposed spending against the Islamic_State in 2017 to $75 billion Part of that would go to replacing spent munitions $18 billion for buying 45000 smart bombs and laser-guided rocketsand funding an expansion of The plan would also increase spending on cyber capabilities to around $7 billion an increase of nearly $1 billion That would include efforts to make the Pentagons electronic infrastructurewhich like other parts of the US government in the last yearmore secure and to boost offensive cyber capabilitiesJon W Davidsons work day began at 630 am Pacifictime on Wednesday moments after President Trumpmade the unexpected announcement onTwitter that he would from serving in the militaryDavidson legal director of the LGBT rights group Lambda Legal was stillprocessing thepresidents out-of-the-blue tweets when the worried emails started pouring into his inbox Somecame from troops fearing discharge others from people just trying to wrap their heads around Trumps decisionAround 9 pm more_than 14 hours later Davidson said he had just finished reading all the messagesWere hearing from all sorts of transgender_people today asking things like Did I just getfired by tweet Davidson told The Washington_Post People are scared They dont_know what this really meansAcross the country attorneys and advocacy groups like Lambda are gearing up to challenge Trumps decision in court saying potential plaintiffs are already lining up to file suit Theyargue itruns afoul of the Constitutions Equal Protection and Due Process clauses discriminates against a vulnerable group and lacks the rational basis necessaryto be upheld by federal judgesThe only thing keeping them from the courthouse for now is the ambiguity of the announcement The president has issued no executive_order no policy memo no guidance no rulemaking just a stringof tweets in classic Trump fashionAt the first sign of a formal policy Davidson and others areprepared to sue the government on behalf of current transgender_service members and those seeking to enlist The rush of litigation if it comes could wind up resembling the flurry of lawsuits filed by immigration advocates after Trump issued his travel_ban earlier_this year many of them fighting detentions and deportations and challenging the legality of the executive orderWe believe that anysuch change in policy would be absolutely unconstitutional Davidson said of the transgender ban and it violates fundamental notions of fairness in the militaryThe LGBT military group OutServe-SLDN said it would join the effort in a heartbeat along with the National Center for Lesbian Rights which called the move a bizarre assault on these dedicated service_members The American Civil Liberties Unionalso threatened to file suitcalling on transgender services members to get in touch with the organizationThis isan outrageous and desperate action ACLU senior staff attorney Joshua Block said in a There is no basis for turning trans people away from our military and the ACLU is examining all of our options on how to fight thisTrumps Twitter fiat would reverse a year-old Obama_administration decision to allow transgender military membersto serve_openly and it could result in thousands of active-duty troops being discharged as reported WednesdayIn his tweets the president offered two rationales for the move medical_costs and disruptionPlease be advised that the United_States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the US Military Trumpwrote Our_military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous_medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entailPressed byreporters on how such a policy would be carried_out White_House spokeswoman_Sarah Huckabee_Sanders said there was no implementation plan yet and did_not discuss Wednesday whether current transgender_troops would be allowed to continue serving Thousands of service_members are transgender with as many as 11000 in the reserves and active-duty military according to a recent Pentagon-commissioned studyJohn Culhane a constitutional law professor at Delaware Law School predicted the Trump administration may soon learn that singling out a class of people for exclusion violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection under the law In a commentary for on Wednesday Culhane noted that untold numbers of transgender soldiers came out and others enlisted as a result of the Obama_administration policy that allowed them to serve_openly Dischargingthem he wrote would create problems of reliance the legal principle of acting on anothers promiseIf trans people are discharged lawsuits will follow Culhane wrote Even if they arent we can expect attorneys to seek a declaration from courts that no such discharges would be legalCourts give extra deference to the military on personnel matters but that doesnt_mean the military is above the law according toSarah Warbelow the Human Rights Campaigns legal director who told that Trumps declaration amounted to discrimination on the basis of sex and identityDavidson of Lambda echoed her remarks saying that while Trump had considerable powers as commander in chief military policies arefar from unreviewable in courtDavidson also argued that Trumps reasons for enacting a ban on transgender_people in the military were demonstrably false andwould beincorporated in his groups challengeTransgender people have been serving openly for a year and there have been no disruptions he said That disproves this notion that theres some threat to military readiness and unit cohesionIn the event that Trumps proposal doeswind up in federal court its not clear how the administration would defend it Sanders the White_House spokeswoman offered the faintest of hints Wednesday telling reporters that the presidents decision focused solely on military readinessLook I_think sometimes you have to make decisions and once he made a decision he didnt feel it was necessary to hold that decision and theyre_going to work together with the Department of Defense to lawfully implement it Sanders said She added that Trump had informedDefense Secretary_Jim Mattis of his move on TuesdayMattis who was on vacationdidnt comment on the issue Wednesday The Pentagon referred questions about Trumps tweets back to the White HouseIn the interest of fairness it would be helpful to include more details here elucidating Trumps decision but such insights are hard to come byFor the time being Davidson and other civil_rights attorneys have stressed that nothing about existing military policy has changed yet and that the presidents tweetscarry no force of lawIts so strange to be dealing with a situation and youre not sure what to believe is true and whether hell do what he says hes going to do Davidson said Were in an

(@TonyAtamanuik)What was finally real was Edgar Welch driving from North Carolina to Washington to rescue sexually abused children he believed were hidden in mysterious tunnels beneath a neighborhood pizza jointWhat was real was Welch a father former firefighter and sometime movie actor who was drawn to dark mysteries he found on the Internet terrifying customers and workers with his assault-style rifle as he searched Comet_Ping Pong police said He found no hidden children no secret chambers no_evidence of a child sex ring run by the failed Democratic candidate for president of the United_States or by her campaign chief or by the owner of the pizza placeWhat was false were the rumors he had read stories that crisscrossed the globe about a charming little pizza place that features ping-pong tables in its back roomThe story of Pizzagate is about what is fake and what is real Its a tale of a scandal that never was and of a fear that has spread through channels that did_not even exist until recentlyPizzagate the belief that code words and satanic symbols point to a sordid underground along an ordinary retail strip in the nations capital is possible only because science has produced the most_powerful tools ever invented to find and disseminate informationWhat brought Welch to the District on a crisp Sunday afternoon in early December was a choking mix of rumor political nastiness technological change and the intoxicating thrill that can come from running down a mysteryHis actions Sunday in one of Washingtons wealthiest neighborhoods reminded Americans that last months election did_not quite conclude the strangest political season in the nations history Welch did_not shoot anyone in the disturbance on Connecticut Avenue NW but he delivered a troubling message about the shattering of trust in a troubled time On Oct_28 FBI_Director James_B Comey told Congress that he was reopening the investigation of Hillary_Clintons use of a private email_server when she was secretary of state New emails had been found on a computer belonging to disgraced former New_York congressman Anthony_Weiner the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin Two days later someone tweeting under the handle @DavidGoldbergNY cited rumors that the new emails point to a pedophilia ring and @HillaryClinton is at the center The rumor was retweeted more_than 6000 timesThe notion quickly moved to other social-media platforms including 4chan and Reddit mostly through anonymous or pseudonymous posts On the far-right site Infowars talk-show host Alex Jones repeatedly suggested that Clinton was involved in a child sex ring and that her campaign_chairman John_Podesta indulged in satanic ritualsWhen I_think about all the children Hillary_Clinton has personally murdered and chopped up and raped I have zero fear standing up against her Jones said in posted on Nov 4 Yeah you heard me right Hillary_Clinton has personally murdered children I just cant hold back the truth anymore Jones eventually tied his comments about Clinton to US policy in SyriaAccording to YouTube that video has been viewed more_than 427000 timesOver the next couple of days the wild accusations against Clinton gradually merged with a new raft of allegations stemming from WikiLeaks release of Podestas emails Those emails showed that Podesta occasionally dined at Comet_Ping PongOn Nov7 the hashtag #pizzagate first appeared on Twitter Over the next several weeks it would be tweeted and retweeted hundreds or thousands of times each day An oddly disproportionate share of the tweets about Pizzagate appear to have come from of all places the Czech Republic Cyprus and Vietnam said Jonathan Albright an assistant professor of media analytics at Elon University in North Carolina In some cases the most avid retweeters appeared to be bots programs designed to amplify certain news and informationWhat bots are doing is really getting this thing trending on Twitter Albright said These bots are providing the online crowds that are providing legitimacyOnline the more something is retweeted or otherwise shared the more prominently it appears in social_media and on sites that track trending news As the bots joined ordinary Twitter users in pushing out Pizzagate-related rumors the notion spread like wildfire Who programmed the bots to focus on that topic remains unknown On the Friday before the election James Alefantis who owns two restaurants on the same block in upper Northwest Washington noticed something odd in his Instagram feed a stream of comments calling him a pedophileUpset Alefantis told some of his young employees at Comet_Ping Pong about the hateful comments and they poked around online They found rapidly burgeoning discussions on Reddit 4chan and Instagram about a purported child sex ring operating out of their restaurantAlefantis who grew up in an affluent section of the District was no stranger to politics He had held a fundraiser for the Clinton campaign at Comet Hed had a relationship with David Brock the erstwhile Clinton nemesis who had a midcareer political conversion and became a pro-Clinton advocate And Alefantis had lots of customers and friends in liberal Democratic circlesWhen Alefantis opened Comet a decade_ago hed had a run-in with an advisory neighborhood commissioner a local official who did_not like it when Comet put ping-pong tables on the sidewalk That commissioner had warned that having game tables on the sidewalk might bring rapes and murders to the virtually crime-free neighborhoodNow a decade later a Washington_Post column about that dispute was trending on Twitter Somewhere out there thousands of people were hungrily searching the Internet for anything remotely troubling about Comet_Ping PongIn the final days before the election other shopkeepers on the block began to receive threatening phone_calls and disturbing emails Strangers from faraway places demanded to know about symbols on their shop windows or photos on their wallsAcross from Comet at the French bistro Terasol co-owner Sabrina Ousmaal noticed a disturbing Google review of her restaurant that alleged that Terasol too was involved in a plot to abuse childrenThen more online comments appeared focusing on a photo on Terasols website that showed Ousmaal and her daughter posing with Clinton who had eaten there several years earlier The Internet sleuths also fixated on a heart logo that appeared on the restaurants site as part of a fundraiser for St Jude Childrens Research Hospital which Ousmaal a cancer survivor has supported for yearsThese maniacs thought that was a symbol of child pornography said her_husband and business_partner Alan Moin Its crazyThe family removed the symbol from their site but the online comments adapted to the new reality Terasol must be hiding something The anonymous calls increasedWhat can we do Ousmaal said There is no basement There is no tunnel There is nothingAlefantis and other merchants were mystified Where was this all coming from Cant anyone make it stopThe merchants approached Facebook and Twitter and asked that disparaging fictitious comments about them be removed The shopkeepers said the replies they got advised them to block individual users who were harassing themThe owner of 4chan Hiroyuki Nishimura said in an email to The_Post that Pizzagate reminds me that a country indicated [there were] stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and many people and countries were deceived It is same old storyNishimura a Japanese Internet entrepreneur said the rumors about Comet could be false Some people who believe they do something good may be deceived by false information But he said their motive was good they did it for saving childrenOn Connecticut Avenue the hate calls and death threats kept mounting Surely the shopkeepers thought this will all go away after the election On Election_Day Brittany Pettibone a right-wing online activist in California who writes science-fiction novels with her twin sister tweeted drawings of children under the label Sexualized children child abuse pools and bondage She wrote that the images were a look inside Hillary_Clintons friend Tony Podestas house Tony_Podesta a Washington lobbyist is Johns brotherPettibone attached the hashtag #PizzaGate We_need to expose this she wrote in another tweetDozens of commenters responded almost immediately How do we make this VIRAL one wroteSeveral of the most frequent and prominent purveyors of the Pizzagate rumors said they first learned about the supposed conspiracy from Pettibones postingsI was one of the first Pettibone said in a brief conversation Tuesday She said she would not take part in an_interview Im uninclined to speak to mainstream media because during the election cycle they made the right look like nut jobs because we suspected Hillary had a health issue and it turned_out she didFor a few_days after Donald Trumps victory a relative calm returned to Comet But along the block merchants were hearing from all manner of strange callers At Besta Pizza owner Abdel Hammad got an urgent message from the company that maintains his website A reviewer alleged that his shops simple pizza-shaped logo was a symbol of child pornography Hammad an Egyptian immigrant who voted for Trump was stunnedIts a slice of pizza he saidHammad removed the image from his site but could not afford more_than $2000 to pay for new signs out frontWhy did you change the website anonymous callers screamed at him on the phoneWere going to put a bullet in your head one threatenedDown the block at Politics and Prose Bookstore employees noticed tweets and other online posts that included them on a list of stores linked by underground tunnels that do not existThe fact that one of the shops co-owners Lissa Muscatine had worked as Clintons speechwriter and adviser for two_decades quickly became one more data point in the Pizzagate activists conspiracy theoryThe shops phone rang off the hook with profane abusive calls from across the country Employees simply hung up over and overFrustrated and frightened merchants along the block talked to the police They called the FBI which said the threats were a local matter On Nov16 Jack Posobiec a former Navy Reserve intelligence_officer who had spent much of the previous year as a leader of a pro-Trump grass-roots organization decided hed had enough of just reading tweets and blog posts about the pizza place in his cityPosobiec 31 had never eaten at Comet he had never even heard of the place until he started reading about it on conservative antigovernment media sites I didnt pay much attention to it before Election_Day because I was focused on the campaign he said With that going on who wants to talk about pizzaNow with Trump elected he read the posts more closely Any story that accused Clinton John_Podesta and Brock of nefarious deeds deserved some investigation he thought He believed the Clinton campaign was full of secrecy and deceptionIt seemed reasonable to Posobiec that Podesta might have organized a sex ring in cahoots with Brock But the only part of the scenario that was real was that Podesta had been known to eat pizza at Comet This part is false pictures purporting to show that symbols such as butterflies and spirals in signs at Comet and other shops were statements about pedophiliaPosobiec said he was curious and confused He and a friend decided to go have some pizza They walked into Comet eight days after the election sat down and ordered Posobiec got the garlic knots His friend got a beer But they were not just hanging out Posobiec was using his phone to broadcast his evening at Comet on Periscope an app that allows users to stream video livePart of the experience of living in 2016 is live on-the-scene broadcasts he said People have lost faith with government and the mainstream media being any real authority After the Iraq War after Benghazi people are searching for other sources of information If I can do something with Periscope and show what Im seeing with my own two eyes thats helpfulPosobiec said he never made any disturbance inside Comet but the restaurants managers saw him take his camera into a back room where a childs birthday party was underway It did_not seem appropriate for a childs party to be broadcast on a strangers Periscope feed The manager asked two DC police officers who happened to be across the street to assistPosobiec and his friend were gently refused service and asked to leave said a person_familiar with the restaurants decisionPosobiec offered to pay for what he had ordered The manager said it was on the housePosobiec said he was not there to make a scene I didnt have any preconceived notions he said I wasnt sure I thought I could just show it was a regular pizza placeThat evening after Posobiec was ushered out of Comet Pettibone tweeted Youre my hero for doing this Jack Never let goOn Twitter the hashtag #pizzagate peaked in the hours after Posobiecs video appearedOn Nov22 Reddit closed its r/pizzagate subreddit a site forum focused on a particular topic The site said it was concerned that Pizzagate posts were revealing private information about people at Comet and nearby stores We dont_want witch-hunts on our site it said The decision sparked allegations of censorship from some people who were spreading the Pizzagate rumors They moved their discussion to a similar site Voat On Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend two_men carrying protest signs showed up outside CometAlefantis went outside and offered the men coffee They declined the offerOn the phone and online threats poured in with as many as 150 calls a dayThe shopkeepers approached DC police for

started preaching at them aggressivelyDanielle Tillman 23 was the best friend of Welchs girlfriend She said she had just taken acid when Welch got upset chanting Jesus name at herHe grabbed my hand and got in my face and was like Let the demons out of her Tillman recalled It was super weirdWelch known to friends as Maddison had struck friends as a sweet young man whod had trouble finding his way He had dabbled in acting his father ran a small movie studio out of his house and in writing and firefighting None of it stuck He liked to hike long stretches out West through mountain ranges over rivers into national forestsA few years_ago he told his hometown newspaper that through hiking he had broken his addiction to the InternetBut Welch had another habit He was arrested several_times on drug-possession charges and his name appeared on a forged prescription according to police records He was convicted of marijuana possession and public drinking and was sent to a substance-abuse programFriends say Welch 28 in recent months grew far more outwardly religious He sees himself as someone who is a protector said his friend Charles Dobson 28 He is just a thrill-seeking guyOn his Facebook page Welch has posted biblical verses and psalms some related to the end of days along with photos of his two children Only by your power can we push back our enemies one verse reads Only in your name can we trample our foesA few years_ago Welch told a longtime friend and former roommate Dane Granberry about stories he had read online describing miles of secret tunnels under the Denver airport Welch who had also been fascinated by conspiracy theories about the Sept11 2001 attacks having been staged by the United_States had become obsessed with the tunnels idea and spent long hours reading articles watching videos and searching for detailsHes into doing his own research Granberry said I dont_think he has very much faith in the media but none of us do Granberry said her friend needed to see things for himselfOn Friday or Saturday Welch drove to the District according to court testimony He showed up at Comet on Sunday about 3 pmGareth Wade 47 and Doug Clarke 50 were sitting down for pizza and beer when a server told them that someone had walked in with a gun As Welch passed by their table he told them to vacate the building They rushed outOutside dozens of DC police officers swarmed the area evacuating businesses and blocking off streets A police helicopter circled overheadInside Comet Welch armed with a Colt AR-15 assault rifle a 38-caliber Colt revolver and a folding knife fired his gun two or three_times police saidWelch dressed in jeans a T-shirt and a hooded sweatshirt remained inside for about 45 minutes searching for underground vaults or hidden rooms police said At least one gunshot broke off a lock to a door It led not to hidden sex workers but to a computer room The bullet damaged a computer towerAt some point a Comet worker who had been in the back freezer retrieving dough and had missed the earlier commotion heard the shots and emerged into the restaurant Welch swung the rifle in his direction and the worker fled out onto the avenue police saidFinally Welch responded to police calls for him to leave the building and surrender He put his AR-15 on top of a beer keg and his revolver on a table He came out with his hands up following police commands to walk backward toward themWelch was handcuffed and Sgt Benjamin Firehock asked him why he had done it Welch said according to the arrest affidavit that he had read online that the Comet restaurant was harboring child sex slaves and that he wanted to see for himself if they were there [Welch] stated that he was armed to help rescue them [Welch] surrendered peacefully when he found no_evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurantWithin hours of Welchs arrest online conspiracy theorists had already decided that he was not one of them Some suggested he was a false flag a government plant an enemy of their cause who had been used in an elaborate plot to conceal the truthFor years people have made similar claims about everything from the 9/11 attacks (a government conspiracy to justify war they say) to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting (a government conspiracy to justify gun control they say)Now in Welchs case the conspiracy theorists insisted that the real news about his dangerous assault was in fact fake newsComet Ping Pong reopened Tuesday night the crowd was large and supportive For some months now Stefanie MacWilliams 24 a stay-at-home mother of a 1-year-old boy in Ontario has written nearly every day usually about politics for Planet Free Will a conservative website based in the United_States Her husband a mechanic is the familys main breadwinner but MacWilliams has been earning some money too writing a lot about how good Trump would be for America and a fair amount about how bad President Obama wasStarting in early November MacWilliams noticed that stories based on the Podesta emails were making waves A friend who knows Im interested in politics and shares conspiracy things with me sent MacWilliams stories about Comet_Ping PongThen she happened upon Posobiecs live stream from Comet This she decided was a story She told the Pizzagate tale in a YouTube video on Twitter and on Planet Free WillIn the third paragraph of her story MacWilliams wrote that we must stress that there is as yet no concrete evidence of any wrongdoing She thought she was being quite responsible She had read Internet chatter about strange happenings and code words and she thought this needed investigation She was miffed that Posobiec had been escorted out of Comet when his video tour might have gotten to the bottom of the mysteryMacWilliamss story spread via social_media She became part of what she called a worldwide citizen investigation of PizzagateWhen she saw Reddit and Twitter react to the conspiracy theory respectively shutting down a discussion forum and suspending the accounts of some users she worried that a coverup was underway As soon as you tell people they cant talk about something theyre_going to talk about it a whole lot more she saidMacWilliams calls herself a journalist but she does_not try to be 100_percent accurate either She believes the beauty of the Internet is that people can crowdsource the truth Eventually what is real will emerge she saidPizzagate she said is two worlds clashing People dont trust the mainstream media anymore but its true that people shouldnt take the alternative media as truth either The lack of stories about Pizzagate in the mainstream press meant that the back channels of the Internet would step into the breachBut how does this end What could constitute proof that there is no conspiracy Some Pizzagate buffs want a video tour showing that there are no secret rooms or tunnels Others say they would need moreMacWilliams remains caught up in the thrill of the chase There is a camaraderie to it she said It is like sitting around with your friends saying What really happened to JFK It is like a giant game especially nowadays when you can crowdsource thousands of emails and figure out whats_going on Its like a real-life Kennedy assassination where all the stuff is at your fingertips and its happening todayWhen the New_York Times mentioned her site on Nov21 as a source of fake_news MacWilliams got a little angry but she also had reason to smile The traffic on Planet Free Will soared as never before The story is everywhere Some Americans especially keen on Pizzagate find themselves being accused of being Russian stooges or of working for hackers intent on disrupting the American political processIn a small city north of Tel Aviv in the small hours of the night Avrahaum Segol a New_Yorker who emigrated to Israel 15 years_ago makes call after call back to Washington He says he has never been to Comet_Ping Pong but he is

MorganSegol called the woman and spelled out his baroque story He quoted from an HG Wells story called and he wondered whether the symbols on the sign crescents and stars might reveal a message about sexual misdeeds or satanic ritualsThe woman listened to some of this then told Segol Youre an idiot She hung up on him He is undeterred He sends letters to the president of the United_States and the chief justice and to newspaper editors and reporters and to TV and radio hosts He calls The_Post to explain how the Supreme Courts ruling on same-sex marriage connects with the symbols on the Comet sign He calls to explain_why his family left him He calls to say why the death of a former CIA chief may be connected to Pizzagate He calls to ask whether the neighborhood around Comet is known for murderers and thievesWere living in such a queer time Segol said He said his investigation of Pizzagate is a work of art I tell my kids There are no mysteries only facts unknownHe asks to be contacted

extendedDirty air in India and China Tainted water in sub-Saharan Africa Toxic mining and smelter operations in South America Pollution around the globe now contributes toan estimated 9 million deaths annually or roughly one in six according to an in-depth published Thursday in the LancetIf accurate that means pollution kills three_times more people each year thanHIV/AIDS tuberculosis and malaria combined with most of those deaths in poor and developing countriesGoing into this my colleagues and I knew that pollution killed a lot of people But we certainly did_not have any idea of the total magnitude of the problem said Philip Landrigan dean of global health at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and co-chair of the commission behind the report I_think all of us were really surprised when we saw thisThe two-year project which relied on data from researchers in more_than 130 countries documenting the causes of disease and premature deaths in recent decades found that poor air quality was the most significant pollution-related killer That includes both outdoor pollution tainted by mercury arsenic and other harmful particulates and household air dirtied by the burning of wood dung and other organic materials The result An estimated 65 million deaths in 2015 from heart disease strokes lung cancer and other respiratory problemsWater pollution which includes everything from unsafe sanitation to contaminated drinking water accounted for an additional 18 million annual deaths from gastrointestinal diseases and other infections researchers foundPollution in the workplace also took a heavy toll on some of the worlds poorest workers From bladder cancer in dye workers to the lung disease pneumoconiosis in coal miners researchers found that occupational exposure tovarious carcinogens and toxins was linked to about 800000 deaths annuallyIn 2015 the largest number of deaths attributable to pollution occurred in India and China with an estimated 25 million and 18 million deaths respectively Other severely affected countries include Pakistan Bangladesh and KenyaBeyond the massive human toll the authors of Thursdays report also focused on thefinancial toll caused by pollution-related health problemsUntil now people havent recognized what an incredible hit pollution makes on the economy of a country Landrigan said Pollution control can stimulate the economy because it reduces death and diseaseThey estimated the hit to national budgets at about 13 percent of gross domestic product in low-income countries compared toabout05 percent in developed high-income countries In_addition nations facing crippling pollutiontend to spendmuch more on health_care to treat diseases related to the problemWhen youre looking at developing countries you really have to address this challenge if you want to move people out of poverty and into the middle class said Gina McCarthy a former Environmental Protection_Agency administrator who was not involved in the study but had studied its conclusions It is holding people backAnd the warming of the Earths climate is likely to fuel more deaths in the absence of international action she saidClimate change is going to exacerbate the very problems that are identified in this article There will be more contagious and infectious diseases There will be more lives lost more injuries if we dont identifya path that gets us out of the hole that were in McCarthy said Whatpeople dont realize is the instability that results from poverty the instability that results from migration as a result of climate changeThe startlingconclusion that pollution accounts for 16 percent of deaths worldwide is of course an estimate But the findings build on previous studies including a 2016 report from the World Health Organization detailing the extent to which pollution represents a public_health crisisIf countries do not take actions to make environments where people live and work healthy millions will_continue to become ill and die too young then-WHO Director-General Margaret Chan McCarthy said the Lancet study also is built on the most complete epidemiological data availableThese are the best numbers that we have available to us And even if theyre off by a factor of10 youre still talking_about huge huge impacts But theyre not off by a factor of 10 she said Its very clear if you go to other countries and its clear if you go to some of our own communities that they are being held back because of the impact of pollution on their kids and their elderly And we have to stop thinking that because we cant see the pollution and its not as visible that its not thereLandrigan said there is an old wives tale that developing countries inevitably suffer through troublesome pollution and disease on their way to becoming more prosperousRather he and the studys other authors insisted that countriesmustdo muchto reduce pollution and improve the health of their citizens and that they will reap economic benefits for doing so In_addition he said developed nations can play a meaningful role in helping poorer countries slash pollution and major nonprofit foundations that have largely steered clear of the problem must be convinced that it is a global priorityIt doesnt have to [get worse] Its not an inevitable outcome Landrigan said of the annual death toll Pollution control is a winnable battleThe Fact_Checker earlier produced as President Trumps national_security adviser Now that story has merged with Trumps firing of FBI_Director James_B Comey Below is a new timeline incorporating some elements of the Flynn timeline Key aspects of the Trump and Comey interactions remain in dispute so we will keep updating this as new information emerges The Obama_administration measures against Russia in retaliation for what US officials characterized as interference in the 2016 election ordering the expulsion of Russian intelligence operatives and slapping new sanctions on state agencies and individuals suspected in the hacks of US computer systemsFlynn incoming national_security adviser for Trump with Russias ambassador to the United_States Sergey_Kislyak and discusses the sanctions and suggests the possibility of sanctions relief once Trump is president The call is monitored by US intelligence_agencies Comey briefs Trump about the intelligence_community assessment concerning Russias efforts to intefere with the presidential_election Comey in written congressional testimony on June 8 says he was tasked to pull Trump aside and brief him on the contents of an unverified dossier that was personally sensitive to the president-elect Based on President-elect Trumps reaction to the briefing and without him directly asking the question Comey tells Trump he is not the subject of an open counter-intelligence investigation After the meeting Comey immediately wrote a memo about the conversation as sson as he returned to his car I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting and so I thought it really important to document he told lawmakers Trump takes the oath of office and becomes president Trump singles out Comey at a White_House event and hugs him Oh and theres Jim Hes become more famous than meTrump was presumably referring to Comeys announcement days before the election that the FBI might have found new information in the Hillary_Clinton email case Clinton and many other Democrats say Comeys announcement tipped a close election toward Trump) He tried hard to blend into the background and avoid any one-on-one interaction He was wearing a blue blazer and noticed that the drapes were blue So he stood in the back right in front of the drapes hoping Trump wouldnt notice him camouflaged against the wall Comey took the long walk across the room determined he told me that there was not going to be a hug Bad enough that he was there bad enough that there would be a handshake he emphatically did_not want any show of warmth Again look at the video and youll see Comey preemptively reaching_out to shake hands Trump grabs his hand and attempts an embrace The embrace however is entirely one sided Comey was disgusted He regarded the episode as a physical attempt to show closeness and warmth in a fashion calculated to compromise him before Democrats who already mistrusted him Flynn is interviewed by the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak Acting attorney_general Sally Yates accompanied by an aide goes to the White_House and tells White_House Counsel Donald McGahn that contrary to Flynns claims to White_House officials sanctions had been discussed in the calls based on the monitoring of the conversations by intelligence_agencies She also warns that Flynn is vulnerable to blackmail by Moscow McGahn asks Yates to come to the White_House again to discuss the matter further Yates testified that he did_not indicate whether he had discussed the Flynn situation with anyone_else at the White_House but White_House press secretarySean Spicer told_reporters the president was immediately informed of the situation McGahnasked why the Justice_Department would be concerned whether one White_House official lied to another she said Logic would tell_you that you dont_want the national_security adviser to be in a position where the Russians have leverage_over him she saidMcGahn also asks to see the underlying evidence Yates says she would work with the FBI to assemble the material and McGahns review is scheduled for Jan 30 That night Trump and Comey have dinner at the White_House But they disagree over who asked for the meeting He wanted to have dinner because he wanted to stay on We had a very nice dinner at the White_House That dinner was arranged I_think he asked for the dinner I was at the Hoover Building on the 27th of January for another event and spoke briefly with Director Comey He mentioned to me the invitation he had from the president for dinner and that he was my characterization uneasy with it both from a standpoint of the optic of compromising his independence and the independence of the FBIAt the dinner Trump reportedly asks Comey for his loyalty according to news reports The President began by asking me whether I wanted to stay on as FBI_Director which I found strange My instincts told me that the one-on-one setting and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position meant the dinner was at_least in part an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship That concerned me greatly given the FBIs traditionally independent status in the executive branchI added that I was not on anybodys side politically and could not be counted on in the traditional political sense a stance I said was in his best interest as the President A few moments later the President said I need loyalty I expect loyalty I didnt move speak or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed We simply looked at each_other in silenceNear the end of our dinner the President returned to the subject of my jobHe then said I need loyalty I replied You will always get honesty from me He paused and then said Thats what I want honest loyalty I paused and then said You will get that from meComey also indicated that he again told Trump he was not under investigation He said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didnt happen Comey recounted in his written testimony I replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally which we werent and because it was very difficult to prove a negativeI didnt but I dont_think it would be a bad question to ask I_think loyalty to the country loyalty to the United_States is important You_know I mean it depends on how you define loyalty Number one Number two I dont_know how that got there because I didnt ask that questionTrumps lawyer Marc Kasowitz said after Comeystestimony The president also never told Mr Comey quote I need loyalty I expect loyalty closed quote He never said it in for and he never said it in substance Trump fires Yates allegedly over an unrelated matter her conclusion that Trumps executive_order barring travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries was unlawful The executive_order is later blocked by the courts The Washington_Post that the White_House had known for weeks that Flynn had misled people about the nature of the Kislyak calls Flynn is forced to resign within hours after the article is posted Spicer on Feb 14 said Flynn was let go because he no_longer had the trust of the president and vice_president In an Oval_Office meeting Trump asks Comey to end the investigation of Flynn according to Comey On February 14 I went to the Oval_Office for a scheduled counterterrorism briefing of the President Comey said in his congressional testimony The President signaled the end of the briefing by thanking the group and telling them all that he wanted to speak to me aloneWhen the door by the grandfather clock closed and we were alone the President began by saying I want to talk about Mike Flynn The President began by saying Flynn hadnt done anything wrong in speaking with the Russians but he had to let him go because he had misled the Vice_President He added that he had other concerns about Flynn which he did_not then specify He is a good guy and has been through a lot He repeated that Flynn hadnt done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians but had misled the Vice_President He then said I_hope you can see your way clear to letting this go to letting Flynn go He is a good guy I_hope you can let this go I replied only that he is a good guy I did_not say I would let this goUnder questioning by lawmakers Comey said that given the setting and the fact that Trump asked to see him alone he took the presidents words as a directive It rings in my ear as kind of Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest Comey said regarding Henry IIs alleged words that led to the murder of Thomas Becket the archbishop of Canterbury in 1170 He said that at time Flynn was in legal jeopardy Kasowitz said after Comeys testimony The president never in form or substance directed or suggested that Mr Comey stop investigating anyone including the president never suggested that Mr Comey quote Let Flynn go close quote Trump also he asked Comey to ease up on the investigation In a tweet Trump claims without evidence that President_Barack Obama had tapped his phones during the election campaign A day later news reports Comey asked the Justice_Department to publicly reject Trumps claim But no action is takenHow low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process This is Nixon/Watergate Bad (or_sick) guy Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) In congressional testimony Comey said he has been cleared by the Justice_Department to say there is no information to support Trumps claim about wiretaps He also the FBI was investigating the nature of any links_between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian_government and whether there was any coordination_between the campaign and Russias effortsAfter Comeys testimony Trump separately asked two of the nations top intelligence officials Daniel Coats director of national intelligence and Adm Michael S Rogers director of the National_Security Agency to help him push back against the FBI investigation He urgedthem to publicly deny the existence of any evidence of collusion during the 2016 election but both officials refused believing the request was inappropriate Comey says Trump called him This is a summary of his description of the call from his written congressional testimony on June 8On the morning of March 30 the President called me at the FBI He described the Russia investigation as a cloud that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country He said he had nothing to do with Russia had not been involved with hookers in Russia and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia He asked what we could do to lift the cloud I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those Congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating President Trump I reminded him I had previously told him that He repeatedly told me We_need to get that fact out The President went on to say that if there were some satellite associates of his who did something wrong it would be good to find that out but that he hadnt done anything wrong Comey says his last conversation with Trump took_place in a phone_call From his June 8 written testimonyOn the morning of April 11 the President called me and asked what I had done about his request that I get out that he is not personally under investigation I replied that I had passed his request to the Acting Deputy_Attorney General but I had not heard back He replied that the cloud was getting in the way of his ability to do his job I said the White_House Counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make the request which was the traditional channel He said he would do that and added Because I have been very loyal to you very loyal we had that thing you know I did_not reply or ask him what he meant by that thing I said only that the way to handle it was to have the White_House Counsel call the Acting Deputy_Attorney General He said that was what he would do and the call ended Trump knocks Comey on TwitterFBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary_Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds The phony Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Comey It makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election He offers a defense of his actions in the Hillary_Clinton case and indicates the Russian investigation is continuing Trump tells Attorney_General Jeff_Sessions and Deputy_Attorney General_Rod J_Rosenstein that he wants to fire_Comey Rosenstein crafts that faults Comey for his handling of the Clinton case although he has refused to say whether anyone asked him to write the memo The White_House originally cited the memo as justification for the firing but then later backed off that explanation after Rosenstein complained Comey is fired In his note to Comey Trump says I greatly appreciate you informing me on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation (Trump appears to be referring to the conversations recounted by Comey on Jan 6 Jan 27 and March 30) Trump meets with Russian officials including Foreign_Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Kislyak I just fired the head of the FBI Trump says He was crazy a real nut job I faced great pressure because of Russia Thats taken offTrump adds Im not under investigation Rosenstein appoints a special_counsel former FBI_director Robert_S Mueller_III to overseethe Russia probe and investigate anyrelated matters such as obstruction of justice and perjury()Russian President_Vladimir Putin found a moment Thursday during a wide-ranging news_conference to offer a strong endorsement of Republican front-runner Donald Trump calling the billionaire presidential_candidate the absolute leader in the presidential racePutin consecrated a between the two_men as he commented on the US campaign for the White_House saying that Russia would work with whomever the American voters choose but expressing special praise for TrumpTrump said in October that he would get along very well with Putin and applauded the Russian leader for his intervention against the Islamic_State in Syria But until Thursday Trumps praise had gone unreciprocatedHes a very lively man talented without doubt Putin said when journalists approached him after the news_conference and asked about Trump Hes saying he wants to go to another level of relations closer deeper relations with Russia How can we not welcome that Of_course we welcome thatIt was a moment of levity during a more_than three-hour news_conference that touched on Russias battered economy Russias_intervention in Syria tense relations with Turkey over the downing of a Russian warplane and the smoldering conflict in Ukraine During the news_conference Putin denied once_again that regular Russian forces were in Ukraine where pro-Moscow rebels began clashes with the Western-backed government in 2014 But Putin hinted that Russian military advisers or security forces were active in that country an involvement that he and senior Russian officials have sharply denied in the pastWe never said that we did_not have people there who are dealing with certain issues Putin said of southeastern Ukraine the base for the Russian-backed separatists But there are no regular Russian troops there Feel the differencePutins statement came after a Ukrainian journalist passed on a hello from Captain Erofeyev and Sergeant Alexandrov two alleged Russian servicemen captured by Ukrainian government forces Russia has said they quit the army before going to Ukraine The format of the yearly news_conference is a spectacle in itself Nearly 1400 journalists jostle on national television for the opportunity to ask Putin a questionPutin answers in monologues that can stretch as long as 10 minutes making it difficult for reporters to follow upAsked about Russias_intervention in the civil_war in Syria Putin said Russian forces would remain there at_least until a democratic process is launchedThere is a plan Putin said In its key aspects it coincides with the American plan working on the constitution preparing elections in Syria and the recognition of their results But for now we are going to launch strikes and support the Syrian army in its offensiveBut the United_States and Russia differ sharply over Syrian President Bashar al-Assad Washington and its allies insist that Assad has no role in Syrias political future Russia and Iran however are key backers of Assad and will likely resist any outcome that lessens their influence in Syria Russia began airstrikes to back Assad in September but recently Russian analysts and government officials have expressed frustration with the slow speed of the offensive and ineffectiveness of the Syrian troopsIn a closed-door meeting before parliament on Wednesday Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu declined to put a time limit on the intervention but said that Russia cant count on a quick conclusion to the operation the RIA Novosti state news_agency reportedA day earlier Putin met with Secretary of State John_F Kerry striking an agreement to hold talks Friday in New_York on a political settlement that may then be formalized in a United_Nations resolutionPutin largely reiterated Russias anger over the downing of one of its warplanes by Turkish jets last_month Life has shown that it is difficult for us practically impossible to come to terms with the incumbent Turkish administration Putin said Even when and where we say that we agree they stab us in the side or in the back for absolutely unclear reasonsHe said that someone in the Turkish government may have ordered the attack on the Russian plane in an effort to please the United_States or as he put it to lick the Americans in a particular placePutin also addressed Russias economy which has been hit with high inflation and plunged against the dollar and euro as the price of oil has fallen drastically in recent months While the dollar was worth 35 rubles two years_ago it now trades at more_than 70 rublesPutin said that he was satisfied with the leadership of Russias government and the Central Bank which steeply hiked interest_rates to prevent inflation despite the pain that the move has dealt to businesses and borrowers He said he wanted to lower interest_rates but that this would happen only when Russia could do so in a natural way Putin predicted that Russia would have 07 percent growth in 2016 19 percent growth in 2017 and 24 percent growth in 2018 But he made those predictions with oil trading at $50 a barrel Brent crude was trading at just over $37 a barrel on ThursdayIn a personal moment Putin was asked about the identity of his daughters after a series of investigations in the Russian press revealed that a woman named Katerina Tikhonova had attained a prominent position overseeing millions of dollars in investment at a high-tech business incubator at Moscow State UniversityThey dont engage in business and they dont engage in politics Putin said declining to say whether Tikhonova was his daughter They are never going to get involved in thatMaya

law_enforcement investigation_into possible_coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign has identified a current White_House official as a significant person of interest showing that the probe is reaching into the highest_levels of government according to people_familiar with the matterThe senior White_House adviser under_scrutiny by investigators is someone close to the president according to these people who would not further identify the official The revelation comes as the investigation appears to be entering a more overtly active phase with investigators shifting from work that has remained largely hidden from the public to conducting interviews and using a grand_jury to issue subpoenas The intensity of the probe is expected to accelerate in the coming weeks the people saidThe sources emphasized that investigators remain keenly interested in people who previously wielded influence in the Trump campaign and administration but are no_longer part of it including former national_security adviser_Michael Flynn and former campaign_chairman Paul ManafortFlynn resigned in February after disclosures that he had lied to administration officials about his contacts with Russian_Ambassador Sergey_Kislyak Current administration officials who have acknowledged contacts with Russian officials include President Trumps_son-in-law Jared_Kushner as well as Attorney_General Jeff_Sessions and Secretary of State_Rex Tillerson People familiar_with the investigation said the intensifying effort does_not mean criminal_charges are near or that any such charges will result Earlier this week Deputy_Attorney General_Rod J_Rosenstein appointed former FBI_director Robert_S Mueller_III to serve as special_counsel and lead the investigation_into Russian_meddling It is unclear exactly how Muellers leadership will affect the direction of the probe and he is already bringing in new people to work on the team Those familiar_with the case said its significance had increased before Muellers appointment Although the case began quietly last July as an effort to determine_whether any Trump associates coordinated with Russian operatives to meddle in the presidential_election campaign the investigative work now being done by the FBI also includes determining whether any financial crimes were committed by people close to the president The people_familiar with the matter said the probe has sharpened into something more fraught for the White_House the FBI and the Justice_Department particularly because of the public steps investigators know they now need to take the people saidWhen subpoenas are issued or interviews are requested it is possible the people being asked to talk or provide documents will reveal publicly what they were asked about A small_group of lawmakers known as the Gang of Eight was notified of the change in tempo and focus in the investigation at a classified briefing Wednesday evening the people_familiar with the matter said Then-FBI Director_James B_Comey in March Justice_Department spokeswoman_Sarah Isgur_Flores said I cant confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of investigations or targets of investigations An FBI spokesman declined to comment White_House spokesman Sean_Spicer said As the president has stated before a thorough investigation will confirm that there was no collusion_between the campaign and any foreign entityWhile there has been a loud public debate in recent_days over in his private dealings with Comey whom Trump fired last_week people_familiar with the matter said investigators on the case are more focused on Russian influence operations and possible financial crimesThe FBIs investigation seeks to determine_whether and to what extent Trump associates were what business_dealings they might have had in Russia and whether they in any way facilitated the hacking and publishing of emails from the Democratic_National Committee and Hillary_Clintons campaign_chairman John_Podesta during the presidential campaign Several congressional_committees are also investigating though their probes could not produce criminal_charges A grand_jury in Alexandria_Va recently issued a subpoena for records related to Flynns business the Flynn Intel Group which was paid more_than $500000 by a company owned by a Turkish American businessman close to top Turkish officials according to people_familiar with the matterThe Flynn Intel Group was paid for research on Fethullah Gulen a cleric who Turkeys current president believes was responsible for a coup attempt last_summer Flynn retroactively registered with the Justice_Department in March as a paid foreign agent for Turkish interests Separately from the probe now run by Mueller Flynn is being investigated by the Pentagons top watchdog for his foreign payments Flynn also received $45000 to appear in 2015 with Russian President_Vladimir Putin at a dinner for RT a Kremlin-controlled media organization Flynn discussed US sanctions against Russia with Russias ambassador to the United_States during the month before Trump took_office and he withheld that fact from the vice_president That prompted then-acting attorney_general Sally Yates to Flynn after The Washington_Post reported on the contents of the call The president has nonetheless seemed to defend his former adviser A memo by Comey alleged that Trump asked that the probe into Flynn be shut_down The White_House also has acknowledged that Kushner met with Kislyak the Russian_ambassador to the United_States in late November Kushner also has acknowledged that he met with the head of a Russian development bank Vnesheconombank which has been under US sanctions since July 2014 The presidents son-in-law though his lawyer has said publicly he submitted the form prematurely and informed the FBI soon after that he would provide an update Vnesheconombank handles development for the state and in early 2015 a man purporting to be one of its New York-based employees was arrested and accused of being an unregistered spyThat man Evgeny Buryakov ultimately pleaded_guilty and was eventually deported He had been in contact with former Trump adviser Carter_Page though Page has said he shared only basic immaterial information and publicly available research documents with the Russian Page was the subject of a secret warrant last_year issued by the Foreign_Intelligence Surveillance Court based on suspicions he might have been acting as an agent of the Russian_government according to people_familiar with the matter Page has denied any wrongdoing and accused the government of violating his civil_rights Ellen_Nakashima and Ashley Parker contributed to this_reportThe facts as laid out in the newly unsealed plea_agreement between special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III and a former foreign_policy adviser to President Trumps campaign do not provide a slam-dunk case that the Trump team was colluding with the Russian_government But to a former CIA officer like me everything Papadopoulos admitted in the plea deal looks consistent with the modus operandi of the Russian intelligence services engaged in an active measures covert operation So what might the Russians have been up to with PapadopoulosSince late last_year when the US intelligence_community issued a on Russian involvement in the campaign it is clear that the Russian_government was intent on influencing the outcome of the election on Trumps behalf Trump had already stated policy positions that were much more favorable to Russia than Hillary_Clinton or the Obama_administrations stances he had questioned NATOs relevance played down Russias annexation of Crimea contemplated reviewing Western sanctions on Russia and so forth So helping Trump would be a reasonable Russian covert action goal Over the past months several elements of this wide-ranging operation have emerged such as the extensive use of propaganda from Russian-sponsored news media (for example RT and Sputnik) and the such as Facebook Google and Twitter in an attempt to influence US voters The Russian and the subsequent release of thousands of stolen emails has raised the specter of even more involved Russian cyber operations and it is still not entirely clear how far the Russians may have gotten into actual voting machines and voter registrations databases at the state levelAnd with Mondays news we now have greater clarity on yet_another part of the Russian operation how a Trump foreign_policy aide was lured into contact with Moscow The Papadopoulos indictment tells a story containing several elements consistent with how Russian intelligence (and in this case most_likely the Russian Foreign_Intelligence Service the SVR) operates According to the indictment Papadopoulos was living in London when an as-yet-unidentified professor there became interested in Papadopoulos after learning that he had a foreign_policy role in Trumps campaign Papadopoulos in turn became interested in the professors claimed Moscow contacts and the two apparently communicated substantially in pursuit of this mutual interest The use of a professor not a Russian_government official that would come later as first a spotter and later an intermediary to Moscow makes operational sense from the perspective of Russian intelligence Clearly Papadopoulos in his role as a foreign_policy adviser had access to information of interest to the Russians making an approach to him worthwhile As an added advantage he was outside the United_States further away from the prying eyes of the FBI Using a professor as a cutout to gain access to Papadopoulos would have increased the aides comfort level and minimized the chance of scaring him away from contact As it turned_out though the cutout wasnt necessary to gain the targets trust Papadopoulos wasnt worried at all about the prospect of meeting with Russian operativesNext the professor offered Papadopoulos concrete contacts in Moscow specifically with the Russian Ministry of Foreign_Affairs (MFA) as well as with an unidentified woman with senior contacts in the Kremlin This is consistent with the incremental approach to a relationship like this that Russian intelligence typically favors Having made Papadopoulos comfortable with a cutout in an overseas environment the Russians then tried to lay the groundwork for contact with actual members of the Russian_government Russian intelligence often uses the MFA as cover for its work which underscores the importance of the meeting Papadopoulos was offered with the ministry The official story for such a meeting would have plausible deniability another earmark of a good Russian operation The topic of any meetings between the Trump campaign and the MFA could simply be how to get a head-start on planning for improvement of the US-Russia relationship after the electionThe proposal of contact with the unidentified Russian woman who Papadopoulos later told investigators he initially thought was a niece of Putins was a further escalation of the operation The MFA is an official entity but this unidentified woman with nebulous but important contacts inside Moscow power structures is a bit more shadowy and covert in nature Meeting with an official Russian diplomatic entity has at_least the patina of normalcy candidates and aides do sometimes meet with foreign officials during campaigns Contrast that to meeting with a woman whose identity and position are not clear but who is promised to be of consequence in Moscow The scenario now starts to become sketchier But the Russians may have already assessed by then that Papadopoulos would be intrigued rather_than spooked Perhaps intelligence officials believed or hoped Papadopoulos was moving up in the Trump campaign given that he contacted more senior members of the campaign several_times offering to arrange the meetingsUp until early April_2016 the ostensible purpose of the contacts proposed by Papadopoulos was simply to establish an initial relationship with Russian officials to improve relations between the countries But by late April the Russians took the next step in the operation by offering dirt on Clinton dirt in the form of stolen emails even_though news of the DNC hack wouldnt become public for several more months If Russian intelligence officers were worried that taking this step brought increased risk which any intelligence professional would be trained to consider they neednt have been concerned Again Papadopoulos continued to advocate for Trump campaign officials to meet with the Russians well after hearing the offer of derogatory information on Clinton Indeed in June Papadopoulos indicated he would be happy to make an off the record trip to meet the Russians himself According to his plea_agreement Papadopouloss still-unidentified supervisor in the campaign replied I would encourage you (to) make the trip if it is feasible All that may not add up to legal proof But from a counterintelligence standpoint a sound case can be made that the identification and slow courting of Papadopoulos by the Russians initially using a professor with Russian_government contacts to arrange foreign_policy meetings then later morphing into a mechanism to share damaging_information on Clinton was part of Russias larger 2016 operation However like most good Russian operations this one built a strong element of deniability into the construct The Russian_government can easily say that it did have contact with some members of candidate Trumps foreign_policy team but only in support of future foreign_policy planning if their past statements are any guide they will label any other analysis as American Russophobia or Cold War-era thinking They will simply deny any claim that Russia was trying to pass Clinton dirt to the Trump campaignRussians will of course denounce all of this new information as conspiracy theories The Russian_government knows that Americans believe strongly in such Western values as hearing out all sides of an argument trying to be fair to all sides and telling the truth Russia takes great advantage of this and will inevitably try to sow doubt and cast aspersions We never interfere with the internal affairs of other countries least of all the United_States Russian officials will say More fabrication on the part of the US press unfairly targeting Russia state-owned media will crow Great umbrage and offense will be taken by Russian officials who will_continue to demand the respect that a great power deserves Americans should remember that all of that is also part of the Russians active measures operation against us and that there is probably more to comeMOSCOW When Russia faces uncomfortable accusations from abroad the Kremlin normally lashes back with official declarations andscornful comments on state televisionBut when the Democratic_National Committee and cybersecurity experts told The Washington_Post that Russian_government hackers had of opposition_research on presumptive GOPpresidential nomineeDonald Trumpofficials here met the accusations with little more_than a simple denial and a shrugUsually these kinds of leaks take_place not because hackers broke in but as any professional will tell_you because someone simply forgot the password or set the simple password 123456 German Klimenko Putins top Internet advisersaid in remarks carried by the RIA Novosti statenews agency Well its always simpler to explain this away as the intrigues of enemies rather_than ones own incompetenceI absolutely rule out the possibility that the government or government agencies were involved in this Dmitry Peskova spokesman forPresident Vladimir_Putin told journalists in a curt statement Western officials have accused Russia of conducting a campaign of high-profilehacking attacks that have included cyberattacks in 2007 against Estonia a 2014 assault on Ukraines power grid and a breach of the

Russian army officer said by telephone I dont_think that its something they willbe reallytalking much about or worried aboutMost state television channels through whichthe vast majority of Russians get their information did_not air reports on the allegationsSome of the few official comments posted online by Russian news agencies were dismissiveRussian officials have addressed the US elections sparingly Putin has offeredguarded praise forTrumpcalling him lively and talented duringa nationally televised news_conference in December But on the whole the Russian leaderhas stayed silent on the US presidential raceFyodor Lukyanov a well-connected political analyst in Moscow andthe editor of Russia in Global Affairs a foreign_policy journal said that there is great interest in the US elections amongRussian elites and that many see Trump aspotentiallya betterpartner for Russia than Hillary ClintonI dont see why they would be interested in doing this which would just electrify the

agencys scientific advisory_boards of researchers who get EPA grants arguing that the current structureraises questions about their independenceWhats most_important at the agency is to have scientific advisers that are objective independent-minded providing transparent recommendations Pruitt at the conservative Heritage_Foundation If we have individuals who are on those boards sometimes receiving money from the agency that to me causes questions on the independence and the veracity and the transparency of those recommendations that are coming our wayPruitt promised to fix that in a directive he plans to issue next week It remained unclear Tuesday what such a directive would sayThe EPA declined further commentThe administratorsremarks drew rapid criticism from scientific and environmental groups who called the move a veiled attempt to purge scientists from advisory_boards in favor of more industry representativesPruitts purge has a single goal get rid of scientists who tell us the facts about threats to our environment and healthJennifer Sass a senior scientist for theNatural Resources Defense Council said in a statement Theres a reason he wont apply the same limits to scientists funded by corporate polluters Now the only scientists on Pruitts good list will be those with funding from polluters supporting Trumps agenda to make America toxic againMichael Halpern deputy director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists wrote in a blog post that if Pruitt issues the kind of directive he promised he would be willfully setting himself up to fail at the job of protecting public_health and the environmentWhile experts from chemical oil and gas and other industries have traditionally served on these EPA boards industry groups have that it can be difficult for them to get adequate representationHalpern said industrymembership on the agencys Science Advisory Board is fine as long as individuals are evaluated for their scientific expertise and their ability to remain objective But he called Pruitts complaints about scientists who receive EPA grants a double standardSo lets recap According to some scientists who receive money from oil and chemical companies are perfectly qualified to provide the EPA with independent science advice while those who receive federal grants are not he wrote Its a fundamental misrepresentation of how conflicts of interest workThe EPA in recent months has solicited candidates for positions on its influential Science Advisory BoardThe panel had 47 members as of last_month before terms for 15 expired Alistof 132 possible candidates for board positions published by the agency included numerous people who have questioned mainstream research about the causes and severity of climate changeOne candidate has stated that more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will confer great benefits upon future inhabitants of the globe by drivingplant growth Another has faulted the climate_change debate saying scare tactics and junk science are used to secure lucrative government contracts Several others havechallengedthe EPAsown science on the warming of the planet in

Claire_McCaskill (@clairecmc) Thats certainly different fromher claims of no call or meeting with the Russian_ambassador ever over the course of 10 yearsThe senators spokesman John LaBombard argued there was a differencebetween the meetings Sessions met privately with Kislyak whereas McCaskills meeting was part of a group He also said that McCaskill called Kislyak rather_than the other way around She did attend a group meeting about adoptions with other senators and had a brief proactive call with the ambassador amid calls to several other parties to the Iran nuclear deal Lombardsaid()By contrast LaBombard said Attorney_General Sessions met one-on-one with the Russian_ambassador in the midst of a Russian cyber campaign against the US and then misled the Judiciary_Committee under_oath about that meeting He then tried to excuse it by saying it was part of the normal course of his Armed_Services Committee workOne of Sessions interactions with the ambassador was as part of a group in July at the Republican_National Convention after Sessions gave a speech at an event for about 50 ambassadors sponsored by the Heritage_Foundation Sessions then spoke individually to some of the ambassadors including KislyakThe second Sessions meeting is more sensitive but details are not clear It took_place in his Senate office on Sept 8 but its unknown whether aides were present It is also not knownif Kislyak or Sessions initiated the meeting A spokeswoman for Sessions characterized it as a meeting done as part of Sessionsswork on the Senate_Armed Services_Committee not as a Trump campaign surrogate She said that Sessions had more_than 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors in 2016In a statement issued Wednesday_night Sessions said that he never_met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign I have no idea what this allegation is about It is falseMcCaskill went too far to suggest that she had never_met or had a phone_call with the Russian_ambassador in the last 10years especially given that she had tweeted about such interactions in the past Certainly the circumstances of the Sessions-Kislyak meeting in September raise questions as do his answers under_oath during his confirmation_hearing but McCaskill undercuts her outrage by making such misleading statementsIf the full explanation doesnt fit in 140

of a former golf course in the southern area of SeongjuThe unnamed official said the assessment could take at_least a year or perhaps two noting that a similar evaluation for a THAAD_deployment in Guam had taken 23 months Yonhap reported But there was no hurry to get the system up and running given that North_Korea has been a threat to the South for years the official said[North Koreas]

examining the financial dealings of other Trump associates including former national_security adviser_Michael Flynn former campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort and Carter_Page who was listed as a foreign-policy adviser for the campaignThe Washington_Post previously reported that investigators were scrutinizing meetings that Kushner held with Russians in December first with Russian_ambassador Sergey_Kislyak and then with Sergey Gorkov the head of a state-owned Russian development bank At the time of that report it was not clear that the FBI was investigating Kushners business dealingsThe officials who described the financial focus of the investigation spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publiclyAt the December meeting with Kislyak between Trump officials and the Kremlin at a Russian diplomatic facility according to US officials who reviewed intelligence reports describing Kislyaks accountThe White_House has said that the subsequent meeting with the banker was a pre-inauguration diplomatic encounter unrelated to business matters The Russian bank which has been the subject of US sanctions following Russias annexation of Crimea has said the session was held for business reasons because of Kushners role as head of his familys real_estate company The meeting occurred as Kushners company was seeking financing for its troubled $18billion purchase of an office building on Fifth Avenue in New_York and it could raise questions about whether Kushners personal financial interests were colliding with his impending role as a public officialMuellers investigation is in a relatively early phase and it is unclear_whether criminal_charges will be brought when it is completeWe do not know what this report refers to Jamie Gorelick an attorney for Kushner said in an email It would be standard practice for the Special Counsel to examine financial records to look for anything related to Russia Mr Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about Russia-related matters He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiryKushner has agreed to discuss his Russian contacts with the Senate_Intelligence Committee which is conducting one of several investigations into Russian_meddling in the 2016 electionKushner rarely speaks publicly about his role in the

his leadership team at the FBI to discuss whether he should be prepared to assure the president-elect that the FBI was not investigating him personallyComey testified that not everyone on his team agreed he should Comey did_not name the dissenter but The_Post has learned it was FBI general counsel James A Baker Comey testified that the member of his leadership team said that although it was true at the moment that Trump was not under investigation it was possible that could changeHis concern was because were looking at the potential again thats the subject of the investigation

work Comey saidAnd so he was reluctant to make the statement that I made Comey saidBakers views did_not change even as Comey told Trump a second and third time that he was not being investigatedHis view was still that it could be misleading because the nature of the investigation was such that it might well touch obviously it would touch the campaign and the person at the head of the campaign

together The numbers on Clintons use of the plane never previously reported were provided by a spokeswoman for GiustraThe relationship has gained attention as Hillary_Rodham Clinton has launched her presidential campaign amid questions about whether the Clinton_Foundation has served as an avenue for wealthy interests to gain entree to a powerful familyGiustra 57 a Vancouver BC-based mogul whose eclectic business_interests include founding Lionsgate Entertainment and investing in gold mines and an olive oil company has come to symbolize a relatively new but substantial category of Clinton backers foreign donors who are not legally eligible to contribute to US political candidates but grew close to the Clintons through the charity In a rare interview Giustra told The Washington_Post recently that his friendship with Bill_Clinton has grown entirely out of their shared interest in philanthropy not businessI have one very specific reason I have a relationship with Bill_Clinton I admire what he does and I want to be part of it Giustra said But Ive never asked him for a damn thingBut Giustras donations and others from his friends in the international mining business are becoming a factor in Hillary_Clintons campaignLast week the Clinton_Foundation acknowledged that an affiliated Canadian charity founded in 2007 by Giustra kept its donors secret despite a 2008 ethics agreement with the Obama_administration promising to reveal the New York-based foundations donorsThe foundation said the arrangement conformed with Canadian law But it also opened a way for anonymous donors including foreign executives with business pending before the Hillary Clinton-led State_Department to direct money to the Clinton_Foundation For Giustra the partnership with Bill_Clinton provided an introduction to the world of international philanthropy at the highest_levels a feel-good reputation-enhancing effort that he said he finds more personally satisfying than amassing wealthAt the same_time Giustra continued to expand his business_empire closing some of the biggest deals of his career in the same countries where he traveled with ClintonIn one case he finalized a massive transaction to buy uranium mines in Kazakhstan days after dining with that nations president along with Clinton and about 50 other guests In another a Colombian oil operation he helped form received valuable drilling rights in deals involving a state-owned oil company that went through a few years after he met the Colombian president through the Clinton_Foundation Giustra said government approval was not required in either case Giustra and Bill_Clinton first met on June 5 2005 after Giustras plane touched down at the White Plains NY airport the closest airfield to the Clinton home in Chappaqua to pick up the former president and ferry him to Arkansas and then on to Mexico Colombia and BrazilThe airplane quickly became a core element of the new friendship between business mogul and political iconThe MD-87 aircraft is a full-size passenger jetliner with comfortable seating areas and a private bedroom The doors have gold-colored fixtures and an art collection hangs on the wallsMembers of Bill_Clintons inner_circle are constantly on the lookout for private aircraft to carry the ex-president and his team with the security and efficiency required by someone of his stature according to several people_familiar with the process Giustra said he and Clinton got along immediatelyClinton spotted the biography of Julius Caesar that Giustra was carrying He began talking_about the book quoting whole passages of it from memory Giustra recalledThat kind of broke the ice Giustra said Then he asked me about my background He asked me how I grew up So I started telling him my_life storyGiustra said the two related to each_other because of their similarly humble beginningsNo money he said referring to his childhood I_think we both worked very hard to achieve what we wanted to achieve I_think he kind of respected that and we hit it off right awayFrom that first four-day trip to a nine-day visit to Africa in 2006 to a three-day trip to Colombia last_summer the two_men came to know each_other wellAll the while Giustra kept an eye on businessHe finalized the Kazakhstan deal in September 2005 after joining Clinton in Almaty the former capital for the launch of a foundation health initiative endorsed by the countrys iron-fisted president Nursultan NazarbayevThe $500 million purchase of Kazakh uranium mines among the most productive in the world followed months of negotiations Giustra said insisting that it was finalized without any help from the Clintons Giustra had flown there days before Bill_Clintons arrival and the transaction received preliminary approval days after Clinton left provoking questions about whether Clinton had assisted The connection was in 2008 by the New_York TimesGiustra said Clinton had zero to do with the deal saying it was about to close anyway when the two_men met in AlmatyClinton has said that he was aware of Giustras pending purchase while in Kazakhstan but did_not discuss it or do anything to help its progressThat account is supported by a longtime Clinton aide Amed Khan who said that he was at Clintons side during every meeting with Kazakh officials and that a discussion of Giustras business never happenedGiustra said it was beyond ludicrous to suggest that Clinton engaged on the deal in part because the former president has very little interest in businessYou have to understand something about Bill_Clinton He doesnt care about that stuff Giustra said His eyes would glaze overFollowing the deal Giustras new company UrAsia was considered one of Canadas hottest new mining ventures The next year Giustra made a $327million donation to the Clinton FoundationIn 2007 Giustra sold UrAsia to a company called Uranium_One chaired by an old friend Ian Telfer Giustra who had retained stock in the company sold nearly all of his interests shortly_after that Still Giustra and Telfer are a focus of the soon-to-be-released book because of their role in the firm which several years later was sold to a Russian state-owned companyThe sale gave the Russians control of uranium deposits around the world including several mines in the United_States That sale was reviewed by the State_Department and other agencies at the time Hillary_Clinton was secretary of state Some Republicans have charged that this was a conflict of interest though aides to Clinton have said she did_not personally intervene in the approval process and showed no favoritism toward foundation donorsA few_weeks after returning from Kazakhstan in 2005 Giustra attended his first meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative in New YorkThere he was introduced to the leader of another country where he had business_interests lvaro Uribe of ColombiaGiustras interests in Colombia included gold mines port construction timber and more recently oil production Some of the companies he joined or formed have drawn protests from environmental human_rights and labor groups Giustra said he was not aware of complaints against the companies and has already sold his interest in most of themGiustra and Uribe were observed chatting with great intensity during a break between panel discussions at the 2005 meeting Since then all three men Uribe Clinton and Giustra have been in multiple meetings together in New_York Bogota and the Clinton family home in ChappaquaIn 2007 Giustra played a key role in forming a fast-growing oil company operating in Colombia Pacific Rubiales Energy It burst onto the scene that year by purchasing control of an oil production firm that worked closely with the Colombian state oil company which Uribe had recently privatized It also signed a pipeline deal with that firm and then won the right to explore for oil in environmentally sensitive areas along the Colombian coastAspects of Giustras ties to Colombia are discussed in Clinton Cash the book by conservative author Peter Schweizer due out this week and were by the International Business Times Some information from those accounts and additional details of Giustras activities were confirmed through independent reporting by The PostThe Colombia connections of the Clintons and their patron Giustra were evident in June 2010Bill Clinton and Giustra had flown in together on the businessmans jet while Hillary_Clinton had arrived for an official visit as secretary of state The three dined together in Bogota The next morning Bill_Clinton met privately with Uribe at the presidential houseA few hours later Hillary_Clinton held her own meeting with the Colombian leader In a subsequent televised interview she announced that she was inclined to support a much-sought-after free-trade deal with Colombia a reversal in position since her 2008 presidential campaignHillary Clinton was adhering to Obama_administration policy Her campaign press_secretary Brian_Fallon pointed out that then-Secretary Clintons statements in support of the deal reflected the Presidents positionNevertheless top Colombian leaders and their business allies were thrilled with the news that day from BogotaGiustra said the free-trade deal did_not come up during his dinner with the Clintons He said his relationship with Hillary_Clinton is cordial but not especially close We talk about my kids We talk about how lovely Vancouver is he saidOfficials with the Giustra partnership say it has funded thousands of cataract surgeries in Peru and provided meals for low-income children Recently Giustra said the effort has focused on helping people in Colombia and other developing countries find markets for goods they can make or grow at home resulting in permanent jobs for people in povertyBack home in Vancouver people who have worked with Giustra on charitable efforts describe him in near-saintly terms saying he is sincere when he says he became involved in the Clinton_Foundation to alleviate poverty around the worldAmong the local efforts he funds is an organization that provides mentoring for at-risk teenage boys in British Columbia It once helped put a former gang member through college on the condition that the boy meet with Giustra every few_weeks to provide updates on his progress said Jim Crescenzo a Vancouver teacher who helped found the programWhile Giustra had been involved in Canadian charitable efforts since the 1990s in his own telling it was meeting Bill_Clinton in 2005 that caused his interest to explodeHeres a guy whos an ex-president who could choose to do whatever play golf or whatever he said He works very hard and most of his work has to do with humanitarian workGiustra said he came to realize that wealth is temporary and that only through philanthropy can people make a mark on the worldI think any wealthy person has to think Do I really deserve to have this much money he saidA self-professed food fanatic Giustra has also launched his own olive oil company And he is the major investor behind the urban foodie magazine Modern Farmer which launched in 2013 and can be found at the checkout line at Whole FoodsThe second edition featured an_interview with a prominent subject former president Bill_Clinton Alice_Crites contributed to this reportHeres a timeline of what we know about

restore Russian-US relations based on the policies of the Trump Administration Putins announcement is made in the afternoon of Dec 30 or morning in the United StatesPresident-elect Trump tweets approvingly and pins the tweet at the top of his Twitter page The White_House insists that Trump had no prior knowledge of Flynns conversations about sanctions with KislyakGreat move on delay (by V Putin) I always knew he was very smart Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) The Washington_Posts David Ignatius that Flynn and Kislyak spoke around the time of sanctions announcement According to a senior US government official Flynn phoned Russian_Ambassador Sergey_Kislyak several_times on Dec 29 the day the Obama_administration announced the expulsion of 35 Russian officials as well as other measures in retaliation for the hacking What did Flynn say and did it undercut the US sanctionsIncoming White_House press_secretary Sean_Spicer in a conference call with reporters denies that sanctions were discussed The conversation between Flynn and Kislyak had centered on the logistics of a post-inauguration call between Trump and Putin That was it plain and simple Spicer saysVice President-elect Mike_Pence and Flynn have a conversation in which Pence says Flynn assured him that the conversations that took_place at that time were not in any way related to the new US sanctions against Russia or the expulsion of diplomats according to an account Pence later gave Fox_News SundayPence during an appearance on CBSs Face the Nation denies that sanctions were discussed Saying he had spoken about the issue with Flynn Pence says the incoming national_security adviser and Kislyak did_not discuss anything having to do with the United_States decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against RussiaPence adds General Flynn has been in touch with diplomatic leaders security leaders in some 30 countries Thats exactly what the incoming national_security adviser should do But what I can confirm having spoken to him about it is that those conversations that happened to occur around the time that the United_States took action to expel diplomats had nothing whatsoever to do with those sanctionsMeanwhile incoming White_House chief of staff_Reince Priebus on NBCs Meet the Press says I have talked to General Flynn None of that came up and the subject matter of sanctions or the actions taken by the Obama_administration did_not come up in the conversationTrump takes the oath of office and becomes presidentSpicer in his first official newsbriefing again is asked about Flynns communications with Kislyak Spicer says that he had talked to Flynn about the issue again last night There was just one call Spicer says adding that it covered four subjects a plane crash that claimed the lives of a Russian military choir Christmas greetings Russian-led talks over the Syrian civil_war and the logistics of setting_up a call between Putin and Trump Spicer insists that was the extent of the conversationFlynn is interviewed by the FBI about his conversations with KislyakActing Attorney_General Sally Yates accompanied by an aide goes to the White_House and tells White_House counsel Don McGahn that contrary to Flynns claims to White_House officials sanctions had been discussed in the calls based on the monitoring of the conversations by intelligence_agencies She also warns that Flynn is vulnerable to blackmailWe also told the White_House counsel that General Flynn had been interviewed by the FBI on February [] 24 Yates said in congressional testimony on May 8 Mr McGahn asked me how he did and I declined to give him an answer to that And we then walked through with Mr McGahn essentially why we were telling them about this and the first thing we did was to explain to Mr McGahn that the underlying conduct that General Flynn had engaged in was problematic in and of itself Secondly we told him we felt like the vice_president and others were entitled to know that the information that they were conveying to the American people wasnt trueThe president was immediately informed of the situation Spicer told_reporters on Feb 14 after Flynns departure The White_House counsel determined that Flynn would have broken no laws in his discussions Spicer adds The White_House has not disclosedthe length or depth of the counsels inquiry into that question except to say it was extensive and took daysMcGahn asks Yates to come to the White_House again to discuss the matter further Yates testified that he did_not indicate whether he had discussed the Flynn situation with anyone_else at the White_House He asked why the Justice_Department would be concerned whether one White_House official lied to another she said Logic would tell_you that you dont_want the national_security adviser to be in a position where the Russians have leverage_over him she saidMcGahn also asks to see the underlying evidence Yates says she would work with the FBI to assemble the material and McGahns review is scheduled for Jan 30Trump fires Yates allegedly over an unrelated matter her conclusion that Trumps executive_order barring travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries is unlawful The executive_order is later blocked by the courtsThe Washington_Post citing nine sources that Flynn had discussed sanctions in the phone_calls Flynn initially denied he had discussed sanctions in an_interview with The_Post but then amendedhis comment He indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions he couldnt be certain that the topic never came up not until The Posts report appeared did the vice_president learn that Flynn had given him false information about his contacts with Kislyak So according to the White_Houses account Trump had known of the Flynns false_statements for two_weeks but had not informed Pence Trump asked about the media reports about Flynn suggests it is news to him I dont_know about that I havent seen it What report is that I havent seen that Ill look into that Spicer later says Trump was saying he had not seen the specific report in The_Post not that he was unaware that Flynn had spoken toKislyak about sanctions The_Post that the White_House had known for weeks that Flynn had misled about the nature of the calls Flynn is forced to resign within hours after the article is posted Spicer on Feb 14 said Flynn was let go because he no_longer had the trust of the president and vice president()FORT BRAGGNC The military judge who will determine_whether Bowe Bergdahl goes to prison heard testimony Thursday from current troops and veterans who said the Army sergeants 2009 disappearance in Afghanistan led to severe injuries among those requiredto search for him lasting fallout that could become a factor in any sentence he receivesWitnesses described a missionduring the early morning of July 9 days after Bergdahl disappeared It called for US and Afghanpersonnel to fan out across remote villages in Paktikaprovinceto gather intelligence from local leaders about Bergdahlscaptors or possible locationThe team of six US troops and nearly 50 Afghans were attacked by machine gun and rocket propelled grenade fire leaving several seriously wounded including one soldier who was shot in the headIn the weeks that followed the massive search effort would involve thousands of troopsThese injuries are central to the prosecutions argument that by abandoning his post Bergdahl now 31 created greater danger for US troops deployed toeastern Afghanistan He was captured by the Taliban a short time later and ultimately spent five_years in captivity enduring brutal treatment that has left him permanently injured as wellThe Obama White_House secured his release in a controversial prisoner exchange in 2014Bergdahl pleaded_guilty to desertion and misbehavior_before the enemy with the latter charge carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonmentThe judge Army Col Jeffery R Nance also is expected to rule on a motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that President Trump who has referred to Bergdahl as a dirty rotten traitorto impartial proceedings Former infantrymanJonathan Marita told Nance that during their search for Bergdahl an unexploded rocket propelled grenade warhead struck his rifle nearlysevering his right thumb Pieces of the weapon were found several feet awayI thought I was

skull-and-crossbones belt buckle departedthe stand and shot an angry glance to the defenseMaritasleft hand his good hand was balled and tightenedBergdahls attorneys have pointed to phrases long uttered by US troops The enemy gets a vote and their own decisions affect what happens in combat And commanders whoexecutedmissions that were hastily planned or improperly resourced should shoulder some responsibility for missions that went bad they have arguedNational Guard Master SgtMark Allen wasshot in the head during the initial search effort multiple witnesses testified the most severe of theinjuriesto occur that dayEnemy forces were the direct cause of the horrific wounds to Allen said Army Maj Oren Gleich a defense lawyer Allen cannot walk speak or care for himself His wife Shannon is a caregiver and is expectedtotestify about her husbands condition Monday among the final witnesses before Nance determines Bergdahls fateGleich told the judge that he mightobject to potentialtestimonyfrom Shannon Allen that veersinto how shewas affected rather_than keeping focus on her husbandNance ruled in July thatAllen along with a would not have been harmed if not for Berghdals actions allowing their testimony to be used in Berghdals sentencingStaff Sgt Justin Walters a National Guardsman on the mission testified he saw the moment Allen was hitI watched just as a cloud of his blood came out the side of his head Walters said pausing as emotion overcame him on the stand while recallinghis efforts to treat AllenI was telling him to hang on The defense questioned Walters and others about training and lack of detailed preparation for troops on the mission underscoring the potential factors that could have played a role in the outcome Air_Force Lt Col John Marx led the mission as an intelligence_officer He was not trained in infantry tactics he testifiedThe prosecution played a video Marx took on the mission before the attack to highlight the relevance of Bergdahl to the mission But it also revealed the simmering resentment many troops felt about the exhaustive search to find himAll for a dude who decided to walk off Marx narrated in a short clip of the Afghan skyline Good timesJared Kushner as the senior White_House adviser who is under investigation in the Russia probe which is news that comes as little surprise Indeed when The Washington_Post reported last_week that many quickly assumed it was KushnerBut while those assumptions were based on his knowncontacts with Russians and his status as one of few senior White_House aides theres another reason his naming fits the puzzleHes related to TrumpKushners ability to even work in the White_House has been the because he is Trumps_son-in-law (Kushner has made concessions to try and avoid violating a federal anti-nepotism law including forgoing a paycheck) And a big reason anti-nepotism laws exist is to avoid the corruption that all too often comes with installing your relatives in positions of power As any expert on corrupt authoritarian regimes throughout history will tell_you those regimes wrongdoing will often run through family members with official titlesIt isnt clear whatpossible crimes might be under investigation and its important to emphasize that Kushner hasnt been charged with anything We dont_know where this will lead if anywhereBut heres a key part of In_addition to possible_coordination between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign to influence the 2016_presidential election investigators are also looking broadly into possible financial crimes but the people_familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak_publicly did_not specify who or what was being examinedIn other_words this isnt just about whether Kushner or anyone_else facilitated collusion with Russia during the 2016 campaign indeed the two meetings he had with Russians that have been spotlighted actually came in December Trump was elected Federal investigators appear to be cluing on some other potential crimes that may or may not be related to thatKushner met with Russian Ambassdor Sergey_Kislyak and then with Sergey Gorkov the head ofVnesheconombankwhich faced US sanctions after Russias annexation of Crimea Beyond that there arent many detailsIf it does lead down a path to corruption allegations though there will be plenty of I-told-you-sosYouve seen it in countries all over the world where theyve appointed family members whether its their son daughter in-laws it provides for tremendous opportunities for corruption Shruti Shah an international corruption expert at Coalition for Integrity People who want to curry favor find their way to provide favors to family members as a way to get closer to the person in powerAdded Gerald Feierstein a former top State_Department official and ambassador to Yemen in the Obama administrationFor many countries and governments certainly in the Gulf in the Middle_East they would recognize this pattern immediately I_think that they would find it completely normal that leaders mix personal business_interests with government affairs and would use family members in various official responsibilitiesKushner has already come under_scrutiny for his family possibly benefiting personallyfrom his proximity to his leader-of-the-free-world father-in-law His sister earlier_this month mentioned Kushners advisory role in the White_House Former Obama_administration ethics counsel Norman L Eisen was among those And heres what Eisen said when Kushners potential role in the Trump White_House first made newsThe problem with it is it sends a message that if you want to have influence in the administration do it through the kids And theres a tradition This is not the first time this has happened Im just shocked its happened in the United StatesIts possible that Kushners familial relationship with Trump is part of the reason hes been subjected to more scrutiny than any other White_House adviser in this probe And as emphasized above we have no idea what will come of thisBut if scrutiny of Kushner becomes more intense and there appears to be some validity to it it will reinforce a central reason whyethics experts say these kinds of arrangements are to be avoided in the first placeOn the face of it the Panama Papers dont look good for Russia Reporters investigating thehuge leak of financial datafrom a Panamanian legal firm havesuggested that up to $2 billionin offshore bank_accounts could be linked to a circle of friends closely associated with President_Vladimir Putin For many this information seems to corroborate what has long been rumored that Putin is corrupt on a huge scale After a few_days of silence the Russian presidenthimself has takenaim at the allegationssuggesting they were part of a broader US plot to But another very different theory is making the rounds in the Russia-watching world In short the theory says that Moscow isnt avictim of aPanama Papers plotInstead perhapsit is the Russians who are behind the leakOkay it sounds far-fetched but this particular ideais especially noteworthy because of who has advanced it Clifford Gaddy aneconomist who works withthe Brookings Institution Gaddy is one of the foremost Western experts on Russias economy and a former adviser to the Russian Finance Ministry in the 1990s Along with Fiona Hill of Brookings he is one of the co-authors of awell-regarded book on the personality of theRussian leader In a blog post published Thursday Gaddy outlined his thoughts on the matter You should read it all for yourself but Ill break down his idea into fourquick pointsIts a bold claim Gaddy admitted in an email Friday and one that heisnt totally sure of himself Its certainly not a theory hardly even a hypothesis Gaddy wrote adding that it wasmore a suggestion of something that ought to be seriously investigatedEven so this suggestion has caused a bit of a stir in the Russia-watching world Karen Dawisha an academic who also studies Russian corruption closely tweeted Friday that despite her respect for Gaddy his latest idea has failed to convince herIm convinced of everything else Gaddy writes but not this Americans arent n because US hasDelaware Karen Dawisha (@Dawisha) Others offered carefully worded praise Russian American journalist Masha Gessen called it excellent conspirology on Facebook while Brian Whitmore of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that Gaddy was trolling the KremlinThere are certainly of the idea that make a lot of sense For one it seems clear that the $2_billion stuff hasnt really hit Putin hard while some other worldleaders who have fraught relations with Russia -- for exampleand -- are being seriously rocked by their own links to the scandalWhy isnt Putin facing a domestic scandal Well part of it is simply thatPutin is an enormously popular figure in Russia and it would take a seriously enormous financialscandal to really knock him down Additionally many critics arealready surePutin is corrupt allegations of the Russian presidents wealth go as which would easily make him the richest man on earth and itshard to see how therelatively loose links_between Putin andthe $2_billion moved through Panama couldreally shift anyones thinking on the matterOf course there are other parts of the idea that dont fit together For one thing whilethe lack of US citizens has been widely noted there are in fact a few American links to the Panama Papers (See this article from ) Its also possible that more names could come out as more scrutiny is given to the vast amounts of data in the leak Or perhaps its justthat Americans prefer tax havens other than Panama (as US citizens are thought to favormore securehavens such as the Isle of Man the Cayman Islands and Switzerland)Gaddy himself acknowledges all of this However he also says that even if more and more information is found in the leaks hes still always going to wonder what might have been left outHow can we ever know if they are complete So far everyone seems only to be asking what secrets are in the Panama Papers he wrote We should also ask are there secrets [in Mossack Fonsecas original files] that are NOT in the Panama PapersPerhapsafter years of studying Russias information wars its only reasonable to be alittle conspiratorial Gaddy said hesseenhow Putin has used financial secrets to destroy or to control people within RussiaAnd now when he sees financial secrets creating huge problems for world leaders he has to wonder if Putin is back to his old tricks again)Looks like former president_Barack Obama and former first_lady Michelle Obama are putting down deeper roots in Washington After renting for their post-White House stint the couple have purchased the eight-bedroom nine-and-a-half-bath home for $81 million according to property recordsThe Obamas have said they plan to remain in DC while their younger daughter Sasha finishes high_school at Sidwell Friends After leaving the executive mansion in January the family settled into a rental home owned by Bill_Clinton press_secretary Joe Lockhart and his wife Giovanna Gray Lockhart an8200-square-foot home that was built in 1921 and renovated in 2011The Obamas still own a Georgian-style home in the Hyde Park neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago the city that will house the Obama presidential librarySpokesman Kevin Lewis in a statement said the purchase just made sense for the family Given that President and Mrs Obama will be in Washington for at_least another two and a half years it made sense for them to buy a home rather_than continuing to rent propertyDC records_show that Lockhart sold the home for $81 million to Homefront Holdings LLC which is controlled by the Obamas The deed transfer was recorded on Wednesday Lockhart bought the home in 2014 for $5295 million records showThe $81 million purchase price makes the Obamas new home the second-most expensive in the Kalorama neighborhood behind the $23 million that Jeffrey P Bezos the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington_Post paid for the former Textile MuseumThe Obamas have called the swanky Washington neighborhood (where neighbors include Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner) their home but its really functioned more like a home base for the globe-trotting family The former first couple for an extended vacation after leaving the White_House and alsoWriting for the New Republic in 2009 in a slightly different context Lawrence Lessig a problem for American politics that has metastasized over the past 12 monthsHis subject was transparency the sharing of information about what the government was doing at a massive scale We are not thinking critically enough about where and when transparency works and where and when it may lead to confusion or to worse he wrote And I fear that the inevitable success of this movement--if pursued alone without any sensitivity to the full complexity of the idea of perfect openness--will inspire not reform but disgust The naked transparency movement as I will call it here is not going to inspire change It will simply push any faith in our political system over the cliffWhat Lessig worried might happen if huge amounts of information were made public was that people would either intentionally or unintentionally cherry-pick information to suit their political rhetoric He used the example of people mis- or over-interpreting campaign contributions A $2700 contribution from an individual to a member of Congress is a drop in a very large bucket but rarely implies any real sense in which the politician is beholden to that person Nonetheless every election cycle sees a raft of critiques based on that relationship That was why faith in the system would be undercut he figured since public information could be cobbled together to make nearly any political pointLessig was writing only within the context of information produced by and about the government but its easy to see how the same concern ripples outward into the vast ocean of information that now exists online Its easy too to guess what prompts our revisiting Lessigs essay The release by BuzzFeed of a document full of unverified sensational allegations against president-elect Donald TrumpFor weeks (or perhaps months) news_outlets have been working to report on the claims made in the file (apparently compiled by a former intelligence officer) and to determine what the ramifications have been within the American intelligence_community BuzzFeed arguing that Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the president-elect dropped the file without context or clarification about what might or could be true (At least one of the more explosive allegations about a Trump lawyer meeting with Russians in Prague appears to have been )The document is full of a very particular type of information Wired who described it as human-based intelligence that is useful in raw form but requires a lot of sifting and validation How trustworthy is the source Has the source provided good information in the past Is this someone with real information or just someone who reads the news and wants to pass along fabricated storiesIn this case a former_British intelligence_officer told Wired the doc gives no_indication that the company has done work to rigorously separate the twoand consequently its really hard to tell whether any of the info is actually true or just a very exciting and expensively produced fan-fiction novelThere are clearly communities for whom that distinction is understood and not a reason to withhold the document from public view The president of ProPublica its publication in part because releasing it would accelerate discovery of what in [the] dossier is true and what [is] not -- as with that Prague meeting A member of Congress our Robert Costa that he was frustrated he only learned about the allegations after the BuzzFeed releaseBut both of those parties -- the media and elected officials -- have some desire and ability to parse whats true and untrue to apply the necessary caveats and evaluate what should and shouldnt be considered factual Looping back to Lessigs point not everyone doesThe Atlantics David Graham that dumping the document without validation is an abdication of what BuzzFeed as a media outlet is supposed to do Members of the press are provided with any number of rumors and allegations which they are then tasked with validating or debunking its rare when a rumor is published without that process having taken place In the rush to compete in a splintered media environment that process has often been curtailed which is probably part of the reason why public confidence in the media has dipped Report one-too-many incorrect or unverifiable rumors and trust in the rest of your reporting will declineThat doesnt_mean that individuals considering the details of the BuzzFeed documents are better equipped to evaluate them BuzzFeeds claim that Americans should make up their own minds about the rumors is patently ridiculous (as our ) simply because theres no realistic way for Americans to do so If CNN couldnt verify whether or not these events took_place how could a random person on the street Even assuming they wanted to the most salacious story from the document is currently trending on Twitter simply because its embarrassing to Trump not because anyone has any particular reason to believe itThe broader problem for the media though is that many Americans feel as though they evaluate information as ably as those whove spent decades immersed in the fieldYouve probably heard of the Dunning-Kruger effect Its the idea that you must have a certain amount of knowledge of a subject in order to know how little you know about it In other_words the more incompetent you are at something the less likely you are to be aware of that incompetence Weve seen a rash of amateur investigations of late often motivated by political reasoning that have had unwelcome results with Pizzagate at the top of the listPizzagate -- the nonsensical idea that Hillary_Clinton staffers were involved in a pedophilia ring operating in or near a DC pizza joint -- rose to national attention when a man entered the restaurant with a rifle to free children that the internet had convinced him were being enslaved there They werent and his investigation of the rumors demonstrated that to be the case The intel on this wasnt 100_percent the man later told a reporter which is actually totally wrong The intel 100_percent it just made clear that the thing he believed and hoped to be true -- that the conspiracy existed and that he could help curtail it -- wasnt accurate His self-investigation of the rumors gave him unwarranted confidence in his ability to evaluate the information presented though that information was the worst sort of cherry-picking bizarre assumptions made on emails weird assertions about iconography at restaurants and so on So much information was available about the pizza place and the Clintons that amateur sleuths could draw a line from there to child slavery if they wanted toThink of the shed in A Beautiful Mind where Russell Crowes John Nash picks out individual letters from news articles and connects them with thread in elaborate patterns Now imagine if he could post his results on the internet and build off of the threaded walls of thousands of other peopleWriting about that Pizzagate self-investigation Jonathan Mahler of the New_York Times that the distribution of information that defines the internet and allows it to get around roadblocks works for good and bad[S]omewhere along the way the democratization of the flow of information became the democratization of the flow of disinformation The distinction between fact and fiction was erased creating a sprawling universe of competing claims The internet cant route around censorship when the people who use it remain in their own closed information loops which is nothing more_than self-imposed censorshipThats what_happened here The media has long served as an imperfect gateway blocking bad information but thanks to the splintered media environment and social_media those walls have washed away The press was working to suss out what was and wasnt worth reporting from that dossier of claims but the internet routed around that holdup in the form of BuzzFeed There are some benefits to that That doesnt_mean it was good to doAt some point we need to figure out how to solve this problem how to better teach people to fairly evaluate information thats presented to them and to set aside as necessary their partisan inclination to believe the worst about their opponents Were still new at this everyone can access everything and draw their own conclusions thing clearly and for all of his frustrations today it has largely served to Trumps benefit The fake_news ecosystem in which to drive ad revenue is the most extreme version of the problemBut it is by no means the whole problemRussian President_Vladimir Putin and US presidential hopeful Donald Trump are kissing on the side of abarbecuerestaurant in Vilnius LithuaniaThe mural painted by local artist Mindaugas Bonanu was unveiledby the co-owner of theKeule Ruke Dominykas ekauskas on Thursday It has swiftly gained attention in both Lithuanian and international media A post shared by @keuleruke on A post shared by Made in Vilnius (@madeinvilnius) on The imageis a riff on the famous 1979 photograph that showed Soviet leaderLeonid Brezhnev and East German President Erich Honecker locked in an embraceThat the two_men kissing on the lips once a form of fraternal greeting between socialist leaders In 1990 painted an image inspired by the kiss onto the Berlin Wall where it became one of the most iconic works of art on what remained of the barrier between East and West BerlinSpeaking to the ekauskas suggested the new painting was inspired by the Soviet-era image We saw similarities between the two heroes (Trump and Putin) They both have an ego that is too big and it is funny that they get along well ekauskas said We are in a sort of a Cold War again and America may get a president who will want to be friends with RussiaPutin and Trump are known for exchanging mutual admiration statements with the Russian leader calling Trump a very colorful person tatented without any doubt and Trump saying it was a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond Their relationship however after Trumps campaign released a video that appeared to portray Russia as a geopolitical rivalLithuania and other Baltic states once dominated by Moscow during the Soviet-ere have repeatedly expressedconcern about In a statement sent to WorldViewsKeule Ruke said that the artists behind the mural were predicting that if Russia and the USA would ever make out it would happen in the Baltic states with tongues or with tanks1 On Friday of last_week WikiLeaks a number of emails from staffers at the Democratic_National Committee showing several instances in which employees of the supposedly impartial party organization disparaged or tried to work against the candidacy of Sen Bernie_Sanders (D-Vt) late in the 2016 primary season2 In part to distract attention from the politically damaging nature of the leaks Hillary_Clinton campaign_manager Robby Mook CNNs Jake Tapper that the emails had been stolen from the DNC by hackers working for the Russian_government and suggested that they were released to help Donald Trump3 Over the course of the week Trump has the assertion as Democrats have Trump to Russian President_Vladimir Putin4 Trumps opponents within his own party have tried to do the same thing On Monday George Will who has repeatedly spoken out against Trump Fox_News Bret Baier that he thought Trump was withholding his tax_returns because he is deeply involved in dealing with Russian oligarchs and others5 On Tuesday_evening Trump tweeted this in an effort to draw a clear line between himself and that specific suggestionFor the record I have ZERO investments in Russia Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) 6 On Wednesday morning CBSs Norah ODonnell Trump campaign_manager Paul_Manafort if Trump had financial relationships with any Russian oligarchs Manafort replied Thats what he said thats what I said Thats obviously what our position is7 The problem is that Donald Trump has in the past had obvious economic interests in Russia The Washington_Post them in June8 A quote in that piece from Trumps son Donald Trump Jr who is also an executive with Trumps business makes clear how the company in 2008 sought business from wealthy Russians In terms of high-end product influx into the US Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets he said at a conference that year according to We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia9 The year prior Trump said in a deposition that Russia is one of the hottest places in the world for investment and that he planned to be in Moscow at some point10 Donald Jr also described what it took to do business in the country Russia is just a different world he reportedly said Though the legal structure is in place for what we have today and even 99 percent is covered that 1 percent not covered could be 100_percent covered over there because it is a question of who knows who whose brother is paying off who etc11 Our article also delineated a number of other known Trump business links to Russia including12 Part of the problem for Trump is that he seems to be with PutinDo you think Putin will be going to The Miss_Universe Pageant in November in Moscow - if so will he become my new best friend Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) 13 As columnist Marcus Hawkins on Twitter Trump has backed away frompast assertions that he has a close relationship with Putin14 During a Republican debate in November Trump that I got to know him very well because we were both on 60 Minutes we were stablemates and we did very well that night15 In an_interview with a local station in Miami on Tuesday Trump his story as Hawkins notes I have nothing to do with Russia nothing to do I never_met Putin I have nothing to do with Russia whatsoever he said Asked if he had any outstanding loans from Russian banks or investors Trump replied Absolutely not Its ridiculous It was advantageous in November to seem close to Putin it is disadvantageous to be seen that way now16 Lets loop back to Trumps tweet about how he has ZERO investments in Russia He with for the record17 There are records that could prove his point as Chris Cillizza on Tuesday his tax records18 Trump has continually refused to release his tax records saying that its because some of them are being audited A former IRS commissioner we spoke with that this 1) wasnt prohibitive and that Trump could release the returns that are under_audit if he wanted to and 2) he could easily release the older ones that under_audit (Trump says he wont)19 Trump has used the lure of someday releasing his tax records as a way of deferring other questions In May he ABCs George Stephanopoulos that he would reveal how_much he paid in taxes only when he released his returns20 When Mitt Romney was under pressure to release his taxes in 2012 well note Trump about how he wouldnt hesitate to turn his own over I actually think that its a great thing when you can show that youve been successful and that youve made a lot of money that youve employed a lot of people he said I actually think that its a positive21 On CBS on Wednesday Manafort seemed to largely on the records ever being released Mr Trump has said that his taxes are under_audit and he will not be releasing them Manafort said22 The burden of proof is on those like Will who claim that Trump may have financial links to interests in Russia a burden that would be very hard to meet without the release of Trumps tax records or other documents detailing the income that Trump has reported23 From a political standpoint that works to Trumps disadvantage allowing his opponents to raise questions about something that can only be answered concretely by releasing documents hed like to keep private24 But Trump is pretty familiar_with that political tacticAn extremely credible source has called my office and told me that s birth certificate is a fraud Donald_J Trump (@realDonaldTrump)White House_press secretary_Sean Spicer made a point Monday to suggest that atop adviser to Donald Trumps presidential campaign wasnt really a top adviser at all Paul_Manafort who was the campaign_chairman for months was reduced to having But Manafort is hardly the only player the Trump team has downgraded retroactively and often in the face of strong evidence to the contrary This is part of a pattern and it stretches back to the campaignIn the same briefing Monday Spicer seemed to dismiss longtime informal Trump adviser Roger Stone and former foreign_policy adviserCarter Page as hangers-on Some of those names the greatest amount of interaction that theyve had is have cease-and-desist letters sent to them Spicer said Former national_security adviser_Michael T Flynn meanwhile was only a volunteer of the campaign Spicer saidThe common link between all four men of course is that they are now liabilities under_scrutiny for their interactions related to an investigation of Russian_meddling in the campaign But Spicers efforts to suggest that their roles didnt amount to much truly strain credulityThe Trump campaign did part ways with Stone in August 2015 and the two certainly have had an odd relationship But that relationship and Stone is widely still considered a Trump associate He on Monday that he still advises Trump in factI prefer to communicate with the president through short pithy memos as I have for 39 years he saidStone is now about his contacts with the hacker Guccifer 20 who has claimed responsibility for the hack at the Democratic_National CommitteePage was in March_2016 and as recently as August was described by Trump spokesman Hope Hicks as an informal adviser But after it was reported that his contacts with Russia were being investigated Trump campaign spokesman_Jason Miller insisted that Page and Kellyanne_Conway said he was Spicer said in January that Page was an individual who the president-elect does_not know and was put on notice months_ago by the campaign Trump said in February that Page In an_interview with CNNs Anderson Cooper earlier_this month Page declined to detail his work with the campaign but did confirm that he wrote policy papers for it And his experience on the campaign does span several months according to the Trump teams own words suggesting another liberal usage of a short period of timeFlynns role has been even clearer than Stones and Pages Although it could be claimed that they werent a major influence on the campaign even as its clear they involved Flynn was there in public with Trump at campaign rallies and was a top surrogate And then he later becameTrumps national_security adviser albeit briefly So calling him a volunteer for the campaign undersells thingsBut hes not even the only member of his family whose role has been strangely played down when he became a liability His son Michael_Flynn Jr became persona non grata after spreading the dubious conspiracy theory known as Pizzagate about Hillary_Clinton At the time Vice President-elect Mike_Pence said the younger Flynn has no involvement in the transition Miller would later clarify that Flynn Jr The younger Michael_Flynn was helping his father with some administration and scheduling duties early in the transition process and he is no_longer involved with transition effortsA similar thing happened with former campaign_manager Corey_Lewandowski After his run-in with a reporter and some missteps during the primaries aides assured reporters in April that he was basically reduced to the role ofYet the next month he was reportedly tasked with By June he was firedSo if you take at face value Spicers comments about Manaforts very limited role and the campaigns comments back then about Lewandowskis diminished role essentially nobody was running the campaign between April and June (In fact its widely believed that Manafort was the de facto campaign_manager during that time)And judging by how things are going right nowthe number of people who were truly involved in getting Trump elected may continue to trend toward zeroIn the June 1969 issue of Civil_War History Volume 5 Number 2 pages 116-132 a renowned Southern historian attacked the legacy of Confederate Gen Robert_E LeeNo single war figure stands in greater need of reevaluation than Lee wrote Thomas L Connelly the late University of South Carolina professor One ponders whether the South may not have fared better had it possessed no Robert_E LeeConnellys was among the first academic musket shotsfiredon Lees standing as an outmatched but not outwitted military genius presiding over a Lost Cause a reputation celebrated in fawning biographies and monuments like the ones removed earlier_this year in New Orleans Baltimore and other cities across the country Even the d the capital of the Confederacy is mulling what to do about its huge statue of Lee and other Confederate heroes on its iconic Monument Avenue But no where has the fight over Lees image been more contentious than Charlottesville where an August Unite the Right rally by white_supremacists neo-Nazis and Ku_Klux Klan members ended in The city is trying to remove its Robert_E Lee statueOn Monday nightWhite House_Chief of Staff_John F_Kelly waded into the debate over Lees legacy by calling him an honorable man and telling Fox_News host Laura Ingraham that the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil_War Kelly argued that Lee and other historical figures should not be judged by modern standardsI think we make a mistake though and as a society and certainly as as individuals when we take what is today accepted as right and wrong and go back 100 200 300 years or more and say what those you know what Christopher Columbus did was wrong he said You_know 500 years later its inconceivable to me that you would take what we think now and apply it back thenBut history is not set in bronze It evolves And though Lee remains an important powerful symbol in the South his reputation among scholars has evolved to the point that many either question or outright ridicule his stature as a battlefield savantTo Edward Bonekemper III the author of How Robert_E Lee Lost the Civil_War and several other books on the war Lee is not the humble proudbattlefield loser presented by documentarian Ken Burns and other popular works of history but a bumbling strategist and the central character in the most successful propaganda campaign in American historyHes talking_about the Lost Cause or as he titled a recent book The tenets of the Lost Cause are that slavery was already dying before the war that states_rights were really the issue anyway that the South did the best it could against a powerful killing machine (an early version of a participation trophy) and that Lees subordinates (especially James Longstreet) bungled the war most notably the Battle of GettysburgA big part of this myth is the adulation of Robert_E Lee Bonekemper said in an_interview He has gotten a lot of really good pressThat began Bonekemper and other historians have written shortly_after the war endedThe narratives of war are usually shaped by the winning side but after Lee surrendered the North got on with life and rebuilding the economy Meanwhile prominent Southerners set out on a spin offensive forming the Southern Historical Society which published hundreds of papers telling its side of the war and shaping its historyLee was elevated to the highest status possible Southern SaviorThe white light that falls directly upon him one booster wrote was from the smile of an approving and sustaining God One of his former officers wrote The Divinity in [Lees] bosom shone translucent through the man and his spirit rose up to the GodlikeOne cant do much better than that bosom and allIt would take decades of academic hand-to-hand combat to unravel the mythConnellys 1969 essay which among things criticized Lees obsession with defending his home state of Virginia at all costs was met almost immediately with scorn In the next issue of Civil_War History historian Albert Castel wrote that Connelly set out to do a job on Bobby LeeBut Connelly was not alone in his critique Other historians began piling onLee they wrote mishandled overall strategy of the war Outmanned Lee should have taken a more defensive posture drawing the North into difficult Southern terrain Instead he was constantly on the offensive which resulted in heavy casualties and broken spiritsAll the Confederacy needed was a stalemate which would confirm its existence as a separate country Bonekemper wrote The burden was on the North to defeat the Confederacy and compel the return of the eleven wayward states to the UnionHistorian James McPherson put it this way The South could win the war by not losing However the North could win only by winning The noted military scholar Russell Weigley compared Lee unfavorably to Napoleon in his landmark 1973 book Like Napoleon himself with his passion for the strategy of annihilation and the climactic decisive battle as its expression he destroyed in the end not the enemy armies but his own Weigley wroteLees ineptitude was most damaging at GettysburgOn the third day of battle in what became known as Picketts Charge Lee ordered his troops across an open field subjecting them to heavy fire Lee did this against the advice of his subordinates The rebels suffered more_than 6000 casualtiesLee apologists blamed Longstreets execution of the attack which many historians and military strategists now find laughableIn a 2006 the Center for Technology and National_Security Policy a Department of Defense research center called Lees effort at Gettysburg a blunder that doomed the hopes of the Confederate States of AmericaThe attack was poorly planned Lee continued even as the battlefield scene suggested he shouldnt information he either didnt seek out or ignoredRapid adaptive decision-making might have saved Lees army the briefing paper arguedThe ultimate lesson for the US military is that it is not enough to have battle-wise decision-makers they must be more battle-wise than their enemiesBonekemper has been speaking across the country including in the South about Lees faults and the Lost Cause myth for more_than 20 yearsEarly on he faced a lot of resistance to his conclusionsNow people dont get nearly as emotional as they used to he said They are more open to hearing that there is another side to the storyMonuments fall So do their legendskidnaps hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls to be used as sex slaves Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb guns down dozens of victims at Still other terrorists attack the just one week after the Islamic_State attacked Paris Africa has been suffering from still more terrorist shootings bombings and suicide attacks regularly How should the United_States respond to these increasing Islamist attacks in Africa The US command there has figured out a clever way to make a significant difference without overstepping its orders But as the problem of Islamist insurgencies continues the United_States will have to watch out for mission creepCurrently US military policy tilts back and forth between counterinsurgency and counterterror operations (or COIN and CT in military parlance)Counterterror operations aggressively target people who are violently attacking (or planning to attack) the United_States or its allies The goal Destroy our enemies or at_least make it much harder for them to attack our friends The United_States now has counterterrorism operations teams of Special Forces troops and armed drones underway in and The other major approach is Counterinsurgency tries to strengthen local social structures to so that local people stop supporting armed combatants Counterinsurgency does include limited direct combat or police actions against terrorists or insurgents to protect efforts to build a functioning local community But its real goal is to build a social and stable state thats less likely to deteriorate into terrorism usually through developing representative like constitutions and voting and local investment and building that will improve citizens lives However as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Middle_East Policy and insurgency expert Andrew Exum these two approaches are really a continuum rather_than opposing ideas Those working to defeat non-state violent actors can shift efforts across the spectrum building up a working government and functioning state or destroying terrorists and insurgents to find the proper balance on the way to the goal peace and stabilityStriking that balance is particularly difficult in Africa The United_States Africa Command known as AFRICOM controls all US military activity on the continent Most of the other regional combatant commands such as Pacific Command are almost purely military While it when it was founded in 2008 AFRICOM commanders also oversee efforts for the State_Department and the United_States Agency for International Development (USAID) in addition to running its skeletal military headquarters staffAFRICOM was conceived with a commitment to being Its mission is to coordinate diplomacy development and defense policies while keeping a small presence on the continent and avoiding direct combat missions These constraints are intended to reassure even_though the United_States had also remained cautious in Africa since its in 1993 As a result defense operations have been deemphasized in favor of diplomacy and civic development The military operations pursued have been largely focused on US allies militaries so that they could safeguard ongoing development effortsHeres the problem Since Muammar Qaddafi fell leaving Libya in violent turmoil and without a clear government violent Islamists have surged across the Sahara Desert into the weak states along the Saharas southern border a region called the Sahel Despite AFRICOMs multiyear efforts to build up partner militaries in Sahelian states such as Mali Niger Burkina Faso and Nigeria the militaries have been in fighting off this new wave of violent extremists And so AFRICOMs military-minded officers have started counterterror operations in West Africa The idea is that theUnited States could shift more efforts to bring down local threats like Boko Haram while continuing to help partner states like Mali and Nigeria strengthen their police and military efforts through training and armament programsBut while other combatant commands run counterterror operations by sending in with local governments AFRICOM cannot because it has neither the personnel nor the mandateThe solution Send in unarmed drones to help with surveillance while continuing to train and equip local allies like a and to The unarmed drones strike the right balance By sending them AFRICOM refrains from military adventuring as per its mission while helping its partners tremendously The militaries of Cameroon Chad Mali and Niger have found it challenging just to locate the violent extremist organizations threatening them The solve that problem enabling US allies to target their military forays effectively Not only do the surveillance drones help tremendously while staying within the mandates for a small footprint and for avoiding combat but Americans stay in control of the drones avoiding the (like a US-trained military officer launching a coup) that have been far too common Its a creative low-cost low-risk extension of the US militarys mission in AfricaOf course there are flaws Popular local figures have worried that even the smaller numbers of noncombatant US military personnel can And the effort shifts resources away from AFRICOMs primary goal building a functioning civil society across the continentThe most significant danger however is that these proliferating counterterror operations are increasingly undermining AFRICOMs basic principles which guide its overall strategyBecause the United_States has been reacting quickly bringing its counterterror operations where needed AFRICOMs counterterror efforts are expanding rapidly and with little outside notice or popular outcry This should be watched with extreme caution lest it become a major military commitmentBritish historians John Gallagher and Ronald Robinson assert and that its came from continuously reacting to local threats to its local interests and alliesSince this British experience is central to the first Scramble for Africa US mission creep may be a greater danger than anyone now recognizesImagine youre a college student Youre just minding your own business relaxing after a brutalweek of midtermswhen all of a sudden your friends startmessaging you Is this you one friend asks The message links to a viral tweetThis professor graded tests next to me the whole flight If theres a Taiwan_Jones at Howard boy you failed thef out ya midterm Your name is Taiwan_Jones You go to Howard CrapThis is the scenario that hundreds of thousands of people on Twitter wanted to believe was real on Thursday night as the original tweet about the grading professor and a worried reply from one Taiwan_Jones went viralBut we regret to inform you that this delightful anecdote about the power of social_media is not what it seems Many key parts of the tale do not add upPlease keep reading as we slowly and meticulously destroy the joy this story may have first brought to you when you thought it was totally real Its what we doA Howard University spokeswoman confirmed to The Washington_Post that the historically black college which is did_not have a student enrolled named Taiwan JonesThere are other colleges with Howard in their names so we are checking with them too Howard College a two-year school in Texas said it did_not have an enrolled student named Taiwan_Jones nor did Howard Community College in MarylandIts the one with nearly 150000 retweets seen aboveAfter digging around on the history of this account we can say with a great deal of certainty that until very recentlythis account tweeted underat least one completely different handle @SaucyIV_ That handle now shows up as inactive on TwitterThereare a couple of reasons we believe this is true but heres an easy way to see the link between the two handles If you look at some of the older still-live tweets from @JonesTaiwan_ they match thosewe found in a Google cache archive of @SaucyIV_s account from a few_weeks agoHeres an old tweet from SaucyIV_ from a Google cache ofthe accountAnd one from @JonesTaiwan_In other_words the Taiwan_Jones account that went super viral was very likely changed from a previous Twitter handle to match that of the student described in themidterm tweet Its a well known relatively easy trick that shows up again and again in dubious viral Twitter moments It also works pretty well as the hundreds of thousands of retweets on the Taiwan_Jones reply showWere not entirely sure but there are some clues Before SaucyIV_ became Taiwan_Jones SaucyIV_ s Twitter bio indicated thatthe tweeter was an aspiring Twitch streamer or someone who wants to make a living by streaming themselves playing video games online SaucyIV_ s Twitchbio is also named SaucyIV and on that page SaucyIV is described as a 16-year-old kid named Trent who lives in CanadaWe reached out toTrent via a Twitch message and a business email found on the YouTube channel linked to the Twitch bio but did_not immediately get a responseWhile were here lets addressa second Taiwan_Jones account on Twitter @TaiwanJones_ to the original tweet has more_than 13000 retweets Its also fake sorryIt appears to be the alternate account of another Twitter usersergi esteban troll journalist account until he changed it to try to go viral as Jones@Robinxvl also posted an image of a press request sent by BuzzFeed to the Taiwan_Jones account Friday morning which he bragged about turning down because of his hate for BuzzFeed When a Washington_Post journalist replied to those tweets asking if they amounted to confirmation thatthey were behind the Taiwan_Jones account @Robinxvl deleted themAt this point we reached out to Roy Handy the Atlanta-based photographer who sent the original tweet in which he claimed he had observed a professor grading student midterms on a planeHandy at first declined to chat about his tweet When we said we were having trouble verifying that a Taiwan_Jones existed at Howard University and that other parts of the story didnt add up Handy repliedI cannot verify what school the student attends which is why I said if in context of the tweetHecontinued I wasnt aware of how_much power this relatable topic could have across the HBCU community as a whole so Id rather leave the tweet to live in speculation of what could be or could not be fact or fiction Therefore again I cannot verify any information on this for a story to be made but I_hope you enjoyed itSpecial counsel_Robert S_Mueller III and his staff are investigating the potential role that then-candidate Donald Trumps presidential campaign had in the Russian_interference in the 2016 US election The scope of Muellers probe continues to widen and it now involves potential obstruction of justice by Trump and business_dealings involving Trump and his childrenTrump consistently calls allegations about Russian_interference a hoax witch_hunt and fake_news made up by his opponents His White_House continues to play down the allegations now deflecting to efforts by a Ukrainian American operativeto expose former Trump campaign_chairman Paul Manaforts ties to the Russian_government In response to questions about the Trump campaigns contacts with Russia the White_House says the real story of coordination is between the Clinton campaign and UkraineIndeed just hoursafter this column was published the president tweeted about the issue and urged a criminal investigationUkrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign quietly working to boost Clinton So where is the investigation AG Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) While there are broad similarities between the two there also are key distinctions that make this a facile comparisonLets briefly refresh our memory on what we know about Russian_interference in the US election (For more check out Fact_Checkers of events)In summer 2016 Democratic_National Committee officials and independent security experts announced that Russian_government hackers breached the DNCs computer network Hacked emails from DNC and other top Democratic operatives were released on WikiLeaks throughout the campaignLater US intelligence_agencies confirmed that the Russian_government directed the breach of US political organizations to help Trump win and hurt Hillary_Clinton The intelligence_community concluded that it was a top-down effort ordered by Russian President_Vladimir Putin to undermine faith in the US democratic processNow we also know that during the campaign Trumps son son-in-law and Manafort met with a Russian lawyer who hadties to the Kremlin with the expectation that the lawyer would provide incriminating information on Clinton as a part of the Russian governments efforts to help Trump and hurt Clinton (We have a on that too)Heres what we know about the Ukraine storyIn January that Ukrainian officials helped research connections between Manafort and Russia particularly Manaforts role in the rise of former Ukrainian president Viktor_Yanukovych A Ukrainian American Democratic operative named Alexandra Chalupa began looking into Manaforts ties to Yanukovych as a part of her volunteer work in 2014Politico reportedChalupa was hired as a consultant to the DNC during the 2016 campaign to help mobilize ethnic communities including Ukrainian Americans She left the DNC in July 2016 the DNC said She continued her research into Manafort on her own and she said she sometimes shared her findings with officials at the DNC and Clintons campaign Politico reported Former Clinton campaign officials information from ChalupaThe exact role of embassy officials is unclear Chalupa told Politico that officials at the Ukrainian Embassy were helpful in providing guidance to her questions and that the embassy also worked with reporters researching Trump Manafort and Russia A top embassy official denied working with reporters or with Chalupa on issues related to Trump or Manafort but a former embassy officer said he was instructed to help Chalupa on her researchDNC officials denied that they coordinated with Chalupa on opposition_research Chalupa was not a researcher for the DNC and the DNC did_not incorporate her findings about Manafort Politico reported DNC officials told Politico that the Democratic_Party had been looking into Trump and his ties to Russia long before Chalupa alerted themChalupa disputed the framing of the Politico story in During the 2016 US election I was a part time consultant for the DNC running an ethnic engagement program Chalupa said I was not an opposition researcher for the DNC and the DNC never asked me to go to the Ukrainian Embassy to collect informationWhat actually ended up hurting the Trump campaign was information released through an anti-corruption investigation by a Ukrainian government agency which released ledgers $127 million in cash payments from Yanukovychs party that were earmarked for ManafortSerhiy Leshchenko a Ukrainian lawmaker and former investigative journalist publicized these ledgers and criticized Manafort Ultimately reports about these payments led to Manafort stepping down from his position as Trump campaign chairmanIn a broad sense the stories appear similar Russia wanted to help Trump and at_least some Ukrainian officials were willing to assist in research that might have helped Clinton (The Ukrainian government insists it was neutral in the election)But when you dig into the details the comparison falls apart Of_course one fundamental difference is that Ukraine is considered a US ally and Russia is considered an adversaryA key distinction is that in the Russia case US intelligence officials found a top-down effort initiated by Putin to illegally hack and release information in a deliberate attempt to meddle in the US election and undermine the democratic system There is no such evidence of a top-down effort in the Ukrainian case Chalupa may have worked with some embassy officials but theres no_evidence that the DNC used information gathered by Chalupa or that the Ukrainians coordinated opposition_research with the DNCFurther the manner in which the damaging_information was obtained is different US intelligence_agencies found that Putin ordered the Russian hackers who breached US political organizations In contrast Chalupa researched Manfort on her own and without the direction of the DNC The ledgers were public documents that were released as a part of an anti-corruption investigation by the Ukrainian government not illegally obtainedSekulow says the Clinton campaign and Ukrainians shared information butthis is unsupported Clintons former campaign_manager Robby Mookthat foreign agents did_not reach out to the campaign about opposition_research There is no_evidence that the Clinton campaign had contacts with the Ukrainian government Meanwhile we have documented evidence that Trumps son son-in-law and former campaign_chairman met with a Russian lawyer in an attempt to receive opposition_research that they were told was from the Russian governmentThe White_House has been pushing this narrative to distract from the Trump campaigns willingness to work with a hostile foreign government to interfere in our election No one is buying it said DNC spokeswoman Adrienne WatsonThe White_House did notprovide an explanation of this comparison in response to our requestThe Trump camps role in the Russian_interference in the US election is still under investigation We dont have all the details about Ukrainian ties to Chalupa or the DNC either What we do know so_far is that there are key differences in the two situations and its clearly a facile comparison so_far We will not rate this comparison for now because there are too many missing details but we will update this fact check if new information emerges()In an Newt_Gingrich urged President Trump not to fireAttorney General_Jeff Sessions But having met with Trump personally the day before Gingrich provided a real window into Trumps justification for doing so Its all about the deep state and theyre paid killersGingrichs case boils down to the Justice_Department being an inherently corrupt left-leaning organization that left to its own devices will unfairly try to take Trump down Sessions was the guy who could have prevented that but he recused himselfThe presidents deeply troubled and I_think that hes legitimately troubled Gingrich said adding I_think that hes deeply troubled by the entire way that both [former FBI_director James] Comey and [special counsel Robert] Mueller have operated and the degree to which the attorney_general has not exercised any authority_over thatWhen the interviewer NPRs Rachel Martin noted that its not the attorney_generals job to protect the president Gingrich tellingly quibbled with the premiseNo thats not true It is the attorney_generals job to enforce the law Gingrich noted He added that there was not yet any evidence of a crime So what is Mueller investigating he said Muellers engaged in a fishing expeditionGingrich pointed repeatedly to a study showing and reports that basically all of the donations from Muellers law firmhave gone to Democrats He mentioned a former federal_prosecutor about alleged corruption in the departmentIf you believe the Justice_Department doesnt have a deep cultural bias and you believe that the average conversation at the Justice_Department is not anti-Trump youre living in a fantasyland Gingrich said And thats the presidents frustrationHe added In terms of the people Muellers hiring these are paid killersIf this is truly a reflection of what Trump believes that the special_counsel investigation is inherently out to crucify himand thatits mere existence assures that outcome then that explains why he would do just about anything to stop itThe alternate explanation of course is that Trump actually has something to hide and hell do whatever it takes to prevent Mueller from uncovering it up to and including trying to get rid of his own attorney_general as a means to also getting rid of Mueller Why be afraid of something if you didnt do anything wrong Martin asked Gingrich about thatYou look at that record you would assume automatically Muellers going to get somebody he said And theres no question in my mind Muellers bought in killers those killers are gonna go out and find somebodyWhether this is political cover for Trump or how Trump actually feels its a striking argument to make Its the very definition of a deep-state conspiracy theory in fact And its apparently at the root of whatever decision Trump will make next when it comes to SessionsLONDON The former_British intelligence_officer who had a key role in drafting the that alleged Russia holds compromising_material and information on President-elect Donald Trump has gone into hiding according to British reportsChristopher Steele a former MI6 officer and the director of a private-sector security firm in London was named as the author of the 35-page packet making the explosive and unsubstantiated claims According to British media reports Steele 52 fled his home in Runfold a village about 40 miles southwest of London on Wednesday morning before he was identified later in the day in a Wall_Street Journal reportBefore leaving his residence Steele called his next-door neighbor Mike Hopper and asked if he could look after his three cats Steele moved in about 18 months_ago with his wife and four kids his neighbor saidHe has asked me to do that sort of thing before so I didnt take it as anything different I was just about ready to go to work and he called me and asked me to come in gave me the key to the house He said that the family would be away for a while would I mind looking after the animals Hopper said in an_interview with The Washington PostSteele didnt say where he was going or when he would be back Hopper said that Steele a Cambridge University graduate was one of the more eminent Russia specialists for the Secret Intelligence Service better known as MI6 and had spent two years in Moscow in the 1990s The newspaper said he was a contemporary and friend of Alex Younger who now heads MI6 and at one point Steele was in charge of the services Russia deskDirector of National Intelligence James_R Clapper said Wednesday_night that US spy_agencies had not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable But US officials speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters have said that Steeles source network was viewed as credibleA summary of the document was attached to a classified report on Russian_interference in the presidential_election that was given to President Obama and Trump FBI_Director James_B Comey pulled Trump aside at the briefing with intelligence chiefs in New_York and told him about the attached summary according to a US official CNN first reported the exchange The president-elect described the allegations as all fake_news phony stuff and said it was a disgrace that that information would be let outSteeles London-based firm Orbis Business Intelligence was launched in 2009 by former_British intelligence professionals according to its website The private intelligence outfit is located in an upscale area in London not far from Buckingham Palace and has a global network of senior associatesWe provide strategic advice mount intelligence-gathering operations and conduct complex often cross-border investigations the firm says on its siteNeither Steele nor his fellow director Chris Burrows could be reached for commentWhile Steeles name was first published in the United_States the British media not usually known for restraint held off for several hoursIn Britain there is a long-standing tacit agreement between the government and media whereby the media receives a notice known officially as a Defense and Security Media Advisory Notice and agrees not to publish certain information relating to national_security The system has been in place for decades and is purely voluntaryThe British media received such a notice Wednesday_night just after 630 pm local timeIn view of media stories alleging that a former SIS officer was the source of the information which allegedly compromises President-elect Donald Trump would you and your journalists please seek my advice before making public that name wrote Air Vice-Marshal Andrew Vallance secretary of the Defense and Security Media Advisory Committee the body that issued the media noticeIrrespective of whether or not the stories are true the public disclosure of that name would put the personal security of that individual directly at risk he wroteBut after Steeles name started appearing in the US media it then became increasingly difficult to hold that line Vallance said in an interviewHe said his committee sent around another notice advising the British media to hold off until 10 pm thus allowing time for the former agent to make

may take weeks months or years theres no timetable for healingIn his spinoff series Game of Drones he simply recaps the entirety of the HBO hit show The plot of a recent episode is much more straightforward The episode starts with a trip to Trader Joes Then we make two Super Bowl sandwiches[]The presidents son son-in-law and former campaign_manager are expectedto testify July 26 before the Senate_Judiciary Committee about foreign influence on the US election in particular about their meeting with a Russian attorney with ties to the Kremlin who they believed would provide dirt on Hillary_Clinton during the 2016 campaignAlthough the president now praises his son for being transparent about the meeting Donald Trump Jrs statements about the ordeal shifted as more information was reported publicly And what we know so_far contradicts his earlier statements denying setting_up a meeting with a Russian national for campaign purposes (Moreover the White_House and Trumps team having contacts with Russian nationals)We compiled a timeline of what the public found out when about the meeting and what Trump Jr and Trump said about the developments We will update this timeline as necessaryIn an Jake Tapper asked Trump Jrabout then-Clinton campaign_manager Robby Mooks suggestion that Russians had hacked the Democratic_National Committee networkto help Trump and hurt Clinton Trump Jr called the claims liesNow we know that just one month before this interview Trump Jr set_up a meeting with a Russian attorneywhom he believed would offer dirt on Clinton involving very high level and sensitive information but ispart of Russia and its governments support for Mr TrumpIn an_interview with the New_York Times Trump Jr denied that he had participated in any meetings with Russians relating to the presidential campaignThis statement turned_out to be false that in June_2016 when his father was the presumptive GOP presidential_nominee Trump Jr arranged a meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin Paul_Manafort then the campaign_chairman and the presidents son-in-law_Jared Kushner also attended the Times reportedFor years Veselnitskaya worked to overturn the Magnitsky_Act a 2012 US law that blocks Russians who are suspected of human_rights abuses After former president_Barack Obama signed the Magnitsky_Act Russian President_Vladimir Putin responded by blocking adoptions of Russian children by US parentsTrump Jr confirmed that the meeting took_place which contradicts his March 2017 denial to the TimesIn his statement Trump Jr said the meeting was primarily about the adoption programTrump Jr was not forthcoming about the motivations behind this meeting which we would find out the next_day that Trump Jr was in fact promised damaging_information about Clintonbefore arranging the meeting with Veselnitskaya It was unclear_whether the attorney actually produced damaging_information about Clinton at the meeting but the expectation was that she would the Times reportedTrump Jrs response then shifted acknowledging that he had met with her for campaign information but that the meeting turned_out to be about adoptionsMeanwhile President Trump tweeted two days after his meeting with Putin at the G-20 summit that Putin had denied Russian_meddling in the 2016 electionsI strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian_meddling in our election He vehemently denied it Ive already given my opinion Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) On Fox_News Sunday White_House Chief of Staff Reince_Priebus called the Trump Jr meeting a big nothing burger that was about adoptions the existence of an email_exchange with Trump Jr and Rob Goldstone the intermediary who helped broker the meeting with Veselnitskaya Goldstone is a music publicist who represented Emin_Agalarov whose father is a major real_estate developer close to Putin and who worked with Trump in 2013 to bring the Miss_Universe pageant to MoscowSources who described the emails said Trump Jr was promised potentially damaging_information on Clinton via the Russian governmentTrump Jrs lawyer said in a statement that this is much ado about nothing The attorney Alan Futerfas acknowledged this meeting was set_up with the expectation that Trump Jr would receive information on ClintonTrump Jr tweeted sarcastically about opposition_research Again this contradicts his March 2017 claim to the Times that he had not set_up any meetings with Russians about campaign-related issuesObviously Im the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent went nowhere but had to listen Donald Trump Jr (@DonaldJTrumpJr) No inconsistency in statements meeting ended up being primarily about adoptions In response to further Qs I simply provided more details Donald Trump Jr (@DonaldJTrumpJr) The Times obtained the email_exchange Moments before the Times story posted Trump Jr released the emails on Twitter claiming he did so to be totally transparentRemember why published the emails Because the did_not stop working to inform the public Adam Goldman (@adamgoldmanNYT) confirmed the Timess reporting From the outset Trump Jr set_up the meeting to receive confidential and potentially damaging_information on Clinton provided through the Russian governmentIf its what you say I love it especially later in the summer Trump Jr wrote to Goldstone referring to when his father officially would be the GOP candidateLater that day Trump Jr told Fox Newss Sean Hannity that he left the meeting feeling annoyed because the attorney wanted to talk about adoptions rather_than giving incriminating information on ClintonThe email chain contradicted several previous Trump Jr statementsOver the next several days it was revealed that there were attending the meeting including a Russian-American lobbyist and a man who into foreign money-laundering operations using US banksTrumps lawyerrepeatedly saidthat Trump was not involved in draftingand did_not sign off on his sons original statement on July 8 in response to the Times reporting This would On July 12 Trump commented publicly for the first time about his sons meetingTrump and his son continue to characterize this as an ordinary move by campaigns conducting opposition researchMy son Donald did a good job last night He was open transparent and innocent This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history Sad Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don jr attended in order to get info on an opponent Thats politics Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) But this is misleading and yet_another attempt to spin the truthVeterans of previous presidential campaigns from both parties said it would be very odd and highly unusual to accept opposition_research from foreign officials For_example ahead of a presidential debate during the 2000 campaign then-Vice President Al Gores adviser Tom Downey with information that was stolen from the George_W Bush campaign Downey who was helping Gore with debate preparation at the time turned the material over to the FBI Heto avoid the perception of improper advantage and the campaign about what_happened along with a detailed timelineFrom the chief_strategist of Mitt Romneys 2012 presidential campaignIf you can find someone in other presidential campaigns who has received oppo from foreign interests please share stuart stevens (@stuartpstevens) Gary Maloney a longtime GOP opposition researcher I do not fault Donald Jr for wanting to win He seeks more data more leads nothing wrong there But where was the campaign team The managers job is to protect the candidate and family from blowback I worked in Bush 88 would [campaign manager] Lee Atwater have allowed George_W at such a sitdown Inconceivable Would John_Podesta have allowed Chelsea Clinton in this meeting Impossible()Manafort helps Republican presidential_nominee Gerald R Fords efforts at

news articles raising questions about his ties to Russia and UkraineTrump is elected presidentFor years Ed_Gillespie has pushed for the Republican_Party to expand its appeal to voters of color to survive in a changing countryAs head of the Republican_National Committee in 2004 he oversaw a $10million initiative to reach out to Hispanics while also trying to make inroads with black and Asian voters He has championed a pathway to legal status for undocumented_immigrants And he said the GOPs Virginia gubernatorial nominee in 2005 Jerry W Kilgore lost the election because he alienated Latino voters with an Now Gillespie is running for governor and his commitment to a big-tent party is being tested in President Trumps AmericaIn the campaigns final stretch Gillespies paid advertising has focused heavily on the an issue he has tried to tie to his Democratic_opponent Lt Gov Ralph_Northam He also has vowed to preserve the states Confederate_monuments and he attacked Democrats for and who are disproportionately blackThe victory of Trump who campaigned on a hard-line immigration platform and repeatedly disparaged minorities upended conventional GOP thinking about the value of a big-tent approach A Gillespie victory in a diversifying Virginia where a Republican hasnt won statewide since 2009 would cement the value of running hard to the right on cultural issues political observers and strategists sayI think [Gillespie has] realized that the big tent is slowly becoming a yurt said Jennifer Duffy who tracks gubernatorial races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report We are going to see a lot more of this in 2018 especially in primariesGillespie resists suggestions that his tone on issues affecting minority voters has changed He says he lives up to his for ALL Virginians campaign slogan mingling with voters at mosques ethnic food festivals and black-owned barber shops He has also tapped high-profile Latino surrogates to campaign with him SenMarco Rubio (R-Fla) and New Mexico Gov Susana Martinez (R)I take my campaign to every corner of the commonwealth he said in a recent interviewOn the trail Gillespie is more comfortable talking_about tax_cuts and jump-starting the economy than race And when he does approach the explosive issue he strikes a measured toneVictims of MS-13_gang violence he notes are often immigrants He says Confederate_monuments should have historical context to ensure they dont And he acknowledges racial disparities in the criminal justice systemBut his campaign commercials and mailers on the same issues which experts say reach a larger audience strike a harsher tone His personal style is the big-tent Republican in him said Bob Holsworth a veteran observer of Virginia politics But the campaign has a strong dose of TrumpismRace took center stage in Virginias elections after white_nationalists descended into Charlottesville to support a Confederate monument sparking violence that left many injured and one woman dead Gillespie repeatedly denounced the group but recent Democratic links Gillespie to the white_supremacists because he never explicitly condemned Trump for saying there were very fine people on both_sides While Gillespie says his MS-13 ads are about public safety Democrats and immigration advocates blast the commercials which include images of tattooed Latino men and the gang slogan Kill Rape Control as stoking fears of minority criminals and They may even have gotten Trumps attention He that echoed the false claims in the MS-13 ads against Northam Earlier this week Trump followed up with a set of tweets that said Gillespie would protect And they were certainly noticed by former president_Barack Obama who delivered a scathing attack on the ads during a rally last_week for Northam in Richmond Virginia Del Jason S Miyares (R-Virginia Beach) dismissed fellow Latinos who are critical of the ads I dont_think they give enough credit to voters of Virginia that this is about criminal gangs this isnt about Latinos he saidGillespie recently brushed off criticism when callers to a radio show challenged the ads Its others conflating MS-13 and the immigrant community not me he said Im making a very clear distinctionMike Madrid a GOP strategist says such ads are effective with some voters but also alienate Latinos the fastest-growing segment of the US electorate Most polls have shown Gillespie either tied with or narrowly trailing Northam When you are behind you have to shoot every arrow in your quiver said Madrid an expert on the behavior of Latino voters But you are creating generational problems to win short-term election cycles and thats the California storyIn California Gov Pete Wilson a moderate Republican who once backed immigration reform campaigned for reelection in 1994 on a platform of denying state benefits to immigrants living in the state illegallyWilson handily won But it was seen as a Pyrrhic victory that electrified Latino voters and permanently tarnished the GOP brand in a state that is now solidly blueGillespie invoked Wilson in a 2006 warning to Republicans against messaging that can be perceived as anti-LatinoAnti-immigration rhetoric is a political siren song and Republicans must resist its lure by lashing ourselves to our partys twin masts of freedom and growth or our majority will crash on the shoals Gillespie wrote in an opinion piece for the Wall_Street JournalHe credited Republican Robert F McDonnells victory in Virginias 2009 gubernatorial election to engaging Hispanic voters who make up about of the electorate instead of indulging in the anti-immigration rhetoric of past Republican campaignsFrank Sharry executive director of the pro-immigration group Americas Voice said he was shocked to see Gillespies evolutionMr Gillespie is putting his relatively good reputation on the line in a way that will tarnish him forever Sharry said In recent_years the Republican_Party has gone through a tumultuous journey on immigration issues creating a tightrope for candidates President George_W Bushs attempt at comprehensive immigration reform including a path to legal status failed in 2007 the same week Gillespie became a White_House counselor Gillespie also advised 2012 presidential contender Mitt Romney whose loss resulted in an autopsy that urged the party to embrace comprehensive immigration reformBut calls for more moderate positions receded as primary voters and activists demanded a tougher stance on immigration They flexed their muscles in Virginia in 2014 when voters in the Richmond suburbs then the House majority leader In the 2016 GOP presidential primaries past support for an overhaul became liabilities for former Florida governor Jeb Bush and RubioGillespie almost became a victim himself when he the Republican primary in June to Corey A Stewart a Trump acolyte who made defending Virginias Confederate statues his signature cause and promised to crack down on illegal immigrantsBy September Gillespie was adopting some of the same tactics for the general electionIf Gillespie wins Republicans competing in the 2018 midterms will embrace his approach to racial issues said Tom Steyer a Democratic megadonor who has spent at_least $3 million to elect Democrats in Virginia this yearMr Gillespie has descended to a very low_level of division and racialization and if it works I_think Republicans across the country are going to draw the conclusion that thats where they have to go Steyer saidIn New_Jersey which is holding the nations only other gubernatorial contest this year the Republican candidate is airing a who allegedly raped a child and shot four young people and accuses the Democratic candidate of wanting to make the state a sanctuary for illegal immigrantsRepublicans this year have homed in on criticism of sanctuary_cities a loosely defined term that generally refers to jurisdictions that see immigration enforcement as a strictly federal responsibility and do not alert federal officials about someone who might be in the country illegally They also will not hold suspected undocumented_immigrants after they have completed a jail sentence for them to be picked_up by federal authorities Gillespies ads accuse Northam of casting a deciding vote against a ban on sanctuary_cities But Virginia does_not have sanctuary_cities and Northam did_not cast a deciding vote because the bill eventually passed the legislature and was vetoed by Gov Terry McAuliffe (D)Gillespies sanctuary_cities ads are not only targeted at ruby-red rural districts where he needs to turn out his base but also geared toward moderate voters in purple Washington exurbs that are crucial for statewide victoryKilgore currently finance chair of the state GOP says the immigration ads he aired in 2005 are not comparable to Gillespies advertising blitzEd has actually found a public safety issue that resonates not just with the immigrant community but with soccer moms and others in Northern_Virginia Kilgore saidGillespie and his surrogates frequently highlight eight recent killings in Northern_Virginia that authorities believe are related to MS-13 And the candidate often mentions that he hears concerns about the gang from voters in Northern_Virginia including from an unidentified Hispanic faith leader At a recent town hall in Leesburg in the swing Washington exurb of Loudoun County Gillespie ended his speech by talking_about the threat of MS-13_gang violence stressing that he joined local law_enforcement for a ride-along and that he would work with Rep Barbara Comstock a Republican who represents the area in Congress to increase funding for a regional gang task forceAmong the attendees was Celia Meyer a 27-year-old new mother who lives in nearby Ashburn She prefers not to discuss Trump and says Gillespies call to reduce taxes is enough to win her vote But she also said his criticism of sanctuary_cities hits upon valid concernsTheres nothing wrong with trying to make our_country safer especially when people arent supposed to be here in the first place Meyer saidOthers resent the idea that Gillespies criticism of sanctuary_cities amounts to a hard-right immigration stanceCalling him racist at every turn is stupid and saying You dont_want violent gangs means You hate immigrants is stupid said Theseus Schulze a 23-year-old law student who voted for Libertarian Gary Johnson in November Him saying no sanctuary_cities is a totally moderate position that most people support but Democrats go crazy and call him racistA top executive from Donald Trumps real_estate company emailed Russian President_Vladimir Putins personal spokesman during the US presidential campaign last_year to ask for help advancing according to documents submitted to Congress on MondayThe request came in a mid-January 2016 email from Michael_Cohen one of Trumps closest business advisers who asked longtime Putin lieutenant Dmitry_Peskov for assistance in reviving a deal that Cohen suggested was languishingOver the past few months I have been working with a company based in Russia regarding the development of a Trump Tower-Moscow project in Moscow City Cohen wrote to Peskov according to a person_familiar with the email Without getting into lengthy specifics the communication between our two sides has stalledAs this project is too important I am hereby requesting your assistance I respectfully request someone preferably you contact me so that I might discuss the specifics as well as arranging meetings with the appropriate individuals I thank you in advance for your assistance and look_forward to hearing from you soon Cohen wroteCohens email marks the most direct outreach documented by a top Trump aide to a similarly senior member of Putins governmentCohen told congressional_investigators in a statement Monday that he did_not recall receiving a response from Peskov or having further contact with Russian_government officials about the project The email addressed to Peskov appeared to have been sent to a general Kremlin press accountThe note adds to the list of contacts_between Trump associates and Russian officials that have been a focus of multiple congressional inquiries as well as an investigation led by special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III exploring Russian_interference in the 2016 election US intelligence_agencies have concluded that the Kremlin intervened to help elect TrumpCohens email to Peskov provides an example of a Trump business official directly seeking Kremlin assistance in advancing Trumps business interestsCohen told congressional_investigators that the deal was envisioned as a licensing project in which Trump would have been paid for the use of his name by a Moscow-based developer called IC Expert Investment Co Cohen said that he discussed the deal three_times with Trump and that Trump signed a letter of intent with the company on Oct_28 2015 He said the Trump company began to solicit designs from architects and discuss financingHowever he said that the project was abandoned for business reasons when government permission was not secured and that the matter was not related in any way to Mr Trumps presidential campaignCohens request to Peskov came as Trump was distinguishing himself on the campaign_trail with his warm rhetoric about PutinCohen said in his statement to Congress that he wrote the email at the recommendation of who was serving as a broker on the dealIn the statement obtained by The Washington_Post Cohen said Sater suggested the outreach because a massive Trump development in Moscow would require Russian_government approval White_House special_counsel Ty Cobb said Trump knew nothing about Cohens effort to enlist Peskovs helpThe mere fact that there was no apparent response suggests this is a non-collusion story he said Cohen has been one of Trumps closest aides since 2007 serving as a business emissary lawyer and sometimes spokesman for Trump Friends said Trump has treated Cohen like a member of his family Cohen who was executive vice_president of the Trump_Organization did_not have a formal role in Trumps campaign But he spoke with reporters as a defender of Trump and appeared on television as a surrogate for the candidate He left the company shortly_before Trump was inaugurated as president and since January has served as one of Trumps personal lawyersIn a statement to The_Post Cohen described the potential Moscow project as simply one of many development opportunities that the Trump_Organization considered and ultimately rejectedIt should come as no surprise that over four decades the Trump_Organization has received and reviewed countless real_estate development opportunities both domestic and international he added Cohen said he abandoned the project because he lost confidence that the Moscow developer would be able to obtain land financing and government approvals It was a building proposal that did_not succeed and nothing more he saidThe Post_reported Sunday that Cohen had been in negotiations with Sater and foreign investors to build a Trump_Tower in the Russian capital from September 2015 through the end of January 2016 at the same_time Trump was campaigning for president Trump entered the race in June 2015 and by January 2016 he was leading in the polls for the Republican nominationCohen told congressional_investigators that Sater constantly pushed him to travel to Moscow as part of the negotiations but that he declined to do soHe said that Sater who has attempted to broker Trump deals for more_than a decade was prone to salesmanship and that as a result he did_not routinely apprise others in the company about their interactions and never considered asking Trump to go to Moscow as Sater had requestedSater said in a statement Monday that he brought the idea of the largest tower in Russia to Cohen his longtime friend Despite Saters enthusiasm for the plan he said the Trump_Organization abandoned it Michael_Cohen was the only member of the Trump_Organization who I communicated with on this project Sater saidOver email Sater bragged to Cohen that he could get Putin to assist with the project and that it would help Trumps presidential campaign according to correspondence submitted to congressional investigatorsOur boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it Sater wrote in a November 2015 email I will get all of Putins team to buy in on this I will manage this processThe Post on Sunday first reported on the existence of the emails copies of which were published Monday by the New_York TimesIn another email published by the Times and confirmed by The_Post Sater described accompanying Trumps daughter_Ivanka Trump on a 2006 trip to Moscow I arranged for Ivanka to sit in Putins private chair at his desk and office in the Kremlin Sater wroteIvanka Trump said she had taken a brief tour of the Kremlin but did_not recall sitting in Putins chairShe added I was not part of Michael Cohens discussions surrounding a potential Trump project that he was evaluating in 2015 in Russia with the exception of recommending architects to consider as part of the routine design process for any potential dealDonald Trump has tried to distance himself from Sater a New_York developer whose office was located in Trump_Tower and who helped broker licensed Trump deals Sater had served time in jail in the 1990s after a bar fight and pleaded_guilty in 1998 to his role in Mafia-linked stock fraud Federal officials have said he then cooperated on various national_security and criminal investigations In writing to Peskov Cohen was reaching_out to a Kremlin official considered one of the main gatekeepers to PutinPeskov was appointed the head of the presidential press service in 2000 during Putins first term and has served as a spokesman for Putin in various roles since staying with Putin during his four years as prime_minister Because he regularly travels with and speaks to Putin he is a target for lobbyists and petitioners trying to attract the Russian presidents attention Aside from being the Kremlins mouthpiece hes definitely someone who is viewed as a senior lieutenant an important oligarch in Putins power system said Steven L Hall who retired from the CIA in 2015 after 30_years of managing the agencys Russia operations If youre looking for someone who is close to Putin Dmitry_Peskov is as good as any of them Asked for comment about the Trump_Tower negotiations Amanda Miller a spokeswoman for the Trump_Organization emphasized Monday that Cohen did_not pursue the deal beyond its initial stages After the signing of a non-binding letter of intent it was not significantly advanced (ie there was no site no financing and no development) she wrote in an email to The_Post To be clear the Trump_Organization has never had any real_estate holdings or interests in RussiaStill Trump repeatedly tried for three decades to build in Russia In 2013 he signed a preliminary agreement to build a tower in partnership with Aras_Agalarov a billionaire who had financed the Trump-owned Miss_Universe pageant when it was held in Moscow in 2013 Agalarov told The_Post last_year that his companys deal with Trump was on hold because of the presidential campaignA representative of Agalarovs company attended a June_2016 meeting with top Trump aides and a Russian lawyer organized by Donald Trump Jr after he was told that the lawyer would provide damaging_information about Democratic rival Hillary_Clinton provided by the Russian_government Scott Balber an attorney for Agalarov said Agalarov and his company played no role in the 2015-16 Trump_Tower proposal Andrew Roth in Moscow contributed to this reportWhen a White_House is confronted with a negative news story officials face a difficult challenge if the story is largely correct A common PR technique is to deny things that are not in the story or to make sweeping declarations while ignoring the specificsThe Trump White_House is playing this game in its response to several key points fromAs a guide to readers The Fact_Checker will translate the comments made by national_security adviser HR McMaster both on Monday evening and Tuesday morning in response to the Post reportThe key phrase is as reported With this language McMaster in theory could dispute anyelement no matter how small as false He notably did_not say the story was falseThis is confirmation that the laptop discussion took placeThe Post story did_not say intelligence sources or methods were discussed or that Trump discussed undisclosed military operations So this is classic deflection from the key findings of the report the PR version of three-card monteNow McMastersays the premise of the article is false In other_words it made the president look bad not that it was wrongMcMaster ducks a question about whether Trump disclosed highly classified_information to the Russians Thats confirmation that this detailin the article is correctA reporter asked whether Trump shared sensitive information received from a partner Again McMaster does_not deny that aspect of the article So thats further confirmation that a key detail of the story is correctThis is a judgment call but what White_House is going to say the president did something inappropriate The_Post article merely noted some of the possible consequences from Trump sharing the information but made no judgment on whether Trump had the authority totake the action he tookMcMaster confirms another key detail in the article that Thomas P Bossert assistant to the president for homeland_security and counterterrorism placed calls to the directors of the CIA and the NSA to inform them that the president shared the information toRussia (The Post also reported that one of Bosserts subordinates also called for the problematic portion of Trumps discussion to be stricken from internal memos) Its a bit strange that McMaster would not have discussed this with one of his key subordinates so were dubiousabout the credibility of that commentAgain this gets back to the White_House trying to push back against the idea that Trump did something wrong Which White_House aide is going to publicly admit that a presidents decision was inappropriate By naming three officials McMaster is trying to elevate this point but again its a judgment call that does_not call into the question the keyfacts contained in the articleMcMaster confirms another detail in the article that this was a spur of the moment decision by the president not part of the meetingplanMcMaster asked if Trump revealed the city where the intelligence was gathered again does_not deny this specific element of the article Instead he says the name would be familiar to anyone reading about the Islamic_State This is an interesting bit of spin because the article says White_House officials had specifically asked The Washington_Post not to reveal the name of the cityMcMaster actually has no way of knowing the possible consequences of Trump sharing the information The_Post article noted the concerns of several US officials familiar_with the intelligence and how it was gathered including that Russia could use it to help identify the US ally or intelligence capability involved especially if it involved intelligence on Russias activities in SyriaThis is deflection The president would not necessarily know sources of intelligence unless he specifically asked But intelligence is So presumably Trump knew that before he shared it with RussiaIn the course of two media appearances McMaster essentially confirmed thatThese are the key factual elementsof the Post article The only real issue in dispute is whether Trumps actions hurt the intelligence-gathering methods of the United_States and intelligence cooperation with friendly countries That will be up to the judgment of history()The Environmental Protection_Agency has given notice to dozens ofscientists that they will not be renewed in their roles in advising the agency continuing a scientific shake-up that has already triggered resignations and charges from some researchers that the administration is politicizing the agencyMembers of the EPAs Board of Scientific Counselors (BOSC) whose terms end in August will not see them renewed according to an email sent to members and obtained by The Washington_Post though they can reapply for their posts Moreover five meetings of subcommittees of the board planned for the late summer and the fall will now be canceled because of lack of membership They will be held once the board is reconstituted according to EPA officialsIt effectively wipes out the BOSC and leaves it free for a complete reappointment said Deborah Swackhamer theof the boards executive committee and an emeritus professor of environmental health sciences at the University of MinnesotaThat executive committee has only five remaining members after The board also has five subcommittees but according to an email from Swackhamer with the latest information from EPA 38 of the 49 remaining subcommittee members will not be renewed at the end of AugustEPA officials said the fact that many advisers terms were ending provided an opportunity to reach out to a broad array of applicants and draw on their expertiseEPA is grateful for the service of all BOSC members past and present and has encouraged those with expiring terms to reapply said agency spokeswoman Amy GrahamWe are taking an inclusive approach to filling future BOSC appointments and welcome all applicants from all relevant scientific and technical fieldsThe announcement sent from acting assistant administrator of the Office of Research and Development Robert Kavlock said that members can reapply but have aJune 30 deadline to do soMembers are appointed to three-year terms but they are traditionally renewed for another term if they choose to continue serving Officials in the previous administration had told several advisers they should expect to serve longer than one term but that is not dictated under board rulesTo be renewed for a second term is usually anticipated expected and the only time you might not serve a second term is if your expertise was no_longer needed Swackhamer saidThe EPAs Board of Scientific Counselors advises the agencys Office of Research and Development which is being targeted for extremely deep budget cuts on whether the research it does has sufficient rigor and integrity and addresses important scientific questionsPeter Meyer an economist with the EP Systems Group who had already from theboards subcommitteeto protest the ongoingshake-up said that he and his colleagues had thought they would be staying onWe were told quite explicitly by the leadership of the sustainable and healthy communities group that our assignment was a four-to-five-year assignment Meyer said That was what we were told at our first meeting That produces an assumption that youre going to get reappointed so that you can complete the job Scott Openshaw a spokesman for the American Chemistry Council which represents the chemical industry said in an email that the turnover would address his groups and others concerns in the past that EPA advisory_boards did_not include a diversity of views and therefore frequently presented a biased perspective on issues before themAll stakeholders industry and consumers benefit by ensuring regulations are based on the best science available he added We are hopeful Administrator Pruitts actions will help to ensure regulatory decisions are based on the highest quality science enhance accountability create greater balance more transparency and fewer conflicts of interest on EPA advisory boardsMeyer however said that he fears the goal is to clear out the membership of these boards so that new members can be appointed perhaps those who are more favorable to the communities actually being regulated by the EPAElena Craft a researcher based at the advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund who serves on a subcommittee of the board focused on also said she received the notice MondayIts just yet_another example of the administrations disregard for independent scientific counsel on issues that are critically important to the nation Craft said She added that her subcommittee was scheduled to meet in September but thats now offThis gives_me a great deal of concern about the erosion of science in this administration said Robert Richardson an ecological economist and associate professor in Michigan State UniversitysDepartment of Community Sustainability who co-chaired one of the BOSC subcommittees and was let go earlier_this spring Its hard to understand the rationale behind a decision like this I understand they might simply want to repopulate [the board] with people of their own choosing However this could also be a way of just weakening advisory_boards of diminishing their role by not replacing membersRichardson said other colleagues had contacted him this week about the news that the EPA would not renew the terms of dozens of additional scientific advisers to the agencyI dont_think anybody is terribly surprised he said [Trump officials] have been clear that they intend to wipe all these slates clean They want no continuity from any decisions that were made by the previous administration even nonpolitical decisionsRichardson said serving as an effective outsider adviser to the EPA comes with a steep learning curve and that over the years he and his colleagues had worked hard during their years on the board to build a rapport with EPAs Office of Research and Development and to serve the agency effectivelyAll that knowledge will be lost he saidPruitt has taken a deep interest in what scientific questions the EPA should be exploring in the coming years according to his aides and a transformation of the board could make a shift in focus easier to carry out Many Republicans have criticized the agency for devoting too_much of its resources toward climate_change in recent_years as opposed to more traditional environmental threatsThis appears tobe just the start of advisory committee changes at the EPA The agencys Science Advisory Board (SAB) and Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) also likely will be changed in the futureOne senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing conversations said that a segment of the Scientific Advisory Board rotates off each year and the agency will issue a Federal Register notice in the next couple of weeks that will invite applicants to replace those members whose terms are expiringEPA is currently deliberating next steps for the SAB and CASAC said one senior agency official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because no final decision has been madePresident Trump declared Tuesday that counterprotesters at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville acted violently and should share the blame for the that left a woman dead and many injuredSpeaking at Trump_Tower in Manhattan the president called the events of Saturday at the Unite the Right rally a horrible thing to watch but he emphasized that both_sides acted irresponsiblyI think theres blame on both_sides And I have no_doubt about it Trump saidYou had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent he added No one wants to say that but Ill say it right_now You had a group on the other side that came charging in without a permit and they were very very violentTrumps remarks came a day after he belatedly condemned the Ku_Klux Klan neo-Nazis and other hate groups that organized and participated in the rally He had faced mounting pressure from lawmakers and civil_rights groups over his failure to do so during his initial reaction to the violence when he denounced violence on many sides But Tuesday Trump defended his handling of the Charlottesville situation stating he did_not want to jump to conclusions in his initial remarks There was no way of making a correct statement that early he said in an impromptu news_conference in the lobby of Trump_Tower after an announcement about infrastructure I had to see the facts unlike a lot of reportersTrump called the driver of the car that killed counterprotester Heather Heyer 32 and injured 19 a disgrace to himself his family and the country but he stopped short of declaring the action a case of domestic terrorism calling that an exercise in semantics Attorney_General Jeff_Sessions has said that the act fits that definition and the Justice_Department has launched a federal civil_rights probe into Heyers death Prosecutors have charged James Alex Fields Jr of Ohio who has reportedly espoused Nazi propaganda and participated in the rally with the crimeYou can call it terrorism You can call it murder You can call it whatever you want Trump said I call it the fastest outcome to a good verdict You get into legal semantics The driver of the car was a murderer What he did was a horrible horrible inexcusable thing Trump emphasized repeatedly that he believed many of the Unite the Right rally participants were not members of hate groups and were there to protest the pending removal by the city of a statue of the Confederate Gen Robert_E LeeYou had people in that group who were protesting the taking down of what to them is a very very important statue Trump said before suggesting that Lee and other Confederate-era generals including Stonewall Jackson are the victims of historical revisionism attempting to delegitimize their rolesSpeaking rhetorically Trump asked reporters whether George Washington and Thomas Jefferson both slave owners should suffer the same fate and have their statues removed Youre changing history youre changing culture he saidTrump reiterated his condemnation of neo-Nazis and other white_supremacists But he also made clear that he believed that some of the counterprotesters were armed and took aggressive actions that helped spark the violenceWhat about the alt-left that came charging at the alt-right do they have any semblance of guilt Trump said They came charging clubs in hand swinging clubsLawmakers on both_sides of the aisle including Sens Marco_Rubio (R-Fla) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) quickly denounced Trumps remarksMr Presidentyou cant allow to share only part of blameThey support idea which cost nation & world so much pain 5/6 Marco_Rubio (@marcorubio) As a Jew as an American as a human words cannot express my disgust and disappointment This is not my President Brian Schatz (@brianschatz) But in a sign of how Trumps stance would be embraced by white nationalist groups David Duke a former KKK leader thanked Trump for his honesty & courageThank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa David Duke (@DrDavidDuke)President Trump on Friday directed the Pentagon to ban the recruitment of openly transgender_people but is leaving it to military leaders to determine_whether individuals already in the armed_forces should be allowed to continue to serveThe presidential memorandum signed by Trump will also prevent the military from providing medical treatment for sex- reassignment surgeriesTrump is reversing an Obama_administration policy that was the latest step in the advancement of rights for lesbian gay bisexual and transgender_people in the US military in recent_years But the White_House said Trump thinks his predecessor failed to provide sufficient basis to determine_whether terminating the Defense Departments long-standing policy on transgender individuals would hinder military effectiveness and lethality disrupt unit cohesion or tax military resourcesThe memorandum states thatfurther study is necessary to ensure that the policy change will not have negative effects on military readinessIn June_2016 President_Barack Obama allowed transgender soldiers to serve_openly and receive related medical treatment while ordering the Pentagon to determine a policy for allowing transgender_people to join the armed_forces within a yearBut Defense_Secretary Jim_Mattis earlier_this year delayed the entry of transgender_troops until January 2018 citing the need to further evaluate the impact on the militarys readiness and cohesionThe memorandum comes weeks after Trump abruptly announced the ban It was not immediately implemented by the military which said it would wait for further guidance from the White HouseAfter consultation with my_Generals and military experts_please be advised that the United_States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the US Military Trump tweeted Our_military must be focused on decisive and overwhelmingvictory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous_medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entailTrumps initial announcementfrom Democrats and Republicans many of whom said it was discriminatory toward transgender_people willing to volunteer to serve their countryAny American who meets current medical and readiness standards should be allowed to continue serving Sen John_McCain (R-Ariz) said in a statement issued after Trumps Twitter announcement of the ban There is no reason to force service_members who are able to fight train and deploy to leave the military regardless of their gender identityThe memo released Friday gives the Pentagon six_months to determine how to implement Trumps directive as it relates to transgender_people currently serving Until that determination is made no action will be taken against any individuals the memo states That plan will be implemented by March 23 2018A senior administration official defended the presidents actions in a call with reporters Friday saying the decision was made based on national_security concernsThe basis for this directive is very much our national_security needs and things like military readiness effectiveness lethality unit cohesion etcetera said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the details of the policy Hes going to continue to ensure that the rights of the LGBT community as well as all Americans are protectedDemocrats and civil_rights groups heavily criticized the announcement calling it a step backwardThe Commander-in-Chief is ordering the Pentagon to hurt and humiliate thousands of Americans who serve in our military with strength and courage House Minority Leader Nancy_Pelosi (D-Calif) said in a statement Prejudice not the national defense is behind President Trumps cruel decision to kick transgender_troops out of the militaryThe prohibition on funding sex-reassignment surgeries will also go into effect on March 23 2018 with an exception for individuals currently undergoing the proceduresTrumps decision thrust his administration into a contentious debate about rapidly changing norms around sexual orientation and gender identity The ban on transgender_service members was the last such prohibition to be removed after thedont ask dont tell policy toward openly gay and lesbian service_members was repealed in 2010Trumps decision was made in part because of strenuous lobbying from who had threatened to hold up a spending bill with money allocated for a border wall a key policy priority for the president if the military was allowed to pay for sex-reassignment surgeriesWhile Trump addressed that issue he also made far more sweeping changes to the militarys policy toward transgender individuals surprising many in his own party and even advocates who opposed allowing transgender_people to serveTrumps announcement was followed by no action for weeks and his short-circuiting of the policymaking process on the issue caught military officials by surprisePentagon spokeswomanDana White acknowledged Friday that the Defense_Department had received Trumps memorandumMore information will be forthcoming White saidSPICER Morning Thanks for being here (ph) (inaudible) days away from the inauguration of the next president and vice_president of the United_States Its an opportunity to be here today to allow the president-elect to take your questionsAfter the president-elect makes some remarks he will introduce Ms Sheri Dillon a prominent attorney in Washington DC with the prestigious firm of Morgan Lewis who will -- who structured the agreements pursuant to the presidents business arrangements and she will give brief remarksBefore we start I want to bring your attention to a few points on the report that was published in BuzzFeed last night Its frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a left-wing blog that was openly hostile to the president-elects campaign to drop highly salacious and flat out false information on the internet just days before he takes the oath of officeAccording to BuzzFeeds own editor there are some serious reasons to doubt the allegations in the report The executive editor of the New_York Times also dismissed the report by saying it was quote Totally unsubstantiated echoing the concerns that many other reporters expressed on the internetSPICER The fact that BuzzFeed and CNN made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks The report is not an intelligence report plain and simple One issue that the report talked about was the relationship of three individuals associated with the campaign These three individuals Paul_Manafort Michael_Cohen and Carter PageCarter Page is an individual who the president-elect does_not know and was put on notice months_ago by the campaign Paul_Manafort has adamantly denied any of this involvement and Michael_Cohen who is said to have visited Prague in August and September did_not leave or enter the United_States during this time We asked him to produce his passport to confirm his whereabouts on the dates in question and there was no_doubt that he was not in PragueIn fact Mr Cohen has never been in Prague A new report actually suggests that Michael_Cohen was at -- at the University of Southern California with his son at a baseball game One report now suggested apparently its another Michael_Cohen For all the talk lately about fake_news this political witch_hunt by some in the media is based on some of the most flimsy reporting and is frankly shameful and disgracefulWith that it is my honor to introduce the next vice_president of the United_States Mike Pence(APPLAUSE)PENCE We are nine days away from the inauguration of the 45th president of the United_States of America(APPLAUSE)I am profoundly honored and humbled that I will take the oath of office to serve as vice_president of the United_States nine days from today but Im even more honored to stand shoulder to shoulder with a new president who will make America great again(APPLAUSE)Now the president-elects leadership and his energy during the campaign was impressive But as the Chairman of the transition effort I can assure the American people that his energy and his vision during the course of this transition has been even more inspiring To see the way he has brought together men and women of extraordinary capability at a historic pace in this cabinetNineteen of the 21 Cabinet officials have been announced nine committee hearings already scheduled seven more soon to go on the books in the next several days and it is a -- it is a compilation of men and women with an unprecedented caliber of leadership and background to help this administration move our nation forward Perhaps thats why theres been such a concerted effort by some in the mainstream media to delegitimize this election and to demean our incoming administrationYou know I have long been a supporter of a free and independent press and I always will be But with freedom comes responsibility And the irresponsible decision of a few news_organizations to run with a false and unsubstantiated report when most news_organizations resisted the temptation to propagate this fake_news can only be attributed to media bias and attempt to demean the president-elect and our incoming administration and the American people are sick and tired of it(APPLAUSE)But today well get back to real news to real facts and the real progress our incoming president has already made in reviving the American economy and assembling a team that will make America great again And well hear from the president-elect about issues that are of paramount importance to the American people todaySo it is my honor to introduce to all of you my friend and the president-elect of the United_States of America Donald Trump(APPLAUSE)TRUMP Thank_you very muchIts very familiar territory news_conferences because we used to give them on a almost daily basis I_think we probably maybe won the nomination because of news_conferences and its good to be with youTRUMP We stopped giving them because we were getting quite a bit of inaccurate news but I do have to say that -- and I must say that I want to thank a lot of the news_organizations here today because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence_agencies Who knows but maybe the intelligence_agencies which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that A tremendous blot because a thing like that should have never been written it should never have been had and it should certainly never been releasedBut I want to thank a lot of the news_organizations for some of whom have not treated me very well over the years -- a couple in particular -- and they came out so strongly against that fake_news and the fact that it was written about by primarily one group and one television stationSo I just want to compliment many of the people in the room I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that But I will tell_you there were some news_organizations with all that was just said that were so professional -- so incredibly professional that Ive just gone up a notch as to what I_think of you OKAll right Weve had some great news over the last couple of weeks Ive been quite active I_guess you could say in an economic way for the country A lot of car companies are going to be moving in we have other companies -- big news is going to be announced over the next couple of weeks about companies that are getting building in the MidwestYou saw yesterday Fiat Chrysler big big factory going to be built in this country as opposed to another country Ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion dollar plant in Mexico and theyre_going to be moving into Michigan and expanding very substantially an existing plantI appreciate that from Ford I appreciate it very much from Fiat Chrysler I_hope that General Motors will be following and I_think they will be I_think a lot of people will be following I_think a lot of industries are going to be coming backWeve got to get our drug industry back Our drug industry has been disastrous Theyre leaving left and right They supply our drugs but they dont make them here to a large extent And the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry because theyre getting away with murderPharma pharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and theres very little bidding on drugs Were the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we dont bid properly and were going to start bidding and were going to save billions of dollars over a period of timeAnd were going to do that with a lot of other industries Im very much involved with the generals and admirals on the airplane the F-35 youve been reading about it And its way way behind schedule and many many billions of dollars over budget I dont like that And the admirals have been fantastic the generals have been fantastic Ive really gotten to know them well And were going to do some big things on the F-35 program and perhaps the F-18 program And were going to get those costs way down and were going to get the plane to be even better And were going to have some competition and its going to be a beautiful thingSo weve been very very much involved and other things We had Jack Ma we had so many incredible people coming here There are no -- theyre_going to do tremendous things -- tremendous things in this country And theyre very excitedAnd I will say if the election didnt turn out the way it turned_out they would not be here They would not be in my office They would not be in anybody elses office Theyd be building and doing things in other countries So theres a great spirit going on right_now A spirit that many people have told me theyve never seen before everWere going to create jobs I said that I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created And I mean that I really -- Im_going to work very hard on that We_need certain amounts of other things including a little_bit of luck but I_think were going to do a real job And Im very proud of what weve doneAnd we havent even gotten there yet I look very much forward to the inauguration Its going to be a beautiful event We have great talent tremendous talent And we have the -- all of the bands -- or most of the bands are from the different -- from the different segments of the military And Ive heard some of these bands over the years theyre incredibleWere going to have a very very elegant day The 20th is going to be something that will be very very special very beautiful And I_think were going to have massive crowds because we have a movementTRUMP Its a movement like the world has never seen before Its a movement that a lot of people didnt expect And even the polls -- although some of them did get it right but many of them didnt And that was a beautiful scene on November 8th as those states started to pour inAnd we focused very hard in those states and they really reciprocated And those states are gonna have a lot of jobs and theyre gonna have a lot of security Theyre going to have a lot of good news for their veteransAnd by the way speaking of veterans I appointed today the head secretary of the Veterans Administration David Shulkin And well do a news release in a little while Tell you about David hes fantastic -- hes fantastic He will do a truly great jobOne of the commitments I made is that were gonna straighten out the whole situation for our veterans Our veterans have been treated horribly Theyre waiting in line for 15 16 17 days cases where they go in and they have a minor early-stage form of cancer and they cant see a doctor By the time they get to the doctor theyre terminal Not gonna happen its not gonna happenSo David is going to do a fantastic job Were_going to be talking to a few people also to help David And we have some of the great hospitals of the world going to align themselves with us on the Veterans Administration like the Cleveland Clinic like the Mayo Clinic a few more_than we have And were gonna set_up a -- a groupThese are hospitals that have been the top of the line the absolute top of the line And theyre_going to get together with their great doctors -- Dr Toby Cosgrove as you know from the Cleveland Clinic has been very involvedIke Perlmutter has been very very involved one of the great men of business And were gonna straighten out the VA for our veterans Ive been promising that for a long time and its something I feel very very stronglySo youll get the information on David And I_think youll be very impressed with the job he does We looked long and hard We interviewed at_least 100 people some good some not so good But we had a lot of talent And we think this election will be something that will with time -- with time straighten it out and straighten it out for good cause our veterans have been treated very unfairlyOK questions Yes John (ph)QUESTION (Inaudible) so muchTRUMP Thank youQUESTION Appreciate itA couple of aspects of the intelligence briefing that you received on Friday that were looking for further clarification onTRUMP SureQUESTION First of all did the heads of the intelligence_agencies provide you with the two-page summary of these unsubstantiated allegations And secondly to that on the broader picture do you accept their opinion that Vladimir_Putin ordered the hack of the DNC and the attempted hack of the RNCAnd if you do how will that color your attempts to build a relationship with a leader who has been accused of committing an act of espionage against the United StatesTRUMP OK first of all these readings as you know are confidential classified So Im not allowed to talk about what went on in a meetingAnd -- but we had many witnesses in that meeting many of them with us And I will say again I_think its a disgrace that information would be let outI saw the information I read the information outside of that meeting Its all fake_news Its phony stuff It didnt happen And it was gotten by opponents of ours as you know because you reported it and so did many of the other people It was a group of opponents that got together -- sick people -- and they put that crap togetherSo I will tell_you that not within the meeting but outside of the meeting somebody released it It should have never been -- number one shouldnt have even entered paper But it should have never have been released But I read what was released and I_think its a disgrace I_think its an absolute disgraceAs far as hacking I_think it was Russia But I_think we also get hacked by other countries and other people And I -- I can say that you know when -- when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently they didnt make a big deal out of that That was something that was extraordinary That was probably ChinaWe had -- we had much hacking going on And one of the things were gonna do we have some of the greatest computer minds anywhere in the world that weve assembled You saw just a sample of it two_weeks ago up here where we had the six top people in the world -- they were never in the same room together as a group And were gonna put those minds together and were going to form a defenseTRUMP And I have to say this also the Democratic_National Committee was totally open to be hacked They did a very poor job They couldve had hacking defense which we hadAnd I will give Reince_Priebus credit because when Reince saw what was happening in the world and with this country he went out and went to various firms and ordered a very very strong hacking defenseAnd they tried to hack the Republican_National Committee and they were unable to break throughWe have to do that for our_country Its very important(CROSSTALK)QUESTION just to the last part of that question (inaudible) how could all of this potentially color your attempts to build a better relationship with President PutinTRUMP Well you know President Putin and Russia put out a statement today that this fake_news was indeed fake_news They said it totally never happenedNow somebody would say Oh of course hes gonna say thatI respected the fact that he said thatAnd I -- Ill be honest I_think if he did have something they wouldve released it they wouldve been glad to release itI think frankly had they broken into the Republican_National Committee I_think they wouldve released it just like they did about Hillary and all of the horrible things that her people like Mr Podesta said about her I mean what he said about her was horribleIf somebody said about me what Podesta said about Hillary I was the boss I wouldve fired him immediately or that person Because what he said about her was horribleBut remember this We talk about the hacking and hackings bad and it shouldnt be done But look at the things that were hacked look at what was learned from that hackingThat Hillary_Clinton got the questions to the debate and didnt report it Thats a horrible thing Thats a horrible thingCan you imagine that if Donald Trump got the questions to the debate -- it wouldve been the biggest story in the history of stories And they wouldve said immediately You have to get out of the race Nobody even talked about it Its a very terrible thingYeahQUESTION Can I ask you a question sir(CROSSTALK)QUESTION Thank_you Mr President-electOn that intelligence report the second part of their conclusion was that Vladimir_Putin ordered it because he aspired to help you in the electionDo you accept that part of the finding And will you undo what President Obama did to punish the Russians for this or will you keep it in placeTRUMP Well if -- if Putin likes Donald Trump I consider that an asset not a liability because we have a horrible relationship with Russia Russia can help us fight ISIS which by the way is number one tricky I mean if you look this administration created ISIS by leaving at the wrong time The void was created ISIS was formedIf Putin likes Donald Trump guess what folks Thats called an asset not a liabilityNow I dont_know that Im gonna get along with Vladimir_Putin I_hope I do But theres a good chance I wont And if I dont do you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me Does anybody in this room really believe that Give me a breakOK(CROSSTALK)QUESTION President Obama(CROSSTALK)QUESTION make clear whether during your visits to either Moscow or St_Petersburg you engaged in conduct that you now regret and that a reasonable(CROSSTALK)QUESTION Would a reasonable observer say that you are potentially vulnerable to blackmail by Russia or by its intelligence agenciesTRUMP Lemme just tell_you what I doWhen I leave our_country Im a very high-profile person would you sayI am extremely careful Im surrounded by bodyguards Im surrounded by peopleAnd I always tell them -- anywhere but I always tell them if Im leaving this country Be very careful because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go youre gonna probably have cameras Im not referring just to Russia but I would certainly put them in that categoryAnd number one I_hope youre gonna be good anyway But in those rooms you have cameras in the strangest places Cameras that are so small with modern technology you cant see them and you wont know You better be careful or youll be watching yourself on nightly televisionI tell this to people all the timeI was in Russia years_ago with the Miss_Universe contest which did very well -- Moscow the Moscow area did very very wellAnd I told many people Be careful because you dont wanna see yourself on television Cameras all over the placeAnd again not just Russia all overDoes anyone really believe that storyIm also very much of a germaphobe by the way believe me (LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)QUESTION how you plan to disentangle yourself from your business But first I have to follow-up on some of these Russian remarksBased on your comments here today do you believe the hacking was justified Does Russia have any leverage_over you financial or otherwise And if not will you release your tax_returns to prove itTRUMP So I tweeted out that I have no dealings with Russia I have no deals that could happen in Russia because weve stayed away And I have no loans with RussiaAs a real_estate developer I have very very little debt I have assets that are -- and now people have found out how big the company is I have very little debt -- I have very low debt But I have no loans with Russia at allAnd I thought that was important to put out I certified that So I have no deals I have no loans and I have no dealings We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to I just dont_want to because I_think that would be a conflict So I have no loans no dealings and no current pending dealsNow I have to say one other thing Over the weekend I was offered $2_billion to do a deal in Dubai with a very very very amazing man a great great developer from the Middle_East Hussein Damack a friend of mine great guy And I was offered $2_billion to do a deal in Dubai -- a number of deals and I turned it downI didnt have to turn it down because as you know I have a no-conflict situation because Im president which is -- I didnt know about that until about three months_ago but its a nice thing to have But I dont_want to take_advantage of something I have something that others dont have Vice_President Pence also has it I dont_think hell need it I have a feeling hes not going to need itBut I have a no conflict of interest provision as president It was many many years old this is for presidents Because they dont_want presidents getting -- I understand they dont_want presidents getting tangled up in minutia they want a president to run the country So I could actually run my business I could actually run my business and run government at the same timeI dont like the way that looks but I would be able to do that if I wanted to I would be the only one to be able to do that You cant do that in any other capacity But as president I could run the Trump organization great great company and I could run the company -- the country Id do a very good job but I dont_want to do thatNow all of these papers that you see here -- yes go_aheadQUESTION (inaudible) do you believe the hacking was justified And will you release your tax_returns to prove what youre saying about no deals in RussiaTRUMP Im not releasing the tax_returns because as you know theyre under audit(CROSSTALK)QUESTION since the 70s has had a required audit from the IRS the last place to release them but as president sirTRUMP You_know the only one that cares about my tax_returns are the reporters OK Theyre the only who askQUESTION You dont_think the American public is concerned about itTRUMP No I dont_think so I won when I became president No I dont_think they care at all I dont_think they care at all(APPLAUSE)TRUMP I_think you care -- I_think you care First of all you learn very little to a tax return What you should go down to federal elections and take a look at the numbers And actually people have learned a lot about my company and now they realize my company is much bigger much more powerful than they ever thought Were in many many countries and Im very proud of itAnd what Im_going to be doing is my two sons who are right here Don and Eric are going to be running the company They are going to be running it in a very professional manner Theyre not going to discuss it with me Again I dont have to do this Theyre not going to discuss it with me And with that Im_going to bring up Sheri Dillon and shes going to go -- these papers are just some of the many documents that Ive signed turning over complete and total control to my sons(CROSSTALK)DILLON Good morning Its my honor and privilege to be here today at President-elect Trumps requestHes asked me as you just heard to speak about the conflicts of interest and the steps hes taking As you know the business_empire built by President-elect Trump over the years is massive not dissimilar to the fortunes of Nelson Rockefeller when he became vice_president But at that time no one was so concernedPresident-elect Trump wants the American public to rest assured that all of his efforts are directed to pursuing the peoples business and not his own To that end as he explained a few moments ago he directed me and my colleagues at the law_firm Morgan Lewis and Bockius to design a structure for his business_empire that will completely isolate him from the management of the companyHe further instructed that we build in protections that will assure the American people the decisions he makes and the actions that he takes as president are for their benefit and not to support his financial interestsDILLON As he said hes voluntarily taking this on The conflicts of interest laws simply do not apply to the president or the vice_president and they are not required to separate themselves from their financial assets The primary conflicts of interest statutes and some have questioned it is Section 18 USC 208 and its simply inapplicable by its terms And this is not just our interpretation Its Congress itself who have made this clear in 1989 when it amended Section 18 USC 202 to state that except as otherwise provided the terms office and employee in section 208 shall not include the presidentEven so President-elect Trump wants there to be no_doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business_interests He instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit He also sought the guidance of individuals who are familiar_with and have worked extensively in the fields of government ethics and constitutional lawCritical to the Morgan Lewis team is Fred Fielding standing here to our side and with us today and many of you have known him He has served several presidents over the years including serving as counsel to Presidents Ronald_Reagan and George_W Bush as well as serving on President George_HW Bushs Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform and he also held the position of vice chair of the Ethics Resource CenterMr Fielding has been extensively involved with and approved this plan Hes here today to support the plan and he will_continue to provide guidance as the plan is implemented and as Eric Don along with others take over management of the Trump organizationIm gonna detail some of the extraordinary steps now that the president-elect is taking First President-elect Trumps investments and business assets commonly_known as the -- as the Trump_Organization comprising hundreds of entities which again if you all go and take a look at his financial disclosure statement the pages and pages and pages of entities have all been or will be conveyed to a trust prior to January 20th Here is just some of the paperwork thats taking care of those actionsSecond through the trust_agreement he has relinquished leadership and management of the Trump_Organization to his sons Don and Eric and a longtime Trump executive Allen Weisselberg Together Don Eric and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump_Organization and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by President-elect TrumpFurther at the president-elects direction the trust_agreement provides -- that to ensure the Trump_Organization continues to operate in accordance with the highest and legal ethics standards an ethics adviser will be appointed to the management team The written approval of the ethics adviser will be required for new deals actions and transactions that could potentially raise ethics or conflicts of interest concernsPresident-elect Trump as well as Don Eric and Allen are committed to ensuring that the activities of the Trump organization are beyond reproach and cannot be perceived to be exploitive of the office of the presidency President-elect Trump will resign from all officer and other positions he holds with the Trump_Organization entitiesFurther in addition his daughter_Ivanka will have no further involvement with or management authority whatsoever with the Trump_Organization As she and Jared move their family to DC Ivanka will focused on settling her children into their new homes and their new schoolsThe president-elect has also already disposed of all of his investments in publicly traded or easily liquidated investments As a result the trust will have two types of assets first it will hold liquid assets Cash cash equivalents and treasuries and perhaps some positions in a government approved diversified portfolio one that is consistent with the regulations from the Office of Government EthicsSecond the trust is going to hold his preexisting illiquid but very valuable business assets the ones that everyone here is familiar_with Trump owned operated and branded golf clubs commercial rental property resorts hotels rights to royalties from preexisting licenses of Trump-Marks Productions and Goods Things like Trump_Tower Mar-a-Lago all of his other business assets 40 Wall_Street will all be in the trustThrough instructions in the trust_agreement President-elect trust -- President-elect Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated This impacted more_than 30 deals many of which were set to close by the end of 2016 As you can well imagine that caused an immediate financial loss of millions of dollars not just for President-elect Trump but also for Don Ivanka and EricDILLON The trust_agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trumps presidency New domestic deals will be allowed but they will go through a vigorous vetting processThe president-elect will have no role in deciding whether the Trump_Organization engages in any new deal and he will only know of a deal if he reads it in the paper or sees it on TV Because any new deal could -- and I emphasize could -- be perceived as causing a conflict or as exploiting the office of the presidency new deals must be vetted with the ethics adviser whose role will be to analyze any potential transactions for conflicts and ethics issuesThe ethics adviser will be a recognized expert in the field of government experts Again his role will be to scrutinize the new deals and the actions and any new deal must receive written approvalTo further reinforce the wall that we are building between President-elect Trump and the Trump_Organization President-elect Trump has ordered through his trust_agreement to sharply limit his information rights Reports will only be available and reflect profit and loss on the company as a whole There will be no separate business by business accountingAnother step that President-elect Trump has taken is he created a new position at the Trump_Organization the position of chief compliance counsel whose responsibility will be to ensure that the Trump businesses again are operating at the highest_levels of integrity and not taking any actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency He has also directed that no communications of the Trump_Organization including social_media accounts will reference or be tied to President-elect Trumps role as president of the United_States or the office of the presidencyIn sum all of these actions -- complete relinquishment of management no foreign deals ethics adviser approval of deals sharply limited information rights -- will sever President-elect Trumps presidency from the Trump OrganizationSome have asked questions Why not divest Why not just sell everything Form of blind_trust And Id like to turn to addressing some of those questions nowSelling first and foremost would not eliminate possibilities of conflicts of interest In fact it would exacerbate them The Trump brand is key to the value of the Trump Organizations assets If President-elect Trump sold his brand he would be entitled to royalties for the use of it and this would result in the trust retaining an interest in the brand without the ability to assure that it does_not exploit the office of the presidencyFurther whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutiny Was it too high is there pay for play was it too_much pay to curry favor with the president-elect And selling his assets without the rights to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire salePresident-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built This plan offers a suitable alternative to address the concerns of the American people and selling the entire Trump_Organization isnt even feasibleSome people have suggested that the president-elect sell the business to his adult children This would require massive third-party debt sourced with multiple lenders whose motives and willingness to participate would be questioned and undoubtedly investigated And if the president-elect were to finance the sale himself he would retain the financial interests in the assets that he owns nowSome people have suggested that the Trump -- that President-elect Trump could bundle the assets and turn the Trump_Organization into a public company Anyone who has ever gone through this extraordinarily cumbersome and complicated process knows that it is a non-starter It is not realistic and it would be inappropriate for the Trump OrganizationSome people have suggested a blind_trust but you cannot have a totally blind_trust with operating businesses President Trump cant unknow he owns Trump_Tower and the press will make_sure that any new developments at the Trump_Organization are well publicizedDILLON Further it would be impossible to find an institutional trustee that would be competent to run the Trump_Organization The approach that he is taking allows Don and Eric to preserve this great company and its iconic assets And this approach is best from a conflicts and ethics perspective It creates a complete separation from President-elect Trump -- it separates him and prevents him from participating in the business and poses strict limits on what the trustees can do and requires the assent of any ethics adviser to a new dealIm going to turn to one last topic today that has been of interest lately called emoluments Thats a word I_think weve all become familiar_with and perhaps had not heard beforeAnd were gonna describe some other actions that President-elect Trump is taking to avoid even the appearance of a conflictEmoluments comes from the Constitution The Constitution says officials may not accept gifts titles of nobility or emoluments from foreign_governments with respect to their office and that no benefit should be derived by holding in officeThe so-called Emoluments Clause has never been interpreted however to apply to fair value exchanges that have absolutely nothing to do with an office holderNo one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument Instead it would have been thought of as a value-for-value exchange not a gift not a title and not an emolumentBut since President-elect Trump has been elected some people want to define emoluments to cover routine business transactions like paying for hotel rooms They suggest that the Constitution prohibits the businesses from even arms-length transactions that the president-elect has absolutely nothing to do with and isnt even aware ofThese people are wrong This is not what the Constitution says Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office Its not an emolumentThe Constitution does_not require President-elect Trump to do anything here But just like with conflicts of interests he wants to do more_than what the Constitution requiresSo President-elect Trump has decided and we are announcing today that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotel to the United_States Treasury This way it is the American people who will profitIn sum I and president-elects (sic) other advisers at Morgan Lewis have determined the approach weve outlined today will avoid potential conflicts of interests or concerns regarding exploitation of the office of the presidency without imposing unnecessary and unreasonable loses on the president-elect and his familyWe believe this structure and these steps will serve to accomplish the president-elects desire to be isolated from his business_interests and give the American people confidence that his sole business and interest is in making America great again bringing back jobs to this country securing our borders and rebuilding our infrastructureThe American people were well -- well aware of President-elect Trumps business_empire and financial interests when they voted Many people voted for him precisely because of his business successPresident-elect Trump wants to bring this success to all Americans Thank you(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)DILLON Youre welcome My pleasure Yes (ph) Dont want to lose your note Thank youTRUMP Thank_you very much Here you go you (ph)DILLON Thank youQUESTION Mr Trump Thank_you Mr Trump (inaudible) from America NewsWhat is your response to your critics that say not only you but also your Cabinet is filled with conflicts of interestAnd do you plan to set an example in the future to make_sure that your -- your Cabinet and everyone throughout your administration(CROSSTALK)TRUMP I -- I really think that when you watch whats_going on with whats_happening in -- I was just watching as an example Rex_Tillerson I_think its brilliant what hes doing and what hes sayingI watched yesterday as you know our great senator who is going to be a great attorney_general And he was brilliant And what people dont_know is that he was a great prosecutor and attorney_general in Alabama And he was brilliant yesterdaySo I really think that they are -- I_think we have one of the great Cabinets ever put together And weve been hearing that from so many people People are so happyYou know in the case of Rex he ran incredibly Exxon Mobil When there was a find he would get it When they needed something he would be thereA friend of mine whos very very substantial in the oil business Harold Hamm -- big supporter -- he said theres nobody in the business like Rex TillersonAnd thats what we want Thats what I want to bring to governmentI want to bring the greatest people into government because were way behind We dont make good deals any more I say it all the time in speeches We dont make good deals anymore we make bad deals Our trade deals are a disasterTRUMP We have hundreds of billions of dollars of losses on a yearly basis -- hundreds of billions with China on trade and trade imbalance with Japan with Mexico with just about everybody We dont make good deals anymoreSo we need people that are smart we need people that are successful and they got successful because generally speaking theyre smart And thats what Id put Im very proud of the Cabinet I_think theyre doing very wellIts very interesting how its going but its -- I_think theyre doing very very well(CROSSTALK)QUESTION a quick follow-up on -- on Russia sirQUESTION Thank_you Mr_President-elect I wanted to ask a few questions on ObamacareTRUMP YeahQUESTION Can_you be specific on what guidance youre giving congressional Republicans on the timeline for repeal and replace whether it needs to be simultaneous or(CROSSTALK)TRUMP Finally Obamacare I thought it was never gonna be askedQUESTION (OFF-MIKE) though if you have outlined a plan for what you want the replace package to look like would it guarantee coverage for those who have gotten health_insurance through the current Obamacare lawTRUMP Youre gonna be very very proud as not only the media and reporters youre gonna be very proud of what we put forth having to do with health_care Obamacare is a complete and total disasterThey can say what they want they can guide you anyway they wanna guide you In some cases they guide you incorrectly In most cases you realize whats_happened its imploding as we sitSome states have over a hundred percent increase and 17 and I said this two years_ago 17 is going to be the bad year Its going to be catastrophic Frankly we could sit back and it was a thought from a political standpoint but it wouldnt be fair to the peopleWe could sit back and wait and watch and criticize and we could be a Chuck Schumer and sit back and criticize it and people would come they would come begging to us please we have to do something about Obamacare We dont wanna own it we dont wanna own it politically They own it right nowSo the easiest thing would be to let it implode in 17 and believe me wed get pretty much whatever we wanted but it would take a long time Were_going to be submitting as soon as our secretarys approved almost simultaneously shortly thereafter a planItll be repeal and replace It will be essentially simultaneously It will be various segments you understand but will most_likely be on the same_day or the same week but probably the same_day could be the same hourSo were gonna do repeal and replace very complicated stuff And were gonna get a health bill passed were gonna get health_care taken care of in this country You have deductibles that are so high that after people go broke paying their premiums which are going through the roof the health_care cant even be used by them because their deductibles bills are so highObamacare is the Democrats problem We are gonna take the problem off the shelves for them Were doing them a tremendous service by doing it We could sit back and let them hang with it We are doing the Democrats a great serviceSo as soon as our secretary is approved and gets into the office well be filing a plan And it was actually pretty accurately reported today The New_York Times And the plan will be repeal and replace ObamacareWere going to have a health_care that is far_less expensive and far better OK(CROSSTALK)QUESTION President-elect can we just ask you -- sir sirQUESTION President-elect Trump(CROSSTALK)QUESTION Mr President -- which oneTRUMP I was going right here(CROSSTALK)QUESTION President-elect Trump Jon Steinberg (ph) from Cheddar When you look at all the meetings that youve had with Carrier SoftBank and Alibaba do you conceive of making this a program maybe sitting inside of commerceAnd then my follow-up question to that is how soon will we see the program on capital repatriation and corporate tax cutsTRUMP Well if I can save jobs for instance I was doing individual companies and people said well thats only one company like we did a good job with Carrier And I wanna thank United Technologies which owns Carrier but we saved close to a thousand jobsAnd they were gone and Mike_Pence and his staff really helped us a lot But those were -- that was a tough one because they announced a year and a half before that they were leaving so its always tough when theyre building a plan just a little tougher than before they start or before they make an announcementTRUMP So I wanna thank United Technologies But weve been meeting with a lot of companies But what really is happening is the word is now out that when you want to move your plant to Mexico or some other place and you want to fire all of your workers from Michigan and Ohio and all these places that I won for good reason its not going to happen that way anymoreYou want to move your plant and you think as an example youre going to build that plant in Mexico and youre going to make your air conditioners or your cars or whatever youre making and youre going to sell it through what will be a very very strong border -- not a weak border like it is -- we dont even have a border Its an open sieveBut youre going to sell through a very strong border -- not going to happen Youre going to pay a very large border tax So if you want to move to another country and if you want to fire all of our great American workers that got you there in the first place you can move from Michigan to Tennessee and to North Carolina and South Carolina You can move from South Carolina back to MichiganYou can do anywhere -- youve got a lot of states at play a lot of competition So its not like oh gee Im taking the competition away Youve got a lot of places you can move And I dont care as along as its within the United_States the borders of the United StatesThere will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder And if our politicians had what it takes they would have done this years_ago And youd have millions more workers right_now in the United_States that are -- 96 million really wanting a job and they cant get You_know that story The real number -- thats the real numberSo thats the way it is OK Go_aheadQUESTION President-elect I have a question about the Supreme_Court and border security But I also wanted to ask you about something you said on Twitter this morning Are we living in Nazi Germany What were you driving at there Do_you have a problem with the intelligence communityAnd on the Supreme_Court whats your timeline You said a while ago you were down to four Have you conducted those interviews yet Whats your timeline for nominatingAnd on the border fence it now appears clear US taxpayers will have to pay for it up front What is your plan toTRUMP Thats not clear at all OK(CROSSTALK)QUESTION to get Mexico to pay for itTRUMP Ive got it Do_you have any more(LAUGHTER)On the fence -- its not a fence Its a wall You just misreported it Were_going to build a wall I could wait about a year-and-a-half until we finish our negotiations with Mexico which will start immediately after we get to office but I dont_want to wait Mike_Pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through Congress for the wall to beginI dont feel like waiting a year or a year-and-a-half Were_going to start building Mexico in some form and there are many different forms will reimburse us and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall That will happen whether its a tax or whether its a payment -- probably less likely that its a payment But it will happenSo remember this OK I would say we are going to build a wall and people would go crazy I would then say who is going to pay for the wall And people would all scream out -- 25000 30000 people because nobody has ever had crowds like Trump has had You_know that You dont like to report that but thats OKOK now he agrees Finally he agreesBut I say who is going to pay for the wall And they will scream out MexicoNow reports went out last_week -- oh Mexico is not going to pay for the wall because of a reimbursement Whats the difference I want to get the wall started I dont_want to wait a year-and-a-half until I make my deal with Mexico And we probably will have a deal sooner than thatAnd by the way Mexico has been so nice so nice I respect the government of Mexico I respect the people of Mexico I love the people of Mexico I have many people from Mexico working for me Theyre phenomenal peopleThe government of Mexico is terrific I dont blame them for whats_happened I dont blame them for taking advantage of the United_States I wish our politicians were so smart Mexico has taken advantage of the United_States I dont blame the representatives and various presidents et cetera of Mexico What I say is we shouldnt have allowed that to happen Its not going to happen anymoreSo in order to get the wall started Mexico will pay for the wall but it will be reimbursed OKSupreme Court judge So as you know I have a list of 20 Ive gone through them Weve met with numerous candidates Theyre outstanding in every case They were largely recommended and highly recommended by Federalist Society Jim DeMint was also very much involved and his group which is fantastic and hes a fantastic guyTRUMP So between Leo and Jim DeMint and some senators and some congresspeople we have a great group of people Ill be making the decision on who we will put up for justice of the United_States Supreme_Court a replacement for the great great Justice Scalia That will be probably within two_weeks of the 20th So within about two_weeks probably the second week I consider the first day because well also be doing some -- some pretty good signings and I_think what well do is well wait until MondayThat will be our really first business day as opposed to doing it on Friday because on Friday people are going to have a very good time at the inauguration and then Saturday as you know were having a big church service and lots of good things are happening So our first day -- and youll all be invited to the signings but well be doing some pretty good signings on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday and then also the next week And youre all invitedBut on the Supreme_Court Ill be making that decision and it will be a decision which I very strongly believe in I_think its one of the reasons I got elected I_think the people of this country did_not want to see what was happening with the Supreme_Court so I_think it was a very very big decision as to why I was electedQUESTION The tweet that you had this morning about are we living in Nazi Germany what were you driving at there What are you trying to tell the American publicTRUMP I_think it was disgraceful -- disgraceful that the intelligence_agencies allowed any information that turned_out to be so false and fake out I_think its a disgrace and I say that -- and I say that and thats something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do I_think its a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the publicAs far as Buzzfeed which is a failing pile of garbage writing it I_think theyre_going to suffer the consequences They already are And as far as CNN going out of their way to build it up -- and by the way we just found out I was coming down Michael_Cohen -- I was being -- Michael_Cohen is a very talented lawyer Hes a good lawyer in my firm It was just reported that it wasnt this Michael_Cohen they were talking_about So all night long its Michael CohenI said I want to see your passport He brings his passport to my office I say hey wait a minute He didnt leave the country He wasnt out of the country They had Michael_Cohen of the Trump_Organization was in Prague It turned_out to be a different Michael_Cohen Its a disgrace what took_place Its a disgrace and I_think they ought to apologize to start with Michael CohenQUESTION Since youre attacking us can you give us a question Mr_President-elect --TRUMP Go_aheadQUESTION Mr_President-elect since you are attacking our news organizationTRUMP Not youQUESTION Can_you give us a chanceTRUMP Your organization is terribleQUESTION You are attacking our news organization can you give us a chance to ask a question sir Sir can youTRUMP QuietQUESTION Mr_President-elect can you sayTRUMP Hes asking a question dont be rude Dont be

went too far with the sanctions he put on Russia after the hackingTRUMP I dont_think he went too far NoQUESTION Will you roll them back What do you think of Lindsey Grahams plan to send you a bill forTRUMP Plans to send me a bill for whatQUESTION Tougher sanctionsTRUMP I hadnt heard Lindsey Graham was going to do that Lindsey Graham Ive been competing with him for a long time He is going to crack that one percent barrier one day I didnt realize Lindsey Graham is still at it Thats all right I_think Lindsey Graham is a nice guy Ive heard that he is a nice guy and Ive been hearing itGo ahead Go ahead Youve been waitingQUESTION As far as we understand the intelligence communityTRUMP Stand upQUESTION From BBC news Ian Pannell from BBC newsTRUMP BBC news Thats another beautyQUESTION Thank_you Thank youAs far as we understand it the intelligence_community are still looking at these allegations this false news as you describe it If they come back with any kind of conclusion that any of it stands up that any of it is true will you consider your positionTRUMP Theres nothing they could come back withQUESTION Can youTRUMP Go_aheadQUESTION (inaudible) published fake_news and all the problems that weve_seen throughout the media over the course of the election what reforms do you recommend for this industry hereTRUMP Well I dont recommend reforms I recommend people that are -- that have some moral compassYou know Ive been hearing more and more about a thing called fake_news and theyre talking_about people that go and say all sorts of things But I will tell_you some of the media outlets that I deal with are fake_news more so than anybody I could name them but I wont bother but you have a few sitting right in front of us Theyre very very dishonest people but I_think its just something were going to have to live withTRUMP I_guess the advantage I have is that I can speak back When it happens to somebody that doesnt have this -- doesnt have that kind of a megaphone they cant speak back Its a very sad thing Ive seen people destroyed Ive seen people absolutely destroyed And I_think its very unfair So all I can ask for is honest reportersYes(CROSSTALK)QUESTION I just wanted to follow up on the questions about the US intelligence_community And be very clear about what youre saying Do_you trust your US intelligence officials And what do you say to foreign_policy experts who say youre actually weakening national_security by waging this war of words against that communityTRUMP Intelligence agencies are vital and very very important We are going to be putting in as you know Mr Pompeo and others you know the Senator Dan Coats Were_going to be putting in some outstanding people Within 90 days theyre_going to be coming back to me with a major report on hackingI want them to cover this situation I also want them however to cover maybe most importantly -- because were hacked by everybody -- you know the United_States our government out of a list of 17 in terms of industries is the worst its number 17 in terms of protectionIf you look at the retail industry if you look at the banking industry various industries out of 17 industries -- they put this in the category of an industry -- the United_States is last in terms of protecting lets say hacking defense Like we had a great hacking defense at the Republican_National CommitteeThats why we werent hacked By the way we were told that they were trying to hack us but they werent able to hack And I_think I get some credit because I told Reince and Reince did a phenomenal job but I said I want strong hacking defenseThe Democratic_National Committee didnt do that Maybe thats why the country runs so badly that way But I will tell_you -- wait -- wait -- wait let me finish Within 90 days we will be coming up with a major report on hacking defense how do we stop this new phenomena -- fairly new phenomena because the United_States is hacked by everybodyThat includes Russia and China and everybody -- everybody OK(CROSSTALK)TRUMP Go ahead -- go_aheadQUESTION Mr_President-elect you said just now that you believe Russia indeed was responsible for the hacking of the DNC and Jon Podestas e-mails et ceteraTRUMP All right but you know what it could have been others alsoQUESTION But why did you spend weeks undermining US intelligence_community before simply getting the facts and then making a public statementTRUMP Well I_think its pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press I_think its pretty sad First of all its illegal You_know these are -- these are classified and certified meetings and reportsIll tell_you what does happen I have many meetings with intelligence And every time I meet people are reading about it Somebodys leaking it out So theres -- maybe its my office Maybe in my office because I have a lot of people a lot of great people Maybe its them And what I did is I said I wont tell anybody Im_going to have a meeting and I wont tell anybody about my meeting with intelligenceAnd what_happened is I had my meeting Nobody knew not even Rhona my executive assistant for years she didnt know -- I didnt tell her Nobody knew The meeting was had the meeting was over they left And immediately the word got out that I had a meetingSo I dont_want that -- I dont_want that Its very unfair to the country Its very unfair to our_country whats_happened That report should have never -- first of all it shouldnt have been printed because its not worth the paper its written on And I thank the New_York Times for saying thatI thank a lot of different people for saying that But I will tell_you that should never ever happen OK(CROSSTALK)QUESTION Thank_you Mr_President-elect can you stand here today once and for all and say that no one connected to you or your campaign had any contact with Russia leading up to or during the presidential campaign And if you do indeed believe that Russia was behind the hacking what is your message to Vladimir_Putin right nowTRUMP He shouldnt be doing it He wont be doing it Russia will have much greater respect for our_country when Im leading than when other people have led it You will see that Russia will respect our_country more He shouldnt have done it I dont believe that he will be doing it more nowWe have to work something out but its not just Russia Take a look at whats_happened You dont report it the same way 22 million accounts were hacked in this country by China And thats because we have no defense Thats because were run by people that dont_know what theyre doingTRUMP Russia will have far greater respect for our_country when Im leading it and I believe and I_hope -- maybe it wont_happen its possible But I wont be giving (ph) a little reset button like Hillary Here press this piece of plastic A guy looked at her like what is she doing Theres_no reset button Were either going to get along or were not I_hope we get along but if we dont thats possible tooBut Russia and other countries -- and other countries including China which has taken total advantage of us economically totally advantage of us in the South China_Sea by building their massive fortress total Russia China Japan Mexico all countries will respect us far more far more_than they do under past administrationsI want to thank everybody So this is all -- just so you understand these papers -- because Im not sure that was explained properly But these papers are all just a piece of the many many companies that are being put into trust to be run by my two sons that I_hope at the end of eight years Ill come back and say oh you did a good job Otherwise if they do a bad job Ill say Youre firedGood-bye everybody Good-byeThere is a lot to unpack in this statement by the White_House spokeswoman part of an administration effort to deflect attention on the Trump campaign during the sprawling investigation_into Russian_meddling in the US election President Trump has also tweeted an article about the mysterious firm Fusion_GPS as he decried a witch_hunt by DemocratsIn other_words Russia was against Trump in the 2016 Election and why not I want strong military & low oil prices Witch Hunt Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) What is Fusion_GPS and do Sanderss claim hold water This is a complicated tale making it easy for the White_House to try to stir up a little fogIf this were a novel one mightsay it was not a credible plot twist that the same firm that helped inspire a salacious Russian dossier on the incoming president was also working on behalf of Russian-linked interests at the time But hey this is Washington While there are many lobbying or research firms with a certain ideological orientation some operate like law firms doing specific work on behalf of a client who hires itFusion GPS was started by a group of former Wall_Street Journal reporters notably investigative reporter Glenn R Simpson He co-wrote about how lobbyists and other Washington insiders were earning big fees representing former Soviet officials-turned-businessmen The firm it provides premium research strategic intelligence and due diligence services to corporations law firms and investors worldwide In other_words the ex-reporters have leveraged their reporting skills into a profit-making enterpriseHeres how Fusion ended up in the middle of the story Fusions many clients in recent_years included a law_firm and a Republican donor The donor concerned about the rise of Donald Trump wanted opposition_research on the businessman The law_firm Baker & Hotstetler needed help on litigation defending a Russia-owned company [ The Republican donor a conservative website financially supported by GOP megadonor Paul Singer]The Republican donor hired Fusion in September 2015 But once Trump won the Republican nomination the GOP_donor lost interest But in spring 2016 Fusion was able to persuade donors to Hillary_Clinton to keep funding the research [ The Washington_Post that the Clinton campaign and Democratic_National Committee funded the research]Fusion in June hired Christopher_Steele a former MI6 agent known for his contacts in Russia and Steele produced a series of salacious memos claiming the Kremlin had the goods to blackmail Trump which made its way to reporters members of Congress and the FBI The FBI considered Steeles work credible enough that it though the planned arrangement fell apart after the dossier became publicMeanwhile Fusion had been hired by Baker Hotstetler in early 2014 to assist on the defense against a civil action filed by the USgovernment alleging fraud by Prevezon Holdings In 2013 authoritiesaccused Prevezon of receiving proceeds of a scheme to and laundering the ill-gotten funds by buying real_estate in Manhattan Prevezon is owned by Denis Katsyv the son of a senior Russian_government officialHermitage Capital Management the alleged victim of the fraud is headed by William Browder once a top investor in Russia who had a falling out with the Russian_government Browder had hired Sergei Magnitsky a Russian tax accountant to investigate analleged theft from his Russian companies but Magnitsky was arrested and died in prison in 2009 under suspicious circumstances Browders advocacy of Magnitskys case led Congress to pass the 2012 Magnitsky_Act which bars Russian officials believed to be involved in the lawyers death from entering the United_States or using its banking system In response Russia blocked US parents from adopting Russian childrenSo two different clients two different deals for Fusion But then the story lines mergedSteeles work for Fusion centered on Trumps business_dealings in Russia And people working for Prevezon and opposed to the Magnitsky_Act met with Trump campaign officials at the Trump_Tower in June_2016 including Donald Trump Jr campaign_manager Paul_Manafort and Jared_Kushner the husband of Ivanka Trump Trump Jr agreed to meet with Natalia Veselnitskaya after an intermediary promised dirt on Clinton (The participants claim most of the discussions centered on the adoption ban imposed in response to the Magnitsky Act)Veselnitskaya was also working for Baker Hotstetler on the Prevezon case In_addition she sought to help Prevezon fan opposition against the Magnitsky sanctions Shortly after her meeting at Trump_Tower she attended a House Foreign_Affairs Committee hearing on Russian sanctions and a screening at the Newseum of a film attacking the Magnitsky_Act Another person at the Trump_Tower meeting was Rinat Akhmetshin who was once registeredas for a group called the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative which it wanted to help restart American adoption of Russian children Itwas housed in Denis Katsyv the owner of Prevezon was as one of the Russians who controlled the organization which no_longer seems to existSo what was Fusions work on the Prevezon case Prevezon soughtto turn the tables on Browder the governments main witness by arguingMagnitsky aidedhim in fraud rather_than exposing crimes So Fusion was tasked to find information to that Browder had told lawmakers and US government officials about the Magnitsky case according to statements the firm has made Simpson and his firm found records on Browders property and finances and tracked down potential witnesses Fusion Politico in December 2016 Fusion_GPS also discussed the case record with several reporters according to the statementInformation uncovered by Fusion as part of the litigation also became part of the anti-Magnitsky campaign In 2016 Browder with the Justice_Department accusing Fusion of failing to register as a lobbyist for a foreign interest under the Fusion said in that it complied with the law and worked for and under the supervision of an American law_firm to provide support for civil litigation in New_York and thus was not requiredto register under FARA In other_words the work product was for the litigation not anylobbying As far as we can determine there is littleevidence Fusion itself was involved in the anti-Magnitsky advocacy even if the fruits of its research may have aided foes of the Magnitsky lawBrowder suggeststhe timing of Fusions activities is questionableHe said Fusion contacted reporters between April and June_2016 when lobbying activity against the expansion of the Magnitsky law was in full swing The court case however was still pendingFARA is weakly enforced but two former Trump aides Manafort and former national_security adviser_Michael Flynn are under investigation for allegedly failing to comply with FARA So one can see the White_Houses interest in raising allegations of FARA fraud Whether Fusion should have registered for FARA is now While there is an exemption in FARA for certain legal work that exemption does_not apply to public relations workIn the end a federal appeals court in late 2016 Baker Hotstetler to end its representation because of a conflict of interest (a lawyer at the firm had previously represented Hermitage) That apparently also ended Fusions involvement Prevezon settled the case in May for $6 million with no admission of wrongdoing in what both_sides claimed was a victory (The United_States had sought to seize assets worth as much as $24 million) The competing claims were never litigated though NBC News in July raised by Prevezons defense teamWhew we told you it was complex Now lets look back at Sanderss statement The Democrat-linked firm Fusion_GPS actually took money from the Russian_government while it created the phony dossier thats been the basis for all of the Russia scandal fake newsAs we noted Fusions original client for the Trump opposition_research was said to have been a Republican Fusions client list is not public but critical news reports have cited Fusions work in 2015 and against We could find no record of political_contributions by Simpson though one of his partners Peter R Fristch made two $500 contributions to Hillary_Clinton campaign committees in 2016 according to Federal Election Commission records But that does_not necessarily mean the firm works only on behalf of Democrats or is Democrat-linked Obviously it would be helpful to learn who bankrolled the opposition_research on Trumps business dealingsMoreover there is no_evidence Fusion took money from the Russian_government It worked on behalf of an American law_firm which was hired by a company owned by a Russian whose father is a government official Even Browder a fierce critic of Fusion said in an_interview the White_House is conflating two issuesFinally Fusions hiring of Steele to produce the dossier was for a different client not the Russian_government US intelligence_agencies raised warnings about the Russian efforts to influence the election long before the dossier became public So the dossier is not the source of Russia scandal fake newsAmong its many clients Fusion had two with starkly different goalsOne client wanted dirt on Donald Trumps business deals especially in Russia which would be potentially damaging to Russias interests because US intelligence_agencies concludedRussia wantedto give Trump an edge in the electionAnother client wanted help in defending a lawsuit and Fusions research ended up aligning with Russias efforts to reverse US sanctionsIt may not look very pretty but this is Washington Hired guns work for whoever pays the billsIn any case Sanderss spinfalls flat There were Russian entitiesinvolved but there is currently no_evidence that the Russian_government paidfor Fusions work on the Prevezon defense at the same_time Fusion investigated Trumps business_dealings in Russia We will update this account if more information emerges during the Senate investigation of Fusion but for now she earns Three Pinocchios On Aug_10 President Trump uttered this claimAdditionally it seems that Russia spent a lot of money on that false report and that was Russian money and I_think it was Democrat money too You could say that was collusion That would be worthy of Four Pinocchios()Do you rate this claim as true or false More Pinocchios for false fewer based on your opinion of the statements truthfulness (The_check mark_means you think the statement is true not that you agree with the rating)We_need to verify that you are an actual_person This is a non-scientific_user poll_Results are not statistically_valid and cannot be assumed to reflect the views of Washington_Post users as a group or the general populationLast year the Pentagon lifted its long-standing ban on transgender men and women serving openly in the military At the time Defense_Secretary Ashton B Carter Our mission is to defend this country and we dont_want barriers unrelated to a persons qualification to serve preventing us from recruiting We have to have access to 100_percent of Americas population for our all-volunteer force to be able to recruit from among them the most highly qualifiedThat plan studied extensively was meant to be fully implemented by July 1This morning President Trump reversed that policyAfter consultation with my_Generals and military experts_please be advised that the United_States Government will not accept or allow Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Transgender_individuals to serve in any capacity in the US Military Our_military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous_medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail Thank_you Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) But would allowing transgender_people to serve_openly in the military create disruptionTheres no_evidence that thats trueEighteencountries allowtransgender personnel to serve_openly in the military includingAustralia Israel Britain Sweden and Canada None of these countries reported experiencing ill effects fromopening uptheir armed services to the transgender community They all said the same thing which is that inclusive policy has not in any way compromised military readiness And thats really important Palm Center director Aaron Belkin The Palm Center put out an extensive report on this issue in 2015In fact the US military studied how other countries tackled the change before drawing up its recommendationsby Rand_Corp which the Pentagon cited in its decision to lift the banlooked closely at four countries IsraelBritain Canada and Australia Researchers found that while there is limited research on the effects of transgender personnel serving openly in foreign militaries the available evidence indicated no significant effect on cohesion operational effectiveness or readinessIn fact they said that when they talked to British officers somereported that increases in diversity had led to increases in readiness and performance Interviews with these same commanders also found no effect on cohesion though there were some reports of resistance to the policy change within the general military population which led to a less-than-welcoming environment for transgender personnelOf course the specifics of integration lookdifferent depending on the country In most places transgender_troops must undergo hormone therapy or surgery before they can serve In Argentina transgender_service members arent required to undergo surgery or receive an expert opinion before officially changing their genderThe armed services inthe Netherlands Canada and Australia will pay for hormonal and surgical treatments but only after the service member receives approval from a doctorIn Britain individuals must live as their target gender for two years before they are granted legal recognitionIn Israel where military service is mandatory to support transgender recruitsDifferent countries offer different accommodations for service_members who transition once theyare already in the military In Britain theyre offered a new uniform at the start of the transition process along with new photos and ID cards bearing their new names A by the Royal Australian Air_Force (deemed the gold standard by experts) advises commanders to use common sense When it comes to questions about housing and bathrooms it suggests relatively intuitive solutions such as using shower curtainsand ensuring individual stalls are available when necessaryTransgender people are not barred from specific jobs in any of the services where they can serve_openly though they are often required to pass fitness tests for the gender they have transitioned toPresident Trump on Thursday condemned the violence by the anti-fascist protest movement known as antifa saying their tactics around the country have proved him right for denouncing bad actors on both_sides of the racially charged clashes with white_supremacists in Charlottesville last monthTrump said he explained his views on antifa to Sen Tim Scott (R-SC) during their private meeting at the White_House a day earlier Scott had expressed disgust with Trumps handling of the Charlottesville aftermathWe had a great talk yesterday Trump said during an on-record discussion with reporters on Air_Force One en route to Washington aftera trip to view hurricane-relief efforts in Naples Fla I_think especially in light of the advent of antifa if you look at whats_going on there you have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also and essentially thats what I said The president added that because of whats_happened since then with antifa when you look at really whats_happened since Charlottesville a lot of people are saying and people have actually written Gee Trump may have a point I said theres some very bad people on the other side alsoTrump faced widespread political backlash after he waited two days to specifically condemn the hate groups including the Ku_Klux Klan and neo-Nazis that organized the Unite the Right rally Violent clashes on the streets culminated in the death of a woman who was killed when a man participating in the rally plowed his car into a group of counterprotestersEven after denouncing the hate groups by name Trump within days mounted a defense of his initial response asserting there were very fine people among the marchers and suggesting both_sides were to blame for the violenceTrump said Scott presented legislation he was working on to help create jobs and put people to work which Trump said he supported Asked whether the senator had pressed him to add high-ranking African Americans to his White_House staff and administration Trump said We did talk about that yeah Its something I do and I certainly would continue to do We talked about that I told him I would do it and he knows weve already done it But I told him and I told him very strongly I like thatThe president was not specific about whom he might hire or when or for what positionsLater Thursday the White_House announced that Trump had signed legislation condemning the Charlottesville violence and hate groupsTrump issued a statement saying he was pleased to sign itAs Americans we condemn the recent violence in Charlottesville and oppose hatred bigotry and racism in all forms Trump saidNo matter the color of our skin or our ethnic heritage we all live under the same laws we all salute the same great flag and we are all made by the same almighty God We are a Nation founded on the truth that all of us are created equal As one people let us move_forward to rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as AmericansOn Sunday night The Washington_Post reported that President Trumps private business was in Russia in late 2015 only to abandon it shortly_before the 2016_presidential primaries The revelation adds a new layer of context to Trumps repeated insistence over the past_year that he has no business ties to the country suggesting that his avowed indifference toward making money in Russia was a function less of resolve than of circumstanceBroadly Trumps attitude toward business in Russia mirrors his behavior when it comes to Russian President_Vladimir Putin Before he was a political candidate Trump repeatedly said that he had a relationship with the Russian president (Among the examples he cited as evidence he knew Putin They were both on the same episode of 60 Minutes though Trump was filmed in the United_States and Putin in Russia) After that relationship became politically inconvenient his In the third presidential debate he responded to a question about Russian_interference in the election by saying I dont_know PutinAs we did with Trumps claims about knowing Putin in light of the most recent Post reporting its worth reviewing Trumps long history of seeking a business deal in Russia and his change

arrangementsI said I want ownership not leasesThey came up with a solution Mr Trump we form a committee with ten people of which seven are Russian and three are your representatives and all disputes will be resolved in this mannerI thought to myself [S] seven to three are we dealing in the world of the make-believe here or whatDespite that concern Trump warned of an imminent revolution in the country because premier Mikhail Gorbachev was too lenientI was very unimpressed with Russia he said Their system is a disaster What you will see there soon is a revolution the signs are all there with the demonstrations and picketing Russia is out of control and the leadership knows it Thats my problem with Gorbachev Not a firm enough handChina by contrast did it rightWhen the students poured into Tiananmen Square Trump explained the Chinese government almost blew it Then they were vicious they were horrible but they put it down with strength That shows you the power of strengthTrump a $250

Moscow and other places But we decided not to do itHe doesnt mention the project described by SaterDuring the second presidential debate the subject comes up againI know nothing about Russia I know about Russia but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia I dont deal there I have no businesses there I have no loans from Russia I have a very very great balance sheet So great that when I did the old post office on Pennsylvania Avenue the United_States government because of my balance sheet which they actually know very well chose me to do the old post office between the White_House

same_day four Trump_Organization trademarks in Russia With new revelations about Russian_interference in the 2016 election emerging Trump repeatedly denies any link to the countryRussia has never tried to use leverage_over me I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA NO DEALS NO LOANS NO NOTHING Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) I dont_know Putin have no deals in Russia and the haters are going crazy yet Obama can make a deal with Iran #1 in terror no problem Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Trump has his attorneys release a summary of his business_dealings with Russia[Y]our tax_returns do not reflect (1) any income of any type from Russian sources the letter (2) any debt owed by you or [The Trump_Organization (TTO)] to Russian lenders or any interest paid by you or TTO to Russian lenders (3) any equity investments by Russian persons or entities in entities controlled by you or TTO or (4) any equity or debt investments by you or TTO in Russian entitiesBut the first part of that paragraph is what seizes the publics imagination That lack of business_dealings holds true the lawyers say [w]ith few exceptionsThe exceptions are the sale of the house in Palm_Beach and the Miss_Universe pageant But that those were the only exceptions was not it seems for lack of tryingThe Trump White_House has tried to point the finger at the Obama_administration for its travails with retired Lt Gen Michael_Flynn whom the president fired as national_security adviser just three weeks after taking the oath of office Flynn was fired after The Washington_Post that he had misled other administration officials including Vice_President Pence about whether he had discussed pending sanctions with the Russian_ambassador during the presidential transitionFormer acting_attorney general Sally Yates testified May 8 that she had informed the White_House counsel on Jan 26 that Flynn was possibly compromised in his dealings with Russia because he had lied about the nature of the conversations But Trump took no action after The_Post revelations The White_House acknowledged that President_Barack Obama had warned Trump not to choose Flynn as national_security adviserSo what were the circumstances of his clearanceThe federal government is a very big place The White_House should not necessarily assume that political appointees know everything that is happening across the bureaucracy (Perhaps they have figured this out by now)In this case Flynns clearance was a routine matter said Jim Kudla a DIA spokesman Flynn had left the agency but the practice there is that all former DIA directors should keep a clearance so the current director is able to have a discussion with former directors about classified matters that might require insight from a previous directorFlynns clearance at DIA comes up for renewal every five_years and so in January 2016 he filed the necessary paperwork Kudla said the clearance was only for Defense_Department matters It was not so General Flynn could go to other agencies asking for classified_information he said Each agency would be required to determine_whether to allowaccess to classified materials Kudlanoted that at the time it was being renewed early in 2016 he was not in the political sphere he subsequently becameFlynn in February told CNN he had been advising Trump on a range of issues At one point Trump As part of the clearance renewal Kudla said an applicant is asked about foreign travel and foreign contacts Kudla said that there are a couple of questions about foreign financial interests such as stock investments but asking about payments for a foreign speech is not part of the clearance processSeparately he noted Flynn as a former Army officer is supposed to receive permission from the secretary of the Army and the secretary of state before accepting payments from foreign_governments Flynns lawyer has said that as part of the clearance review he disclosed his attendance at a 2015 event in Moscow organized by Russia Today a government-linked news organization that US consider to be a propaganda front But lawmakers when he did_not disclose $45000 that he received from appearing at the 2015 event and nearly $34000 from RTMost of the security clearance process deals with questions of character and trustworthiness (though it also includes consideration of possible foreign allegiance) said Steven Aftergood director of the project on government secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists It does_not address questions of competence or policy judgment He noted that in light of concerns about Russian election-tampering General Flynns record of interactions with Russian entities took on a new significance that they did_not have in 2015White House officials acknowledge that Flynn was still awaiting a CIA clearance when he was fired by Trump At the time he was fired Flynn had an interim clearance in order to allow him to do his jobI know what I went through as a political appointee twice in a Republican and a Democratic administration said James_R Clapper_Jr the former director of national intelligence in testimony on May 8 And the vetting process for either a political appointee or someone working in the White_House is far far more invasive and far far more thorough than a standard TS/SCI clearance process (TS/SCI refers to Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information the clearance level Flynn held at DIA)Flynns security clearance was a routine matter done mainly to benefit the head of the DIA and it did_not rise to a political level So Trump and other White_House officials are engaging in a distraction when they suggest that Obama failed to take action against FlynnObama actually fired Flynn because of perceived management flaws Its unclear exactly what Obama told Trump in private but that given the central role the national_security adviser has in coordinating US foreign_policy The concerns about Flynns dealings with Russia came only later after US intelligence realized he was discussing US sanctions with the Russians and then misleading other US officials about the nature of his conversations He also did_not disclose his payment from RT to government officials until after he was fired by Trump() Do_you rate this claim as true or false More Pinocchios for false fewer based on your opinion of the statements truthfulness

beneaththe Facebook postOthers online reported subsequent sightingsWe found another curled octopus yesterday evening on the beach near the lifeboat station Have these been seen by anyone elsePosted by on Sunday October 29 2017Graham Pierce a research scientist at Instituto de Investigaciones Marinas in Vigo Spain said the beached animals are most_likely curled octopuses which he said arecharacterized by a single row of suckers along the armsHe said there could be several reasons that they moved on to the beach including spawning weather andwater temperaturesJames Wright curator at the National Marine Aquarium in the United Kingdom and that the number of octopuses seen on the same beach at the same_time is quite oddBut them even being found in the intertidal is not common and suggests there is something wrong with them I am afraid he saidAs the areas where they are exhibiting this odd behavior coincides with the two areas hit by the two recent low-pressure depressions and associated storms of Ophelia and Brian it could be supposed that these have affected themIt could simply be injuries sustained by the rough weather itself or there could be a sensitivity to a change in atmospheric pressureVitaly Sych the editor of the Ukrainian weekly Novoye Vremya had readied a profile for only one candidate Hillary_Clinton to run once the results came in after what he called the most closely watched US election by Ukrainians of all timeThen came the bombshell that echoed all the way from the Potomac to the DnieperAMERICA PLAYS THE FOOL was the headline looming above a portrait of Donald Trump the next_day (Sychs colleagues talked him down from his first choice A boor an ignoramus and a racist Meet the new president of the United States)The major emotion here is anxiety and concern because he really said all those things so he must believe some of them Sych saidAmong those things he said He would befriend Russian President_Vladimir Putin who is not going into Ukraine and The people of Crimea from what Ive heard would rather be with Russia than where they were As to lifting US sanctions on Russia We would be looking at thatAnd then theres former Trump campaign_manager Paul_Manafort whose previous job was as political spin doctor for ousted and reviled Ukrainian President Viktor_Yanukovych now hiding in RussiaIf Russia was rooting for a Trump victory on election night it stands to reason who wasnt The big loser of the election is Ukraine tweeted Michael McFaul the former US ambassador to MoscowIn private some Ukrainian politicians agreed One lawmaker said the concern was a primal fear of losing support in the face of Russian aggression Pressed about Trumps statement on Crimea Oksana Syroyid a deputy chairman of Ukraines parliament said I resent that I_hope that since the campaign is over hell reconsider But one week after the election the truth is that nobody here in government wants to discuss the things Trump said about Ukraine Necessity in this case dictates thick skin and a timely bout of amnesia as Kiev looks to make its case to the president-elect and his Republican_Party Trump and President Petro Poroshenko spoke for the first time on Tuesday and Ukrainian officials optimistically are hoping to arrange a meeting between the two in New_York in February when Ukraine chairs the UN_Security CouncilI see it as a challenge with a plus said Victoria Voytsitska a member of parliament who is concerned about Ukraine sliding deeper into corruption and complained about doublespeak from current US officials I really think hell be straightforward They will demand real changes Unless he does that were doomedWishful thinking aside Ukrainian officials are looking to tamp anxiety about a Trump term Two years after the countrys Revolution of Dignity which toppled the Yanukovych government the country is looking to the United_States as a counterweight to neighboring Russia and as a source of aid and impetus for change in UkraineThere are two premises as to why not all is lost First is that the president-elect was exaggerating speaking ad hoc when he made statements during the campaign that dont reflect his real foreign policyI am certain that his ego will drive him to show who is in charge Voytsitska said The rhetoric about Russia I believe it was just to be different from the usual In reality he will start to show the muscles of the great countryAnd second is that a deep bench of hawkish Republicans would nudge Trumps foreign_policy toward Ukraine and away from Russia There is intense focus here on who will occupy key positions in the administration and questions about who will replace important players vis-a-vis Ukraine and Russia among them Vice_President Biden and the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs Victoria Nuland She has been handling talks with Russia over the Minsk agreements as they are called which instituted an often-violated cease-fire in breakaway regions of Eastern UkraineRepublicans are more pro-Ukraine than Democrats said a high-ranking Ukrainian official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the president-elect candidly And of course the Republicans are going to influence their candidateUkrainian officials like the names that have been floated for secretary of state Sen Bob Corker (R-Tenn) is known here for demanding that the United_States provide Ukraine with lethal aid (the Obama_administration has delivered tens of millions of dollars in nonlethal aid but has not provided weapons or munitions) John Bolton a former diplomat and leading Republican hawk raises appreciative eyebrows Former New_York mayor Rudolph W Giuliani is also viewed positivelyThe hometown favorite before he said Thursday that he would not be taking a position in Trumps Cabinet was Newt_Gingrich The former House speaker traveled to Kiev in September to meet Poroshenko and spoke at the Yalta European Strategy conference where he told attendees that Trumps policies if he were elected might differ from his campaign statements according to Trump shocked some people Sych said We thought it was Ukrainian tactics to first try and win the election campaign and then try to build your views and values because theres a lot of populists here Nobody thought that could be the case in the USUkrainian officials say their priorities now are to see US sanctions against Russia rolled over confirm the next tranche of US financial aid to Ukraine secure nonlethal assistance strengthen the military partnership between the two countries and also find a way to make a symbolic statement of allianceAlyona Getmanchuk director of the Institute of World Policy in Kiev said that officials were eager to establish good relations with Trump but were still testing channels of communication She was concerned that there will be less input from the West in terms of conducting reforms further reducing pressure on reluctant officialsOleksiy Melnyk the co-director for foreign relations and international security programs at the Kiev-based Razumkov Center said that Ukrainian officials were caught off-guard by the results of the election But he played down the potential now theoretical benefits of a Clinton victoryThe attempt to believe that the election of Hillary_Clinton would be a solution to the Ukraine conflict was very naive he said The good news is that we wont be disappointed There were too many expectations for herHuman rights groups asked a federal_judge Thursday to block President Trumps proposed ban on transgender_people serving in the military producing statements by three former Obama_administration US service branch chiefs and a senior Pentagon official that a ban would harm readiness staffing recruitment and moraleThe move to stop the Trump administration edict came two days after to Trumps ordering the Pentagon chief to determine how to implement the policyIn a statement Shannon Minter legal director for one of two gay rights organizations representing eight transgender US service_members said their opposition to the reckless ban was joined by military experts who know that ripping trained experienced service_members out of our armed_forces for no reason other than who they are will leave gaping holes in our defense compromise national_security and inhibit recruitment during a critical timeThe groups said they sought an injunction now because even_though Mattis has not taken action against current service_members as the Pentagon reviews its options he committed to carrying out the Trump policy by March 23 As a result service_members face the imminent prospect of being denied reenlistment promotions deployments and even medical care the groups saidMattis also suspended prior plans to permit new transgender enlistees threatening the careers of transgender students enrolled at the US Naval Academy or in the Reserve Officers Training Corps Minter said The filing in the lawsuit by Minters group the National Center for Lesbian Rights and GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) came in federal court in the nations capitalJustice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said We are examining the claims in the motion and conferring within the GovernmentUS District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly could issue a ruling or set a hearing next week Also Thursday the groups added two named individuals and one unnamed John Doe to five original plaintiffs identified by pseudonyms as Jane Does They include Regan Kibby a Naval Academy midshipman and Dylan Kohere an ROTC studentTheir participation at the academy and in ROTC is contingent on their eligibility to enlist in the military now in doubt they alleged Each said their initial decision to declare their transgender status was based on the Obama_administrations decision to allow their service in 2016A big part of the reason I was comfortable coming out as transgender in the ROTC was the announcement in the summer of 2016 that transgender_people would be able to serve_openly in the military Kohere said in an affidavit Kibby said he came out as transgender during his first year when the Obama announcement was made Kibby competed successfully for a congressional nomination and admission to the academy Kibbys enrollment was threatened in July when Trump caught many by surprise with tweets to countermand his predecessors actionAfter a lifetime of feeling a sense of duty and preparing to serve reading Trumps tweets was painful and I saw my future crumbling Kibby saidTrump on July 26 tweeted After consultation with my_Generals and military experts_please be advised that the United_States Government will not accept or allow Transgender_individuals to serve in any capacity in the US MilitaryHe elaborated Our_military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous_medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail The armed_forces were set to begin enlisting transgender_people July 1 but Mattis suspended that moveOur focus must always be on what is best for the militarys combat effectiveness leading to victory on the battlefield Mattis said To that end I will establish a panel of experts serving within the Departments of Defense and Homeland_Security to provide advice and recommendations on the implementation of the presidents directionBefore the Obama policy change the Pentagon had concluded that there was no basis for the military to exclude transgender_people as long as they could meet the same fitness requirements as other service_members The review examined medical care military readiness and other factorsThere is no official tally of transgender military members and estimates vary widely One recent study by the Rand_Corp put the number on active_duty at about 2500 while another from the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School estimated that there were 15500 on active_duty in the National Guard and in the reservesIn affidavits filed Thursday Obama Pentagon appointees Ray Mabus Jr Navy secretary from 2009 to 2017 Eric Fanning who held a series of posts from 2013 to 2017 ending as Army secretary and Deborah Lee James Air_Force secretary from 2013 to 2017 and Brad Carson acting undersecretary for personnel and readiness criticized the Trump proposalThe officials said the change would cause unexpected losses of skilled personnel in operational units that will be difficult to fill while reducing the size of the militarys recruiting poolPresident Trumps stated rationales for reversing the policy and banning military service by transgender_people make no sense said Mabus who oversaw the Navy and Marines through the surge in Afghanistan They have no basis in fact and are refuted by the comprehensive analysis of relevant data and informationUS military officials said Thursday that they suspect Russian hackers infiltrated an unclassified Pentagon e-mail system used by employees of the Joint_Chiefs of Staff the latest in a series of state-sponsored attacks on sensitive US government computer networksThe electronic intrusion was detected about July 25 officials said The Pentagon immediately disabled the e-mail system which is used by about 4000 military and civilian personnel in an attempt to contain the damage The network remains offline although officials said they hoped to restart it in the coming daysThe Defense_Department disclosed the attack shortly_after it occurred but only in recent_days have investigators traced it to Russia Officials said the complexity and advanced nature of the hack strongly suggested that a foreign government was responsibleThis attack was fairly sophisticated and has the indications of having come from a state actor such as Russia said a US official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the investigation The cyberattack on the Joint Staff which coordinates operations among the branches of the armed_forces is similar to one last fall that successfully penetrated unclassified e-mail systems at the White_House and the State_Department US officials said the trail also led to hackers thought to be working for the Russian_government Even so officials cautioned that it is difficult to pinpoint the origin or perpetrator of such hacks Attribution in this business is near impossible Rarely are you ever able to say with 100_percent certainty who was behind a particular incident the official saidThe incident follows several other more destructive cyberattacks on US government networks including devastating breaches of databases maintained by the Office of Personnel Management US officials believe hackers working for the Chinese government were responsible for those which exposedResponding to the spate of attacks officials in Washington have said they were working to bolster the security of computer systems across the federal government The disclosure of a successful breach of a Pentagon e-mail network however is likely to generate new scrutiny from Congress on the reliability of Washingtons cyberdefensesUS officials said the hackers penetrated the Joint Staff network with an old-fashioned technique known as spear-phishing which relies on unsuspecting e-mail users clicking on links infected with malwareRussias intelligence_agencies are also suspected of masterminding a successful attack on US military classified networks that was discovered in 2008 and took months to containThe Obama_administration the Russian or Chinese governments for the recent cyberattacks or offer hard evidence of their involvement reasoning that to do so could inadvertently reveal details about US cyberdefenses Moreover the US government operates its own cyberespionage campaigns against other countries so publicly pointing the finger at other countries could be seen as hypocriticalIn the recent attack on the Pentagon officials said that only unclassified e-mails were exposed and that the damage did_not appear to be significant They said the Joint Staffs classified networks were unaffected and are operating normallyWe continue to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks across our network and we continue to investigate this incident and our top priority is to restore services when we can said Navy Capt Jeff Davis a Pentagon spokesmanThere was no immediate reaction from Moscow In April Kremlin spokesman Dmitry_Peskov dismissed reports that the Russian_government was to blame for last years attack on the White_House e-mail network It has become a kind of sport to blame everything on Russia he said at the timeWashingtons allies in NATO have reported similar attacks however and have traced some intrusions back to shadowy groups with suspected ties to Russian intelligence servicesIn May for instance a computer network for Germanys lower house of Parliament was penetrated in a major hack German news_outlets reported that investigators thought that a Russian cyber-gang known as APT28 or Advanced Persistent Threat 28 was responsibleFireEye a US cybersecurity firm has scrutinized APT28 and suggested it has targeted

publication ofoutward facing documentsand news releasesraisingconcerns that the Trump administration was seeking to influencedistributionof their findingsDepartment officials scrambled to clarify the memo Tuesday afternoon after intense public scrutiny and media requests stating that the Agricultural Research_Service (ARS) had not blacked out public information and adding that scientific articles published through professional peer-reviewed journals have not been bannedSuch a decree would have conflicted with established scientific integrity standards and previous media guidance encouraging but not requiring USDA scientists to communicate with the media about their scientific findingsThe memos shortness and terse language seems to have exacerbated the confusion Starting immediately and until further notice ARSwill not release any public-facing documents This includes but is not limited to news releases photos fact sheets news feeds and social_media content wrote ARS chief Sharon Drumm in an email to employeesBy Tuesday_evening the guidance had been rescinded in a subsequent email Yesterday we sent an email message about Agency informational products like news releases and social_media contact another email to employees said This internal email was released prior to receiving official Departmental guidance and is hereby rescindedThe ARS guidance was not issued in coordination with other offices at the USDA department officials said and partially contradicted a department-wide memo that went out on the same_day The USDA-wide memo issued by the departments acting deputy administrator Michael Young was intended to offer guidance on interim procedures until a new secretary takes over USDAYoung stressed during a phone_call with reporters Tuesday_evening that his guidance does_not place a gag order on publication to scientific journals does_not place a blanket freeze on press releases or prohibit food safety announcementsThe ARS guidance was not reviewed by me I would not have put that kind of guidance out My guidance has to do with policy-related announcement and that sort of thing Young said during a phone_call with reporters early Tuesday_evening I had my memo drafted before the ARS memo I was not a part of itYoungs memo a copy of which was given to The Washington_Post emphasizes that press releases and policy statements must be routed through the office of the secretary for approval In order for the Department to deliver unified consistent messages its important for the Office of the Secretary to be consulted on media inquiries and proposed response to questions related to legislation budgets policy issues and regulations said the memo Policy-related statements should not be made to the press without notifying and consulting the Office of the Secretary That includes press releases and on and off the record conversationsYoung stressed that he is a career official not a partisan appointee and said that the memo he issued closely mirrored one sent at the beginning of the Obama_administration He also said he shared the memo with Trump transition official Sam_Clovis before issuing itThis is really just formalizing again what is fairly standard practice within the department I just felt like yeah I want to be cautious because I dont_want any surprises on my watch I was trying to avoid any surprises he saidThe Agricultural Research_Service employs thousands of in-house scientists maintains scores of research locations around the country and boasts a $1 billion budget It is tasked with conducting research to develop and transfer solutions to agricultural problems of high national priority according to the USDA That research focuses on topics such as food safety nutrition animal and crop production and agricultural sustainabilityResearch publicized on the USDAs website this month includes papers such as Helping Arizona Wheat Growers Maximize Resources and Test Uses Novel Antibodies to Detect Shiga ToxinsThe public-facing documents memo Monday which was first reported by BuzzFeed raised fears that the new Trump administration was attempting to filter articles about ongoing scientific research being conducted by ARSThe ARS sought to ease those concerns Tuesday afternoonYoung also said Tuesday_evening that he had spoken with ARS and suggested he might support clarifying or rescinding the research agencys confusing guidanceAs the US Department of Agricultures chief scientific in-house research agency ARS values and is committed to maintaining the free flow of information between our scientists and the American public as we strive to find solutions to agricultural problems affecting America ARS said in a statement to The_Post Tuesday afternoon seeking to clarify the scope of the memo USDA and ARS have issued media guidance in the past Under the Obama_administration guidance published in 2013 stipulated that USDA employees should clear any media inquiries on topics that are sensitive with public affairs staffers That media guidance which appeared to have been last updated in 2016 also urges them to communicate with supervisors about any instances where they feel public affairs or communications staff is stifling their ability to communicate about their workThe USDA does_not yet have a permanent department head Former Georgia governor

the Civil_War had turned his back on his own familys heritage by calling for the removal of Confederate_monuments The accusation drew swift condemnation from Democrats and some Republicans who said it amounted to calling Northam a race traitor In a two-part tweet on its official account posted shortly_after noon the state party took aim at Northam the Democratic_nominee for governor whose great-great-grandfather owned eight slaves in 1860 and nine slaves in 1850 on Virginias rural Eastern Shore @RalphNortham has turned his back on his own familys heritage in demanding monument removal

Republican_Party Was your account hackedFormer delegate David Ramadan a Republican tweeted Have you lost your minds who is in control of your twitter actAfter nearly four hours the state party pulled down the tweet and replaced it with this Our previous tweets were interpreted in a way we never intended We apologize and reiterate our denunciation of racism in all formsEric Boehlert a writer trolled the state Republican_Party by tweeting Its almost like yr trying to erase history when you deleted the tweets#monumentsJohn Findlay executive director of the state GOP said the party was not suggesting that Northam should stand with his ancestors as slave holdersWe said that Ralph_Northam is turning his back on his heritage and family It is because his great-grandfather fought for the side of the Confederacy and was wounded during the Civil_War Findlay said When he wants to tear down monuments dedicated to those killed in action and wounded during the war he is literally talking_about a member of his own familyFindlay noted a MassInc poll released Tuesday that found a slim majority of Virginia voters 51 percent want the statues to remain on public property while 28 percent would like them removed A majority 52 percent of voters polled also consider the monuments part of Southern heritage while just 25 percent believe the statues are symbols of racism A substantial majority of Virginians believe these monuments are not about hate but about history and we likewise share that opinion Findlay saidNortham called for the removal of the states Confederate_monuments after a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville on Aug 12 which had been called to protest the citys plan to remove a statue of Gen Robert_E Lee from a downtown park One woman was killed by a car driven by a man whom police described as a white supremacist and two state troopers patrolling the protest by air died when their helicopter crashed Gillespie who like Northam notes that localities control the fate of their monuments has said that his preference is to keep the statues but to add historical context The RPV was right to apologize for the tweet and to take it down Gillespie spokesman David Abrams wrote in an email Though Ed disagrees with the Lieutenant Governor on the issue of statues he knows we can disagree on issues like this without devolving into divisive rhetoricThe party tweeted about Northam after tangling on Twitter for days with former congressman Tom Perriello who in June lost the Democratic primary to Northam Perriello who grew up in Charlottesville tweeted after the rally to denounce hate groups and President Trumps equivocating response to the violent events He also turned his fire on Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr after the prominent evangelical leader praised Trump for his bold truthful stmt about #charlottesville tragedy The devil has his grip so firmly around @JerryFalwellJr that Im praying for his exorcism #Repent Perriello tweeted The former congressman also tweeted If you have a white pastor/priest who doesnt preach on white_supremacy as blasphemy against image of God in another please say something And White evangelical leaders your whiteness is the golden calf you choose to worship and idolize in blasphemy of Gods word #RepentNowThe GOP replied to the last of those with @tomperriello Lets not mince words you are a Christian-hating bigot We were better off when you were out of the country #LeftWingBigotPerriello who served overseas in the State_Department under President_Barack Obama later said he was not accusing all white evangelical leaders of racism only those who do not preach that white_supremacy is blasphemyIf they can produce a single Christian leader who agrees with their nonsense I am happy to sit down with them he told The Washington_Post Otherwise they should delete these tweets that insult Christianity and stoke hateDemocrats were quick

is becoming increasingly nasty with the statewide Democratic ticket sending out a new mailer linking Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed_Gillespie and President Trump to the torch-bearing white_nationalists who descended on Charlottesville over the summerIn August violent clashes between white_supremacists in Charlottesville rallying to defend a statue of Confederate General Robert_E Lee and counterprotestors left one woman dead and two state troopers died when their The mailer features images of both Republican men above a photo of the white_supremacists with the text On Tuesday November 7th Virginia Gets To Stand UpTo Hate The back of the literature features a prominent image of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ralph_Northam along with Democratic lieutenant governor nominee Justin Fairfax and Attorney_General Mark Herring with the message This is our chance to stand up to Trump Gillespie and hate All three Democrats approved the ad and the Democratic_Party of Virginia paid for the mailer But Gillespie has repeatedly condemned the white_nationalists behind the Charlottesville protest President Trump blamed for the violence and said there were very fine people on both_sides Gillespie has said there was no moral equivalency between the white_supremacists and counterprotesters and that he saw no fine people marching in Charlottesville but he stopped short of criticizing Trump as many Republicans and Democrats did Gillespies campaign condemned the mailer which was first reported by the Richmond Times-DispatchTo now see Ralph_Northam and the Democratic ticket exploit imagery from that tragic weekend to try to score political points is both outrageous and beneath the dignity of the offices they seek Gillespie campaign_manager Chris Leavitt said in a statement This is an ugly political attack that has no place in our Commonwealths political discourse Ralph_Northam should be ashamed to have approved such a hateful mail pieceNortham campaign spokesman David Turner countered that the mailer was fair because Gillespie did_not explicitly condemn the presidents response to the Charlottesville unrest Democrats pummeled Gillespie a former Republican_National Committee chairman for not joining members of his own party including Virginia US Reps Barbara Comstock and Scott W Taylor in directly criticizing Trumps reaction For 73 days Ed_Gillespie has refused to call out Donald Trumps response to Charlottesville for what it was disheartening and wrong said Turner When the Charlottesville community wanted leadership to help them heal he failed Ed_Gillespie should be willing to call out Donald Trump when hes wrong and because he wont he gives voters a clear choice on Nov 7Virginia politicians often pride themselves for the Virginia Way a concept that stresses civil discourse and setting aside partisan divide for the public good and for most of the campaign observers noted the genteel tone of the contest But in September Gillespie began airing ads that aimed to link to Northam while using images of Latinos in a way Latino groups call racist and inflammatory And another ad suggests Northam wanted to restore gun rights to violent felons Northam has also aired commercials blasting Gillespies record as lobbyist that claimed he lobbied for companies sending jobs overseas and companies trying to keep student loan rates high claims He seemed to lament the nasty tone of the campaign when speaking at a retirement community on Monday We have tried to be positive said Northam Virginians deserve civility especially after 2016Election Day is Nov 74chans /pol/ boards have for much of the 2016 campaign felt like an alternate reality one where a Donald Trump presidency was not only possible but inevitable At some point Tuesday_evening the boards Trump-loving racistmemers began to realize that they wereactually rightIm f trembling out of excitement brahs one 4channer wrote Tuesday nightadding a very excited Pepe the Frog drawing We actually elected a meme as presidentThe first threads for collecting examples of genuinely upset libtards and Hillary_Clinton supporters to meme mock and bombard them on Twitter began shortly_after that On 4chan a night that even a lot of 4channers thought would be a meltdown turned in a celebration filled with schadenfreude Internet-savvy racism and frogs4chan has over the course of Trumps ascendancy to president-elect watched in delighted astonishment as its little fringe of Internet life made its way repeatedly into the mainstream conversation of the elections This is after all the decade-old Internet forum whose beloved Pepe meme caused and a denunciationfrom the Clinton campaign in September because of its new popularity amongwhite-supremacist Trump backers The notorious message board has a long history of offending harassing or triggering its enemies mainly but not exclusively liberals minorities and establishment Republicans forits own amusement (ie lulz) The Trump movement was the perfectpathway for a wider audience of targetsThe 4chan vote was not the crucial voting block that swung the election to Trump but that sentiment the belief that 4chan had actually contributed to or straight up caused Trumps win was everywhere on the boards for most of the night Just hours earlier the boards were filled with much sadder Pepes and anxiety about thethen-positive results forClinton along with insults directed at the journalists who they knew expected to watch the there all day longAround 8 pm the chaos of ironic and genuine hand-wringing posts about /pol/ members and accusations of voter_fraud began to slowly give way to images of FloridaFlorida was a must-win state for Trump everyone had said and /pol/ documented every fluctuation there Soon though panicked images of a blue Florida gave way to red ones One thread filled up with hundreds of Pepes to help meme Florida over to Trump as if their energy could help Florida stay redWE WON THAT one thread began as Floridas red shade held HOW DO YOU FEEL GUYS B- IS GOING TO JAIL in reference to Clinton Wrote another 4channer Holy s I just cant believe (((they))) are allowing this Thetriple parenthesis are a racist meant to signify that someone is JewishDisbelief soon gave way to impatience and conspiracy for some Neither of them have reported on Florida being won by Trump both are reporting Hillary is in the lead I feel theyre holding off waiting for the Dems to meddle with the votesAnother encouraged those in states where voters were still at the polls to Use EVERY weapon in our meme arsenal to turn Blacks & Hispanics away from Hillary The post re-upped a bunch of4chans vote by text hoax images and various other anti-Clinton memes WHATEVER IT TAKES (legally) TO MAGA Push like your life depends on it (it does) SHARE AND MAGABy about 945 4chan had noticed that the New_York Timess real-time predictions on the elections outcome had suddenly started favoring Trump after starting off the day heavily favoring Clinton The board became a typically chaotic mess of celebrations threads urging meme magic for other swing states particularly Michigan Pennsylvania and Virginia and speculation about the Trump presidency that as the hours ticked on became all but certainI should be sleeping work tomorrow will be tough but the morning will be a glorious one one post readsThey discussed which mainstream or liberal news coverage was the best to watch for potential journalist freak-outs as Clintons path to victory disappeared (The consensus was The Young Turks although one 4channer speculated that if any mainstream journalists had handguns theyd be offing themselves right there on live tv) Brexiters joined in the celebrations and one 4channer rewrote a popular post from the boards celebration of Britains referendum to leave the European_Union to be about TrumpFinally by about 2 am the anxiety had disappeared from the boards as the calls handing Trump the presidency began to roll in By 230 a moderator had stickied this video to the top of the boardsAnd /pol/ reflected on how it good it felt to them to be rightToWhite House_Chief of Staff_John F_Kelly the conversation between the president of the United_States and the spouse of a fallen soldier is sacred And perhaps privateBut President Trump has been on the receiving end of significant criticism after Rep Frederica S Wilson (D-Fla) said hetold a pregnant widow thather husband who was killed in an ambush in Niger knew what he signed up for Trump denies he said those words which the lawmaker called insensitive to Myeshia JohnsonKelly said Thursday during the White_House news briefing that he was shocked that Wilson was even a part of the conversationIt stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation he said Thursday in the White_House briefing room It stuns me I thought at_least that was sacred Wilson being present for a conversation between the commander in chief and one of her grieving constituents doesnt make the call not sacred Neither does the fact that the mother of the fallen soldier who confirmed Wilsons report was present as wellPerhaps Kelly who also listened to the call would be less stunned if he realized that Wilsons primary identity to the Johnson family isnt as a member of Congress The Johnsons have known Wilson for decades most of those years before the former educator moved to Washington to join CongressWhen I saw the headline that a young man was killed in Niger from Carol City I thought My God please dont let it be a role model Wilson told Politico And it wasThe deceased soldier was an alumnus ofthe5000 Role Models of Excellence Project a mentoring program Wilson started for youths pursuing military careers among other fields So were his brothers One received a full scholarship to Bethune-Cookman University and the other is training to become a firefighterWilsons connection to the family goes back at_least one generation She CNN that she was the principal of a school that Johnsons father attendedThese relationships werepart of why Wilson was with the family not just because she was a member of CongressThe Washington_Posts Derek Hawkins about thisWilson was consoling his wife Myeshia Johnson when by her account Trump called and said that La_David Johnson knew what he signed up for but when it happens it hurts The president hascalledthe allegation andcriticizedWilsonWilson has a long track record oftaking on her constituents tragedies as her own helping people grieve and rallying her community in tough times especially those who come out of her program news archives showKelly explained in great detail how the military notifiesthe families of those who have lost a loved one on the battlefield Heseemed to bedescribing a situation similar towhat he went through himself whenheshared with The_Post in 2011 what it was like to get the news that his own son had died at war Heres what thenKelly would struggle to describe the pain he felt that day on his front porch It was disorienting almost debilitating he wrote in an email At the same_time my mind went through in detail every memory and image I had of Robert from the delivery room to the voice mail hed left a few_days before he died It was as graphic as if I was watching a videoIt really did seem like hours but was little more_than a second or soKelly composed himself and moved down his front steps to speak with Dunfords wife and walk his friends into the house [Gen Joseph F Dunford Jr a close friend had come toinform Kelly of his sons death] His wife Karen was still asleep I then did the most difficult thing Ive done in my_life Kelly said I walked upstairs woke Karen to the news and broke her heartKelly repeatedly stated during the briefing that those who have never had to endure what his family or the Johnson family have endured could never understand the pain they went throughBut for some Americans family is a broader concept that goes beyond the nuclear family often elevated in traditional circlesNo one would argue that Kelly is not qualified to talk about grieving a loved one But he also cant know who is privy to the Johnsons grief andwho was in their inner_circle in one of their saddest and most sacred momentsOn Thursday afternoon Anne T Donahue was partway through reading a about decades of sexual_harassment claims against Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein when she couldnt contain her outrage any longerI felt what I_think most women especially have felt that exhausted defeated feeling of when someone abuses power Donahue told The Washington_Post So I did what I do best when Im angry I went on TwitterThere she recounted in a pair of quick tweets her first experience with what she called her own Harvey Weinstein a then-boss at a radio station when Donahue was a 17-year-old high_school student The man had insisted on massaging her shoulders as she

examples in this story becausethey were postedpublicly on social_media and widely shared)Donahues original tweet has since been liked and retweeted thousands of timesAt some point several people began sharing their encounters with sexual_harassment in the workplace seemingly prompted by the New_York Times article using the hashtag#MyHarveyWeinstein tried to sexually assault me in chambers yet

(@AnnOlivarius) was Director at federal agency who demanded female employees accept his greeting kiss I was 21 and horrified PeteytheChi (@PeteytheChi) Donahue said she didnt expect the tidal wave of responses when she first tweeted about her radio station experience At first she tried to reply to everyone While the sheer volume of tweets quickly became unmanageable Donahue said she has been responding to all those who opened up about sexual_harassment in private messages with herIts an overwhelming feeling but in a way you feel in awe of everyone whos chosen to talk men and women It affects everybody It hurts everybody she said I didnt think this was going to be a campaign It was mostly me shouting into the abyssand voices came backSince the Times report broke Thursday Weinstein has said he would take an indefinite leave of absence from the Weinstein Company which he co-founded One-third of the companys all-male board quit and its remaining members said they were investigating the sexual_harassment allegations against Weinstein I appreciate the way Ive behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain and I sincerely apologize for it Weinstein said in a lengthy Though Im trying to do better I know I have a long way to goOn Saturday Weinsteins attorney as an adviser to Weinstein and addedwithout specifics that the Weinstein Company board was moving toward an agreementI have resigned as an advisor to Harvey WeinsteinMy understanding is that Mr Weinstein and his board are moving toward an agreement Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) The #MyHarveyWeinstein wave was reminiscent of the thousands of sexual abuse stories that poured forth online last October under the hashtag #NotOkay after a showed Donald Trump bragging on a hot mic about being able to kiss and touch women freely because he was a starGrab them by the py Trump says in the recording You can do anythingTrump initially defended his comments as before issuing a Though many thought the leaked tape would break the then-Republican presidential candidates campaign Trump would win the election the following monthShortly after the Access Hollywood video emerged Kelly Oxford a Canadian writer and social_media personality tweeted about her first sexual_assault then encouraged other women tofollow suitWomen tweet me your first assaults they arent just stats Ill go firstOld man on city bus grabs my pussy and smiles at me Im 12 kelly oxford (@kellyoxford) What followed Oxford was more_than a million women sharing their stories at her She estimated she was receiving 50 stories per minute at one point and called them harrowingOn Saturday Donahue said she had remembered the #NotOkay tweets from a year ago but said they werent why she had tweeted what she did Though she said her first experience with sexual_harassment came before she was 17 reading about the Weinstein allegations brought to mind her very specific encounters with the shoulder-rubbing boss because they reflected the same power imbalanceIt felt targeted she said He was a man in power who used power to make me feel powerless but would dangle the carrot of professional achievement in my faceDonahue said she felt lucky When she reported her bosss behavior people believed her Not everyone is she said in a guest column for the Toronto Globe and MailRape culture is everywhere It permeates our politics our entertainment our walks to school our job interviews our families our social circles We ask victims of harassment and assault what they were wearing before asking the perpetrator why they did it We ask how_much someones had to drink why they didnt quit toxic jobs or report creepy teachers or why they didnt rearrange their lives to escape the pattern they managed to get themselves intoWe remind the masses that boys will be boys or worse that real boys and men arent victims of harassment abuse and assault themselves pressured into silence at the hands of toxic masculinity that uses dangerous sexual norms to measure ones worth Rape culture doesnt discriminate It thrives on what we decide is normal reminding anyone whos suffered at the hands of it that they did something wrongDonahue said shehopes those who have experienced workplace sexual_harassment feel less alone when reading through the replies to her original tweet as well as others that have sprung up under #MyHarveyWeinsteinIt can feel very isolating when somethings happening to you she said I just lit the match Its everyone who responded who added to the fireJACKSON HOLE Wyo Federal_Reserve Chairwoman Janet L Yellen offered a forceful defense of broad new banking regulations enacted after the 2008 financial_crisis saying the rules safeguard the economy against another crisis and rejecting assertions from President Trump and top aides that they should be rolled backYellens speech delivered here to an annual gathering of central bankers finance ministers and economists comes as Trump considers whether to reappoint her to a four-year term as head of the US central bankYellen 71 made clear in her speech on Friday that she believes tighter regulations and standards have made the banking system safer and that while some improvements could be made they should be modest not structuralThe evidence shows that reforms since the crisis have made the financial system substantially safer Yellen said according to prepared remarks Trump has waffled on whether he would renominate Yellen to the post She was first nominated by President_Barack Obama for the four-year term after having served as president of the Federal_Reserve Bank of San Francisco Trump has said he likes her cautious approach to raising interest_rates but declaring her opposition to rolling back new banking rules could put a wide chasm between her and the White HouseThere are numerous banking regulators that have input in how the financial system is overseen but none are as powerful or as influential as the head of the FedYellens speech comes just hours after the Financial Times published an_interview with Gary Cohn Trumps top economic adviser in which he openly criticized the way Trump handled violence carried_out by neo Nazis and white_supremacists in CharlottesvilleCohn was also considered a front-runner for the Fed chairman post and the separate decisions by Cohn and Yellen to distance themselves from Trump could mean that neither is interested in cozying up to him as a way to try to get the nominationYellens speech reflected on the governments response to the Great RecessionA financial_crisis in 2008 and 2009 caused a global panic with some of the worlds largest financial companies wobbling or toppling and the US government injecting hundreds of billions of dollars into the financial system to prevent a collapse Large financial companies were interconnected and had amassed large amounts of risk without cushions to absorb losses or access to cash to prevent bank runsBanks and financial companies were chasing profits by making loans to people who lacked the ability to repay at times falsifying documents and betting on the false premise that the housing market would continue to soar As the banking system began to falter consumers panicked the stock market crashed hundreds of thousands of Americans lost their jobs and the US and many other economies went into recessionsIn 2008 the Bush administration and Congress passed a law that allowed the government to inject money into the banking system to try to arrest the crisis In 2010 the Obama_administration and Congress passed a law that imposed new consumer protection rules required banks to hold bigger cushions against losses put new limits on their ability to take risk tried to establish a process to help wind down large financial companiesTrump has said these changes went too far calling the law a disaster that has made it hard for consumers and businesses to access credit and restricted economic_growth One of his arguments supported by many banks is that requiring banks to hold more capital to cushion against losses makes it harder for them to lend moneyYellen addressed these criticisms head-on in her speech saying that research is mixed but that Fed officials believe there were sizable net benefits to economic_growth from higher capital standardsShe acknowledged though that some borrowers could see a decrease in access to loans because of the new rulesWhile material adverse effects of capital regulation on broad measures of lending are not readily apparent credit may be less available to some borrowers especially home buyers with less-than-perfect credit histories and perhaps small businesses she saidShe added that the Fed one of the nations bank regulators is taking steps to ease regulatory complexity that small banks face to help more small businesses obtain loansYellen did_not say in her speech whether she was interested in being appointed to another term She also didnt comment specifically on Trump or any conversations she has had with himThis may sound like Federal_Reserve fan fiction if such a thing exists but the best thing Fed Chair Janet L Yellen could do right_now might be to say that shell stay on even ifPresident Trump doesnt reappoint herShe could actually do thatFed chairs have the option to serve out a 10-year term as a Fed governor if they arent picked to lead the Fed again It has just never come up the past 40_years since theyve always been reappointed as long as theyre doing a good job and want to keep doing it Indeed President Ronald_Reagan kept Jimmy Carter-nominee Paul Volcker President Bill_Clinton kept Reagan-nominee Alan Greenspan and President_Barack Obama kept George_W Bush-nominee Benjamin S Bernanke Trump though really might not choose Yellen despite the fact that the unemployment rate is at a 16-year low and inflation is under its 2 percent target You like to make your own mark he Fox Businesss Lou Dobbs which is one of maybe the things shes got a little against her So is the fact that he seems to want someone who would take a lighter regulatory touch to Wall StreetNot all deregulators are created equal though Jay Powell the current Fed governor who is reportedly the might not be as tough on the big banks as Yellen would be considering his finance background but its not as though he would gut the post-crisis rules Not when he voted for them himself And just as important he has supported all of Yellens interest-rate decisions over the past few years Powell then would be the change candidate for the status quoBut the other finalist Stanford economist John Taylor would be another matter entirelyIts not just thathe would probably ease up on Wall Streetgiven that he thinks the government was for a lot of the bad decisions banks made in the run-up to the crisis a position that as Bloomberg Newss points out is borne out by the evidence Its also thathe has consistently called for higher interest_rates to fight inflation that isnt there and has never admitted their mistakes Insteadhe has concocted ever-more-elaborate theories easy money causes and is just about big government about whyhe was right to be wrongOf course its possible that Taylorwould change his tight-money tune now that a Republican is in the White_House In fact his supporters seem to be counting on that albeit put a little more politely (The Wall_Street Journal Editorial Page the unofficial organ of supply-side thought that Taylor wouldnt choke off a tax cut-fueled boom because he believes that faster economic_growth without inflation is possible and necessary)But you know its possible that they wouldnt in which case it would make a lot of sense for Yellen to stay at the Fed as a governorYellen wouldnt get to decide the Fed voted on anymore but she would still have a lot of influence on the Fed voted Thats because she has a lot of sway with the remaining members This admittedly is where we enter the realm of central banking fantasy Since 1993 Fed governors have dissented only from what the Fed has decided Even when they might harbor some private doubts they tend to be very deferential to the Fed chair But if someone like Taylor was appointed and Yellen did stay we could end up with a situation where there were three Fed governors Yellen Powell and Lael Brainard deeply at odds with a Fed chair who wanted to raise rates much more_than they did Add in New_York Fed President Bill Dudley and San Francisco Fed President John Williams both of whom have generally agreed with Yellen and will be voting members next year and they might even have a majority Itd be enough to make say Fed Chair John Taylor either compromise quite a bit or else see himself become Fed chair in name onlyThis would be radical but these are radical times Dont let the 42 percent unemployment rate fool you For the past 30_years it has taken lower and lower interest_rates just to produce lower and lower growth Putting someone who doesnt understand that in charge of the Fed risks leaving millions of people worse off than they should be After all the low-unemployment economy that Yellen has helped to happen is finally giving working-class families their after accounting for inflation since the end of the Clinton administrationThats worth fighting for even if central bankers dont usually fight this
