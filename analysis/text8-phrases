 For the first time we have a figure from the 2016 Trump campaign who we know is cooperating with special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III in his Russia investigation George_Papadopoulos is talkingExactly what that means we dont really knowBut thats just one of several big juicy questions emanating from The document is filled with anonymous campaign officials on the other end of Papadopouloss emails We now know who a few of them are thanks to but a few big ones are still unknown In many cases aides seem to have known about contacts with Russia that the campaign and its principals including President Trump would later denyBelow are four big questions we have in light of and three that have been answeredAt the very end the indictment says Papadopoulos was arrested at Dulles International Airport in suburban Washington on July 27 of this year It says he has talked with the governmenton numerous occasions to provide information and answer questionsItis suspected that the special_counsel is trying to flip Paul_Manafort and get him to cooperate via his own indictment Papadopoulos was far less central to the campaign but here we actually have someone who is cooperatingWhat did he agree to share in his plea deal And what does he even to share This may be the biggest question of allThe indictment says Papadopoulos attended a national_security meeting about March 31 with Trump and other foreign_policy advisers for the campaignIt saysPapadopoulos told the group that he had connections and could arrange a Trump-Putin meetingThe text doesnt technically saywhether Trump was present when this claim was made But if he was it would render Trumps own denials of his campaigns contactwith Russia pretty dishonestThe campaign and the White_House have The denials even came from Trump himself and Vice_President Pence But this particular set of emails (and more to come below) suggests that several members of the campaign were aware of contacts discussing a desire on behalf of the Russian_government to broker a meetingWhite House_press secretary_Sarah Huckabee_Sanders said Monday she was not sure that the president recalls specific details of the meetingThis is yet_another high-level aide who would have known there was contact with Russia Papadopoulos told this adviser on April 25 that these governments tend to speak a bit more openly in neutral cities playing up his own stationing in LondonIt may be neither here nor there in this whole sequence but Papadopoulos seems to have believed at one point that the unnamed London professor introduced him to Putins_niece identifying her as such in an email to the campaignHe later says it wasnt actually Putins nieceBut who was it And did Papadopoulos not seek to verify this information Or was he trying to inflate his connections in the email Its all very strangeAnd below are the questions The_Post has been able to answerAfter a March 24 2016 meeting with the unnamed London professor and an unnamed Russian national whom Papadopoulos at one point believed to be Vladimir Putins_niece Papadopoulos_emailed a campaign supervisor and several members of the campaigns foreign_policy team according to the document He told them the meeting was to set_up another meeting between the campaign and Russian leadership to discuss US-Russia ties under President TrumpThe campaign supervisor at this point replied Great workLater about June 1 Papadopoulos_emailed the same supervisor to say that a Russian MFA wanted to set_up a meeting between Trump and Putin The supervisor urged Papadopoulos to make the trip with another foreign_policy adviser insteadIn a tantalizing footnote someone described as a high-ranking official on the Trump campaign forwarded a Papadopoulos email to another official in late May and said We_need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips It should be someone low_level in the campaign so as not to send any signalSo yet again we have a top official in the campaign who was aware of Papadopoulosscontacts with Russia Papadopoulos titled the email Request from Russia and thought it through enough to offer a different course of action Along with the supervisor and members of the foreign_policy team above thats another apparently high-ranking Trump campaign official who knew about this How could the campaign and White_House go on to deny such contactsAlso juicy here What does so as not to send any signal mean Some see that as a potential tell when it comes to a larger effort to coordinate with the Russians which is the big unanswered question in this whole investigation But it could also simply be that they didnt want to telegraph a close alliance with Russia which could have been politically problematicThis is a different high-ranking official from the one mentioned above But its another person who apparently knew based on multiple emails about what the campaign and White_House would later denyThe 18th and 19th of each month were busy days at the Woori bank branch in the Kaesong industrial complexSalaries for the 54000 North_Koreans who worked in the interKorean economic_zone on the northern side of the demilitarized zone that separates the estranged countries were due by the 20thSo the managers of the 123 South_Korean companies operating there would head to the Woori branch a couple of days before to withdraw cash Always in US dollars and usually in $100 or $50 notesEvery month the accountant would tally the hours of each worker and each worker would check their hours and sign a list said Ok Sung-seok head of Nine Mode a clothing company that hired 300 North_Koreans until The manager of the factory would go to the Woori branch in Kaesong and take out the money in US dollars Ok said The cost for hiring each worker was between $180 and $200 a monthThen with the cash in an Woori bank paper bag the company representative would drive five minutes down the road to a management office and hand over the cash to the North_Korean officials thereFor more_than a decade South_Korean companies have been handing over bags of greenbacks to the North_Korean regime in this wayWhen it was opened in 2004 the idea was that the Kaesong industrial complex would help lessen the economic gap_between North and South and at the same_time expose a few isolated North_Koreans to the outside_world The government theory went that these benefits outweighed concerns about what the north might do with the moneyBut now that has all changedPark Geun-hye the South_Korean president has acted with unusual decisiveness and acted alone following her gut instinct advisers say to in the wake of North_Koreas nuclear and missile_tests and with it the sunshine_policy era of engagementShes the president The buck stops with her said a senior government official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberationsIn an address last_week that the money South_Korea was sending through Kaesong was helping the runaway Kim_Jong Un regime This echoes what critics of the project had been saying for a decadeSouth Koreas government estimates that it has sent more_than half a billion dollars to North_Korea through Kaesong over the past 12 years including $120 million last_year alone By the time it closed this month 54000 North_Koreans were working in 124 Southern-owned factories in the zone making an average of about $160 a monthThey did_not receive any of the money instead being paid in vouchers that they could use in local stores No ones knows what proportion of the monthly payment each worker received but the Daily NK a South_Korean website with sources inside the North or about $30The $560 million sent through Kaesong was in addition to the $487 million it sent through the Kumgangsan tourist resort in the years it was open according to unification ministry statistics and the $22 billion in fertilizer rice and disaster assistance from South to North since the mid-1990sParks decision to end the last major engagement project with North_Korea was the result not just of North_Koreas actions but also of ChinasIn the three years since she took_office Park has made concerted efforts to woo China including risking annoying Washington by attending a military extravaganza in Beijing last_year Yet after North_Korea conducted its nuclear_test at the beginning of January Chinese President_Xi Jinping refused to take a phone_call from Park for a month according to multiple people with knowledge of the situation When they finally talked the Chinese leader didnt say anything that hadnt already been said in the official media anything that couldnt have been said the day of the test said one person who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversationsParks decision to close Kaesong and also to open discussions with the United_States about hosting an that China staunchly opposes is meant as a signal that South_Korea will do everything it can to punish North_Korea and it expects other countries to do what they can analysts sayChina which shares a long border with North_Korea is by far its largest trading partner and therefore has the most leverage over its errant neighborThe Kaesong complex was shut_down once before by North_Korea which withdrew its workers during a period of heightened tensions in 2013 But experts think that this time the closure is permanentRealistically its closed for good said Lee Jong-seok who was South_Koreas minister of unification during the sunshine_policy years and remains a strong proponent of engagement Now that the South_Korean government has alleged that the money is going into North_Koreas nuclear program theres no way they can reopen thisPark had tried to find a middle ground between the sunshine_policy and the hard-line tendencies of her predecessor pursuing what she called a trustpolitik approach to North_Korea a combination of carrots and sticks But the nuclear_test and missile_launch forced her to call an end to this approachShes come to realize that trustpolitik doesnt work said Chun Yung-woo national_security adviser to Parks predecessor and an advocate of a much tougher approach to the North Shes now decided to speak the language that North_Korea understands the language of sanctions and regime change Yoonjung_Seo contributed to this reportAfter the historic ouster of on Friday scandal-weary South Koreans began turning their attention to a new election due within 60days and to the prospect that her successor could try to reset relations with neighboring North_Korea and its powerful patron China In the three months since Park was suspended over corruption allegations plunging the country into limbo amid protracted impeachment proceedings the regime in North_Korea has launched five and is accused of of the leaders half brotherAdd to that Chinas anger over the deployment of a US to South_Korea and uncertainty about President Trumps administration in Washington and the lack of leadership in South_Korea could hardly have come at a more sensitive time A political vacuum like this in a key ally that borders a major nuclear threat is not good for the US said John Delury an American political scientist in Seoul I_think its been underestimated as a danger and as a destabilizing factorSecretary of State Rex Tillerson will encounter this problem firsthand when he arrives in Seoul next week for discussions about North_Korea with a South_Korean counterpart who is on his way out Tillerson will also hear about the rise of a progressive candidate whose approach toward China and North_Korea could differ sharply from that of the impeached president and from the stance of the United StatesThe Trump administration is conducting a policy review to decide how to deal with North_Koreas threats and there is plenty of talk in Washington about kinetic options a euphemism for some kind of military action Meanwhile in Tokyo some ruling-party lawmakers are openly pushing for Japan to develop the capacity to preemptively strike North KoreaThat is the kind of talk that South_Korea should be shutting down Delury said In_addition to its nuclear and missile_programs North_Korea has conventional artillery lined up along the demilitarized zone and aimed_at Seoul a metropolis of 25million peopleThe role of a South_Korean president whether liberal or conservative is to be the person who gently takes that option off the table Delury said referring to a preemptive strike The South_Korean president has to be saying If you take out their missile pad they take out our capital But that hasnt been happeningPark was immediately dismissed from office Friday after South_Koreas Constitutional_Court upheld a legislative impeachment motion ruling unanimously that she had continuously broken the law Elections will be held in early May and the latest opinion polls show Moon Jae-in a progressive who unsuccessfully challenged Park for the presidency in 2012 holding a strong leadMoon favors the sunshine_policy of engagement with North_Korea the liberal idea from the late 1990s that engagement can help open up the closed state and narrow the gap_between the two KoreasThis sunshine_policy ended in 2008 with the election of a conservative president who took a tough approach toward North_Korea a stance maintained by ParkFollowing North_Koreas nuclear_test at the beginning of last_year Parks government that was the linchpin of the sunshine_policy accusing the North of using South_Korean cash from economic engagement projects to bankroll its weapons programsMoon however has said he would like to resume engagement with North_Korea and would go to Pyongyang for talks with its leaderIf Moon wins the general election he will emphasize South_Koreas alliance with the US and a strong defense posture said Lee Chung-min a professor of international relations at Yonsei University But his heart will lie in fostering deeper engagement with the North and negotiating an early summit with Kim_Jong UnMoon has also signaled an openness to reviewing the Park governments agreement to host the United_States Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defense_(THAAD) antimissile_battery The agreement was reached last_year to protect against North_Korean missiles and the system was due to arrive in South_Korea this summer But in a surprise announcement the Pentagon said the first shipment arrived in South_Korea on MondayThis has sparked widespread speculation in South_Korea that the United_States expected Park to be impeached and wanted to make the deployment more difficult to reverse The US military command in South_Korea said the deployment was being carried_out according to scheduleChina has vehemently objected to the arrival of THAAD in the region viewing the deployment as a US attempt to keep China not just North_Korea in check To prod Seoul to change its mind Beijing has imposed painful restrictions on South_Korean imports ranging from toilet seats to pop musicWe are all very clear that the crux of the problem between China and South_Korea is that South_Korea is ignoring Chinas concerns and is deploying the THAAD antimissile_system with the United_States Chinese Foreign_Ministry spokesman_Geng Shuang said FridayWe once again urge South_Korea to focus on the interests of the Chinese and Korean people he saidBut analysts say that even if the progressive Moon becomes South_Koreas next president he will face difficulties in backtracking on THAAD or returning to the sunshine policyWhile China might expect a U-turn over THAAD if Moon becomes president it will be extremely difficult for Moon to do that since THAAD is being placed primarily for the defense of the United_States forces in Korea said Lee the Yonsei professor Despite Moons inclination to oppose THAAD_deployment he will not undo it at the expense of worsening ties with Trump just as Moon begins his term in office Lee saidLikewise it would be difficult to go back to the kind of sunshine_policy of previous liberal presidents said Robert Kelly of Pusan National University I dont_think there is much support for major engagement any more he saidThis is partly because public opinion has changed dramatically thanks to two North_Korean attacks in 2010 that left more_than 50 South Koreans dead as well as the Park governments assertion that engagement money was funding weapons developmentI think Moon would have to fight hard to get that kind of engagement off the ground hed be pushing against the Americans and against his own people Kelly saidBut for South Koreans who wanted Park out there is a sense of opportunityToday is just the beginning said Kim Kyoung a housewife who attended every rally against the impeached president and returned to central Seoul on Friday night to celebrate Parks departure South_Korea developed very quickly but now we have an opportunity to move slowly and help our democracy mature Congcong_Zhang in Beijing contributed to this reportOnthe brand-new political news website the headlines could have been ripped from a speech by President Trump Immigrants commit more crime Syrian refugees are raping girls and Muslim education is taking over the school system But the two-month-old Gatestone Europe website is based in the Netherlands the contributors are Dutch And their aim their editor says is to swing the debate ahead of European elections this year to deliver a tide of anti-immigrant leaders to office in the Netherlands France Germany and elsewhereWebsites that focus on the perils of open borders immigration and international alliancesare expanding in scope and ambition in Europe seeing a once-in-a-generation opportunity to harness the energy from Trumps win to drive deep into a continent where traditional political parties are struggling Some of the websites are registered in Russia Others like Gatestone Europe are being supported by Americans with ties to TrumpIn the Netherlands someonline activists are backing a handful of anti-Muslim candidates including the fiery Geert Wilders who is running in a dead heat against the ruling party ahead of March15 elections In France news blogs are spreading innuendo about the rivals of the anti-immigrant Marine Le_Pen who is the most popular presidential_candidate in the lead-up to the election in April and May And in Germany some ofthe outlets have spread false stories about refugees raping people that were repeated by the Russian foreign_minister Fed by public anger about refugees the Muslim-bashing Alternative for Germany party is poised to seize seats in Germanys Parliament in SeptemberTheres quite a lot of news quite shocking often with rape or violence and immigrants said Timon Dias 29 who started Gatestone Europe last_month after several years of writing for a different anti-establishmentwebsite in the Netherlands We want people to learn whats_happening in Europe and vote accordingly especially ahead of elections this yearAlthough many of the sites are small the Amsterdam-based Gatestone Europe has only four writers and no office they do not need to be well established to score big on Facebook or Twitter A spicy individual post can go viral with little regard for the history of the outletIts a crowbar in the system Dias said The main line is highly vigilant highly critical about what the effects are of having a significant Muslim minority in the inner cities The project is funded by the New York-based Gatestone Institute which is chaired by former UN ambassador John Bolton who was a finalist in Trumps search for a new national_security adviserContacted for comment the Gatestone Institute made available one of its board members retired Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz who said that the organization is nonpartisan and that its aim is tomove the debate to the center Bolton did_not reply to a request for commentAs with other similar sites many of Gatestones posts are based on true events spun aggressively to feed the narrative that mainstream pro-European Union politicians are selling out their countries to immigrants The site does_not support any one candidate in the Dutch elections but the anti-EU leader of the small Forum for Democracy party Thierry Baudet is a contributorWe report the news to our readers in a directed way Dias saidAlthough Wilders is likely to face trouble forming a coalition and Le_Pen is forecast to lose the second round of Frances presidential_election both candidates have had success in shifting debate in their nations onto more anti-immigrant Euroskeptic ground Far-right websites are often their megaphoneIn the Netherlands similar news outlets have already made successful forays into Dutch political lifeA referendum last_year on whether the Dutch government should ratify a trade deal with Ukraine was triggered by a far-right news site GeenStijlThe eventual rejection of the trade deal turned into an embarrassing defeat for the Dutch government which was forced to backpedal on its commitment to Ukraine Opponents of the trade deal including GeenStijl cited an opposition to EU expansion and a desire not to antagonize the Kremlin as reasons to vote it downPro-Ukraine-deal campaigners say they suspect that the Kremlin put a finger on the scale by supporting activists and pro-Russian trolls online although no link has been proved The activists including GeenStijl deny any connectionBut even absent ties to Russia the news sites demonstrated a powerful ability to disrupt the pro-EU agenda of the Dutch mainstream creating a political headache for Dutch leaders and feeding Western disunity that coincides with Kremlin effortsThe Ukraine referendum has shown what kind of mayhem they can cause said Cas Mudde a Dutch scholar of far-right movements at the University of Georgia What impressed a lot of people was their ability to mobilize people who were commenting on websites to go out and actually vote for a cause People werent expecting thatNow GeenStijls political arm GeenPeil Dutch for no poll has spun off into a political party and is contesting the parliamentary election on the promise to hold Dutch leaders accountableUntil my generation everybody had a better life than their parents That has stopped said Jan Dijkgraaf 54 a former journalist who is now the leader of GeenPeilHe said he did_not consider himself a far-right politician but he seized on immigration as a major focus for Dutch votersDijkgraaf said he could understand if a mother of three needed temporary refuge from war But when there are boys of 25 with these kind of muscles you have to think are they really victims of a war or do they have plans to get rich or to do something like in Brussels or in ParisThe Ukraine referendum sparked a number of political parties most of which have struggled to break through Wilderss lock on anti-immigrant discourse in the NetherlandsWilders was using Twitter to spark outrage and publicity long before Trump turned to electoral politics A tweet last_month of a leading political opponent Alexander Pechtold Photoshopped into a pro-sharia demonstration in London dominated political coverage for days Wilders later acknowledged that the photo was fake but said Pechtold had recently been to a similar demonstrationThey dont care about what is really true what is a little true or what is fake Pechtold said And thats of course what we have seen in the United StatesIn the far-right Web universe the faked picture caused no uproarIts a way of speaking to people said Bert Brussen editor of ThePostOnline another far-right website where headlines on recent articles have included Iraqis on Trial for Gang Rape in Vienna and Massacre by Islamic terror was again prevented in GermanyA lot of what Wilders says its Internet language Brussen said The Internet makes them stronger and they make the Internet strongerIn other countries with elections this year far-right sites are also thriving attracting the attention of some of the American outlets that helped propel Trump to victory Last year Breitbart_News whose former head Stephen_K Bannon is now Trumps chief_strategist said that it would take the plunge into the French and German markets although there is so_far little sign that it is readying to openBut anti-establishment activists in those countries may need little helpIn France where far-right candidate Le_Pen wants to take a hard line against Muslim immigration hold a referendum on EU membership and embrace relations with the Kremlin far-right news sites have taken aim at whichever candidate appears most likely to challenge her in the final round of the presidential_election due to be held May 7 (Le Pen is expected to win the first round)For months that was center-right candidate Franois Fillon More recently a surge from the centrist Emmanuel Macronhas drawn a volley of darts from rumor-mongering websites some of them branches of Russian state_media Macron recently took on the rumors joking that his apparent ability tohave gay affairs puzzled his wife who is usually by his sideAnd in Germany and Austria experts say roughly 30 German-language alternative websites are currently operating Many have existed for years butthey have transformed into machines to undermine traditional politicians especially since the start of Europes refugee crisisThe majority of them experts say tend to have opaque ownership structures making it difficult to ascertain who is behind them They are almost universally pro-Russian in tone and some of the German-language sites areoperated from Russian servers though direct links to the Russian_government are hard to findThey publish stories with a true core building their own atmosphere around this core what we call hybrid fake said Andre Wolf a spokesman for Mimikama an Austria-based fact-checking websiteMany stories seem aimed_at undermining German Chancellor_Angela Merkels bid for reelection on Sept24 But as a center-left challenger Martin Schulz rose in the polls in recent_weeks along surged a flurry of fake reports including one by the website AnonymousNewsru falsely claiming that his father once ran a Nazi concentration campAcross Europe Dias said the possibility of change is alivePeople feel the epicness of

to colleagues Monday that he is stepping down amid a series of indictments that cast a shadow on work his firm had done with Paul_Manafort that may have benefited a Ukrainian regime friendly to the Kremlin The Podesta_Group is not named in the newly released indictments but the company is one of two indirectly referenced in the charges Podesta and another lobbying firm Mercury Public Affairs were working with Manafort and his partner_Rick Gates from 2012-2014 in lobbying to improve the image of the Ukrainian government In the indictment the firms are referred to as Company_A and Company_B according to people_familiar with the companies involvementManafort and Gates turned themselves in to federal authorities Monday while facing a 12-count_indictment on various charges including misleading the government about their secret work for a foreign government Later in the day Podesta announced his resignation at a staff meeting at the Podesta Groups Washington headquartersIt is impossible to run a public affairs firm while you are under attack by Fox_News and the right wing media he told his former employees according to a person_familiar with his remarks Podesta is the brother of John_Podesta a longtime Democratic adviser who led the presidential campaign of Hillary_Clinton The resignation of one of Washingtons most prominent Democratic lobbyists shows how the investigation of special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III is reverberating throughout both partiesIts unclear how_much the Podesta_Group or its principal founder knew about the funding for the client they represented The Podesta_Group and Mercury claimed in lobbying disclosure reports that they represented a Brussels-based nonprofit the European Center for a Modern Ukraine that sought to help Ukraine improve its image in the West from 2012 to 2014 However behind the scenes the lobbying work was being directed by Manafort and Gates prosecutors allege Their real client was the government of Ukraine the indictment says Gates and Manafort for many years represented the Party of Regions a Russia-friendly political organization in Ukraine that was led by Viktor_Yanukovych former president of the Ukraine In 2012 Manafort and Gates solicited two Washington DC firms (Company A and Company B) to lobby in the US on behalf of Yanukovych and the Party of Regions and the Government of Ukraine The Podesta_Group fully disclosed its representation of the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine and complied with federal disclosure laws by filing under the lobbying disclosure act over five_years ago said Molly Levinson a spokeswoman for the firm in a statement The Podesta_Group has fully cooperated with the Special Counsels office and taken every possible step to provide documentation that confirms compliance with the law Based on our due diligence and on the recommendation of definitive legal experts the firm filed the appropriate public disclosures of its representation of the ECFMU over five_years ago and in eight subsequent public filings The Podesta Groups work for ECFMU a nonprofit was in support of Ukraines admission to the EU a position supported by foreign_policy experts at the time The ECFMU provided formal certification that it was neither funded by nor directed by a government or political party A Mercury partner Michael McKeon issued a statement Monday afternoon acknowledging the firms representation of the Center Mercury worked for the ECFMU with the intention of aligning Ukraine with western democracies generally McKeon wrote Mercury retained a lawyer to determine the proper method of disclosure of such representation and followed the advice he said noting that the company has previously filed under lobbying and foreign-agents disclosure laws Mercury takes its obligations to follow all laws rules and regulations very seriously Mercury has and will_continue to fully cooperate with the Office of the Special Counsel he wrote While claiming that the European Center for a Modern Ukraine was the client that organization was actually under the ultimate direction of the Government of Ukraine Yanukovych and the Party of Regions the indictment said Company_A and Company_B were paid for their services not by their nominal client the Centre but solely through off-shore accounts associated with the Manafort-Gates entitiesThe Podesta_Group and Mercury came into focus for prosecutors as they delved deeply into Manaforts finances earlier_this yearThe way the South_Korean government tells it North_Korea is on the brink of collapse A collapse in no small part being brought about by the tough actions of the South_Korean governmentBarely a week goes by without a report of cracks in Kim_Jong Uns_regime This weeks report concerns the alleged execution of a vice premier and the banishment of two other senior officialsA spokesman for South_Koreas Unification Ministry said Wednesday that Kim Yong Jin who served_as North_Koreas education minister and then as a deputy prime_minister Why and when Inappropriate to say on both counts he saidBut Seoul confirmed his execution through various channels said the spokesman Jeong Joon-hee South_Korean reports suggested that the vice premier was branded an anti-party and anti-revolutionary element and killed by firing squad in July after not standing upright at a meeting of the Supreme Peoples AssemblyAt the same_time Jeong said that Kim Yong Chul a hard-liner in charge of inter-Korean relations and Choi Hui vice chief of the propaganda and agitation department were sent to the countryside for reeducationThis was the latest installment in Seouls narrative that Kim_Jong Uns grip is weakeningPrevious chapters include the recent defection of the deputy North_Korean ambassador in London because he was sick and tired of the system and reports that a North_Korean official based in Southeast Asia and tasked with making money for the leadership had defected with bags of cash Add to that the mass defection of 13 workers from a North_Korean restaurant in China This all conveniently comes after President Park Geun-hyes administration in Seoul took surprisingly harsh steps to punish Pyongyang for its January nuclear_test in particular then supporting tough international sanctionsThe South_Korean president has been quick to draw a line linking all these events saying last_week that serious cracks were appearing in North_Korea and that elite defections could be a sign that the system is shakingBut South_Korean intelligence has a record of being right as often as it is wrong a early this year showed up at a party congress in May and of being used for political purposesSome analysts wonder whether thats what is happening nowI think its clear that when it suits the South_Korean governments purposes information is shared with the media said Scott A Snyder a Korea expert_at the Council on Foreign_Relations So how reflective are these reports of whats_happening in North_Korea We dont always knowAlmost since the establishment of North_Korea as a Soviet client state 70 years_ago government officials and analysts have been predicting its imminent demiseWhile most analysts agree that sudden changes such as the latest ones probably reflect stresses within North_Koreas senior ranks there is wide variation in interpretation Some say executions and purges are a sign of instability but others say they are a sign of strength because Kim_Jong Un is consolidating his leadershipThe regime probably does face some pressures but the overall internal trajectory over the past three or four years has been one of consolidation and efforts to impose even higher tests of loyalty Snyder said Id say it was a sign of instability if disloyalty went unpunished Totalitarian states like the one that Kim_Jong Un inherited retain control through a reign of terror using executions and purges to keep the elite in line and more general repression and limits on information to keep the wider society under controlThe current leaders father Kim_Jong Il executed more_than 2000 officials between 1994 and 2000 said Cheong Seong-chang a respected North Korea-watcher at the Sejong Institute outside SeoulKim Jong_Un has had about 130 officials put to death since he took over the helm of the country from his father almost five_years ago according to a tally by South_Koreas Yonhap_News AgencyNotable among those executed are Kims own uncle Jang Sung Thaek put to death in 2013 for apparently amassing too_much power and wealth and the Kim Yong-hyun professor in North_Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul said that some shake-up was to be expected after Kim_Jong Un held a Workers_Party Congress in May the first since 1980A wide reshuffling of the North_Korean elite has taken place as part of the process of building Kim_Jong Uns system he said adding that the execution could have served_as a warning to others in North_Koreas top tierWhile high-level defections are embarrassing for Pyongyang and officials running off with money meant for the leadership will inflict some pain neither presents an existential threat for North_Korea said Christopher Green a North_Korea researcher at Leiden University in the NetherlandsAs with so many things about North_Korea the present picture will be clear only with hindsight There could be cracks in the regime and it could be about to collapse but the thing is no one actually knows Green said Yoonjung_Seo in Seoul contributed to this reportXandra Lammers lives on an island in Amsterdam the back door of her modern and spacious four-bedroom house opening onto a graceful canal where ducks swans and canoes glide byThe translation business she and her_husband run from their home is thriving The neighborhood is booming with luxury homes going up as fast as workers can build them a quietly efficient tramway to speed residents to work in the world-renowned city center and parks bike paths art galleries beaches and cafes all within a short ambleBy outward appearances Lammers is living the Dutch dream But in the 60-year-olds telling she has been dropped into the middle of a nightmare one in which Western civilization is under assault from the Muslim immigrants who have become her neighborsThe influx has been too_much The borders should close said Lammers soft-spoken with pale blue eyes and brown hair that frames a deceptively serene-looking face If this continues our culture will cease to existTo Europes powers that be the threat looks dramatically different but no less grave If enough voters agree with Lammers and support the far right in elections here on Wednesday and then its modern Europe itself defined by cooperation openness and multicultural pluralism that could come crashing down The stakes have risen sharply as Europeans anti-establishment anger has swelled In interviews across the Netherlands in recent_days far-right voters expressed stridently nationalist anti-immigrant views that were long considered fringe but that have now entered the Dutch mainstreamVoters young and old rich and poor urban and rural said they would back the Geert Wilders-led Freedom_Party no_longer the preserve of the left-behinds which promises to solve the countrys problems by shutting borders closing mosques and helping to dismantle the European UnionTheyve found a very powerful narrative said Koen Damhuis a researcher at the European University Institute who studies the far right By creating a master conflict of the national versus the foreign theyre able to attract support from all elements of societyAlong the way Europes old assurances have been swept aside The far right may exist the continents political establishment has long told itself but a virtuous brew of growing economic prosperity increased cross-border integration and rising education levels would blunt its appeal Most important all the pungent memory of the nationalist rights last turn in power would keep it from ever gaining control in Europe againBut in 2017 every one of those assumptions is being challenged perhaps even explodedAfter the transatlantic jolts of and Donald Trump last_year continental Europe is bracing for a possible string of paradigm-rattling firsts in its postwar history In France has a credible shot at a triumph in spring presidential elections In Germany appears poised to win seats in the national parliament this fall And here in the Netherlands a man convicted only months_ago of hate speech could wind up on top when votes are counted in next weeks national electionsAt first glance the Netherlands a small nation of 17million that has long punched above its weight on the global stage through seafaring exploration and trade seems an unlikely setting for a populist revoltUnlike in France where the economy continues to stagger nearly a decade on from the global financial crisis the indicators in the Netherlands are broadly positive falling unemployment healthy growth and relatively low inequality By most measures the Dutch are some of the happiest people on EarthAnd unlike Germany where Chancellor_Angela Merkel opened the countrys borders to a historic influx of refugees in 2015 the Netherlands has been relatively insulated from mass immigration Compared with its neighbors the Dutch took significantly fewer asylum seekers during the refugee crisis and much of the countrys nonnative population settled in the Netherlands decades agoThose differences make it all the more surprising that the far rights message resonates here and hint at just how difficult it could be to halt the global populist waveFor much of the past two years Wilderss Freedom_Party has led the polls though it has recently dropped into a virtual tie with the ruling center rightBecause of the deeply fragmented nature of Dutch politics there will be 28 parties on the ballot Wednesday the Freedom_Party could come out on top with just 20percent of the vote Even if it does it is considered extremely unlikely that Wilders would end up governing because other parties have spurned himBut he has already had an outsize influence forcing rival politicians including the prime_minister Mark Rutte to shift their policies and rhetoric in his directionTo many Wilders supporters the overall picture of a growing economy with a comparatively small number of recent immigrants is beside the point Their reasons for backing the platinum-haired politician who refers to Moroccans as scum and advocates a total ban on Muslim immigration run much deeperThe main issue is identity said Joost Niemller a journalist and author who has written extensively on Wilders and is sympathetic to his cause People feel theyre losing their Dutch identity and Dutch society The neighborhoods are changing Immigrants are coming in And they cant say anything about it because theyll be called racist So they feel helpless Because they feel helpless they get angryAnd today that anger can be found far beyond the poorer less-educated working-class areas where Wilders and his party first gained substantial supportI hear it on the tennis court and at the golf club People dont_want immigrants said Geert Tomlow a former Freedom_Party candidate who fell out with Wilders but still sympathizes with many of his positions One-third of Holland is angry Were angry We dont_want all these changesThat is true even in places where little seems to have changedTeunis Den Hertog a 34-year-old small-business owner lives in a pastoral town that he said is virtually untouched by immigration Ive heard theres a Turkish man who lives here but just outside the town thankfully he saidNonetheless Den Hertog said he wants the government to close the country to new arrivals and reestablish compulsory border checks for the first time in decadesYou can see a vehicle coming with a lot of men with dark skin and pick them out said Den Hertog who grew up poor and one of nine children but now earns enough to afford a comfortable suburban-style house for his family of four Otherwise its just too dangerousDen Hertog said he typically avoids the countrys diverse cosmopolitan cities But Wilders supporters exist there too as Lammers the Amsterdam island resident can attest University-educated financially successful and raised in the culturally progressive firmament of the Netherlands biggest city Lammers had long staked her ground on the left Her father was a regional mayor from the Labour Party and she identified as a supporter well into adulthoodI was very politically correct she said I believed in the social experimentIt was a move up the social ladder that precipitated her shift across the political spectrumIn 2005 she and her_husband bought their home in the Amsterdam neighborhood of IJburg an innovative development built on a cluster of artificial islandsLike many who moved to the neighborhood Lammers and her_husband did so because the area offered bigger houses at lower prices than could be found in the crammed city center And at first it was everything they had hopedIt had a village feeling Everyone knew each other They put a temporary supermarket in a tent she recalled It was cozyBut then came a surprise Families of Moroccan and Turkish origin started moving in part of a social program to dedicate 30percent of the developments housing to people on low incomes the disabled or the elderlySuddenly she said white Dutch residents had to share their streets gardens and elevators with Muslim women wearing headscarves and men sporting beards Crime noise and litter soon intruded on her urban idyll she saidThe newcomers generally spoke Dutch and many seemed to work But she faulted them for not integrating the evidence of which she said could be found in their traditional dress and attendance at a modest storefront mosqueShe suggested they try church instead though Lammers said she does_not attend (Sometimes on Sunday I watch American church on the television Lammers said Theyre very opposed to Islam I like that)If the newcomers have hurt her neighborhoods desirability its not apparent in the home prices which have sharply risen Nor is it visible on the streets which are clean tidy and on a mild late winters day filled with children of various ethnic backgrounds happily riding scooters and bikes But Lammers remains bitterYou think youre going to live in a well-to-do neighborhood she said But you end up living in a so-called black neighborhood because of the socialist ideologyAmong the beneficiaries of that ideology is one of Lammerss friends Ronald Meulendijks a 44-year-old who has been living on full-time medical disability since he was 29The government pays him the equivalent of $1000 a month and provides him with a steep discount on a light-filled three-bedroom apartment in the heart of IJburg benefits he said he deserves as a native-born Dutchman with a long pedigreeMy whole family of seven generations paid taxes he saidMuslim immigrants and their children by contrast are undeserving he saidWhen I see all the refugees getting everything for free I get very angry I want to throw something at the television said Meulendijks who dotes on his pair of chow-chow rescue dogs and serves visitors to his art-filled apartment copious tea and strawberry pie A government has to treat its own people correctly before accepting new ones First you must take care of your ownAnd if the government fails Meulendijks has dark visions of whats to comeI think Holland will need a civil_war he said between the people who dont belong here and the real peopleTo drive home the point Meulendijks has decorated his panoramic windows with five large posters bearing the face of Wilders and his partys campaign slogan The Netherlands is ours againA pronounced nick in the glass the result of a carefully aimed rock suggests not everyone in the neighborhood agrees with Meulendijkss clash-of-civilizations worldviewNeighbors said they did_not recognize the grim vision of IJburg that Lammers and Meulendijks describedWhich country you come from or which religion you have it doesnt matter here said Iris Scheppingen 41 a resident for the past decade who is raising three children in IJburg The children all play togetherAt a nearby halal pizza restaurant one of the neighborhoods few businesses that explicitly cater to Muslim customers the owner said the area was safe and quiet He said he had never noticed a cultural clashNice people here said 49-year-old Farhad Salimi as his staff of young kitchen workers slung pies and sprinkled toppings Everyone comes here for pizza Immigrants Dutch people Everybody We dont have problemsThe world however was a different storyA refugee from Iran who moved to the Netherlands nearly 30_years ago Salimi said he had seen what religious zealotry and the politics of exclusion did to his native landNow the gray-haired Salimi fears it is happening across the West even in the peaceful and prosperous country that had so enthusiastically welcomed himThe politicians are exploiting divisions turning people against one another for their own gain he said Extremism is rising Where will it endEverywhere he said solemnly is messed up Karla_Adam in London contributed to this reportAs Donald Trump surged in the Republican primary polls in the early months of 2016 his outsider campaign faced growing pressure to show that the former reality-TV star and noted provocateur was forming a coherent and credible world view So when Carter_Page an international businessman with an office near Trump_Tower volunteered his services former officials recall Trump aides were quick to make him feel welcomeHe had come with a referral from the son-in-law of Richard Nixon New_York state Republican Party Chairman Ed Cox who had conveyed Pages interest to the campaign Cox saidA top Trump adviser Sam_Clovis then employed what campaign aides now acknowledge was their go-to vetting process a quick Google search to check out the newcomer He seemed to have the right qualifications according to former campaign officials head of an energy investment firm business degree from New_York University doctorate from the University of LondonPage was in He joined a new Trump campaign national_security advisory group and in late March_2016 the candidate pointed to Page among others as evidence of a foreign_policy team with gravitasBut what the Google search had not shown was that Page had been on the FBIs radar since at_least 2013 when Russian officials allegedly tried to use him to get information about the energy businessBy the summer of 2016 Page who had been recently named as a Trump adviser was under surveillance by FBI agents who suspected that he may have been acting as an agent of the KremlinAs part of its broader investigation_into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian_government the FBI continues to examine how Page joined the campaign and what conversations he may have had with Russian officials about the effort to interfere with the election with or without the knowledge of Trump and his team according to people_familiar with the matterThe Senate_Intelligence Committee has also zeroed in on Page asking him for records of all his contacts with Russians during the campaign all financial interactions he had with Russia and all communications he had with Trump campaign staffThe circumstances that led to Pages easy access to the Trump campaign represent one of the main questions facing investigators Were Trumps connections to multiple Russia-friendly advisers mere coincidence or evidence of a coordinated attempt to collude with a foreign government Or were they the result of incompetent vetting that left a neophyte candidate vulnerable to influence from people with nefarious agendasRegardless of the answer the campaigns previously unreported procedures for vetting Page and other advisers are greatly complicating matters for Trumps presidency Along with Page a number of other Trump associates are under growing scrutiny by congressional investigators and the FBI as they examine potential ties between the campaign and Moscow including former national_security adviser_Michael Flynn onetime campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort and informal Trump adviser Roger StoneThis week former CIA_director John Brennan told the House_Intelligence Committee that in 2016 he had seen intelligence revealing contacts and interactions between Russian officials and US persons involved in the Trump campaign that I was concerned about because of known Russian efforts to suborn such individuals He did_not name the individuals but said that when he stepped down as CIA_director on Jan 20 he had unresolved questions about whether the Russians had been successful in getting campaign associates to work on their behalf in a witting or unwitting fashionMultiple people_familiar with campaign operations most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations said that Page and others were brought into the fold at a time of desperation for the Trump team As Trump was starting to win primaries he was under increasing pressure to show that he had a legitimate presidential-caliber national_security team The problem he faced was that most mainstream national_security experts wanted nothing to do with himEveryone did their best but there was not as much vetting as there could have been former campaign_manager Corey_Lewandowski saidAnother longtime campaign official put it this way Anyone who came to us with a pulse a rsum and seemed legit would be welcomedWe were not exactly making due diligence the highest priority another campaign veteran addedA White_House spokeswoman referred questions to Trumps campaign Michael Glassner who currently serves as manager of Trumps campaign committee declined to commentPage and Trump aides have said that Page never met Trump and Page left the campaign in August 2016 Page has denied working on behalf of the Russians and said questions about his Moscow ties are part of a political witch_hunt designed by Democrats to discredit TrumpPage has for months declined to answer_questions about how he joined the Trump team and who invited him aboard calling the matter irrelevant in an email exchange with The Washington PostIn a letter to Deputy Attorney_General Rod J Rosenstein last_week Page wrote that he had been an informal unpaid member of one of [Trumps] campaign committeesIn his defense Page in recent_weeks has sent a series of meandering letters to investigators He has quoted Maroon5 lyrics cited the writings of George Orwell and said he is being persecuted because of his Catholic faithIn a letter sent Wednesday to the House_Intelligence Committee Page referred to himself as an unpaid informal member of the Make America Great Again movement a reference to Trumps campaign slogan and said he had been illegitimately swept up into this investigation based on false evidence and propagandaPages entry to the campaign came as Trump was starting to win Republican primaries and take commanding leads in GOP polls but was also facing criticism for his lack of foreign_policy advisersIn early March_2016 more_than 70 conservative national_security experts signed an open letter opposing Trumps candidacy calling him fundamentally dishonest Trump announced that then-Sen Jeff_Sessions (R-Ala) the only senator supporting him would chair a foreign_policy panel for the campaign but no other members of the panel were named publiclyWhen the hosts of MSNBCs Morning Joe pressed Trump on air in mid-March to name people with whom he spoke about foreign affairs the candidates response only seemed to underscore his lack of serious adviceIm speaking with myself number one because I have a very good brain he saidAs the campaign maneuvered behind the scenes to expand its ranks Page had at_least one built-in advantage when he joined the Trump campaign geographic proximityHe ran a company Global Energy Capital LLC with offices located a block from Trump_Tower and connected by an atrium to the famed propertySome campaign veterans speculated that Page may have stepped forward on his own essentially walking into campaign headquarters and introducing himself without a referral a frequent occurrence at Trump_Tower in those early daysLast week Page rejected this version of events Wrong again he told The_Post via text message At least one other primary person(s) involvedOn Thursday after Cox described his role Page confirmed that the New_York GOP chairman had connected him to the Trump campaignCox said in an interview that Page an acquaintance from business and political circles had reached out to him in early 2016 expressing interest in joining the Trump campaign Cox said he routinely connected potential volunteers with GOP campaigns He described Page as very informed and up to date on thingsSeveral former officials recall that when Page first showed up at Trump_Tower Lewandowski introduced him to other campaign aides Lewandowski said he could not remember the encounter which was first reported by the Daily Caller but also did_not rule it outClovis who assembled and vetted the list of national_security advisers that included Page declined to comment Now a top official at the Agriculture Department Clovis had worked on Russia-related issues at the Pentagon in the 1980s and as a candidate for US Senate in Iowa in 2014 had questioned the effectiveness of sanctions_imposed after Russias incursion into UkraineRepresentatives for Flynn Sessions and Jared_Kushner Trumps senior adviser declined to comment A White_House official said senior policy_adviser Stephen Miller also a key campaign staffer at the time had no role in the formation of the foreign_policy groupA thorough vetting of Page might have revealed several red flags Page had spent three years working in Moscow for instance and he held stock in the Russian company Gazprom meaning that he could have a personal financial stake in the future of US-imposed sanctions against RussiaPage wrote in a September letter to then-FBI Director_James B_Comey that he had sold his de minimis equity investment in the Russian company at a loss a month earlierPage had previously drawn the attention of the FBI after he had conversations in 2013 with a man posing as an executive with the New_York branch of the Russian development bank Vnesheconombank The man was later convicted of being a Russian spy and FBI recordings included discussions among Russian operatives about their attempts to recruit Page Page has said that he cooperated with the FBI and that the only crime related to the incident is that US government officials appear to have recently revealed his role to the mediaBy late March_2016 when Trump appeared before The Posts editorial board he was prepared to brag about his new foreign_policy teamI can give you some of the names Trump said after Post Publisher Frederick J Ryan Jr asked about his advisersSecond on the list of five read aloud by Trump Carter_Page PhDAnother unusual name on Trumps list of foreign_policy experts was a little-known figure named George_Papadopoulos whose inclusion may also have demonstrated the vulnerabilities that came with limited vettingHes an energy consultant Trump said Excellent guyThe news media soon reported that Papadopoulos seemed to have exaggerated elements of his rsum And touting his position as a Trump adviser Papadopoulos began offering positive comments about Russian President_Vladimir Putin to foreign audiencesPapadopoulos did_not respond to requests for comment His name had surfaced four months earlier on a similar list of foreign_policy advisers circulated by the presidential campaign of Ben CarsonBarry Bennett who served_as Carsons campaign_manager and later as an adviser to Trump recalled that he was surprised when Trump named Papadopoulos to his teamHe was someone who worked for me at the Carson campaign for like 15 minutes And somehow he was on the list Bennett said of his reaction to the Trump roster I was like how in the hell did that happenTrump soon added a few names to the group and held a formal briefing with its members in a conference room at his not-yet-opened hotel in Washington A photo of that session distributed by Trump on social_media meeting with my national_security team Trump wrote showed the candidate at the head of the table and Sessions at the opposite endPapadopoulos could be seen at the table Page was not there and Trump officials have said that Trump never met Page during his five-month stint as an adviser People involved with the campaign recall that Page attended other meetings that the group held in Washington including one attended by Sessions He also submitted policy memos for the campaigns review a former campaign adviser saidIn June Page stunned a group of foreign_policy luminaries during a private meeting at Blair House with the visiting prime_minister of India by going off-topic to declare that Putin was a stronger and more reliable leader than President_Barack Obama according to people who were in the room Page also promised that US-Russian relations would improve if Trump were elected Page has denied this account blaming it on his political enemiesThe next month Page delivered a speech at a Russian university in which he was highly critical of US policy Page has said he met with no Russian_government officials during the trip except for briefly greeting a deputy prime_minister who attended the eventOver the summer the FBI convinced a Foreign_Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable_cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of Russia law_enforcement and other US officials Pages name also appeared in a now-famous dossier which quietly circulated among reporters and alleged that there were links_between Trump associates and the Kremlin The document asserted that Page met with top Russian officials to plot how to elect TrumpThe document which was compiled by a former_British spy employed by Trumps political adversaries became public after the election and was dismissed by Trump and his allies as fake_news Page vigorously rejects the allegation about him and said the FBI should spend its time investigating how the document came together instead of his activitiesPage used his Wednesday letter to the House_Intelligence Committee to defend his contacts with the Russians Presenting the letter as a follow-up to Brennans testimony Page wrote that throughout my interactions with the Russians in 2016 I consistently made it crystal clear that all of my benign statements and harmless actions in Moscow as well as elsewhere overseas were solely made as a scholar and a business person speaking only on behalf of myself In other words in no way connected to then-candidate TrumpEarlier this month Page insisted in writing to the Senate_Intelligence Committee that for all the attention he has received he did_not once meet TrumpIn retrospect and with the 1984-inspired governance standards employed in 2016 Page wrote I consider it fortunate that I never briefed Mr Trump Devlin Barrett and Alice_Crites contributed to this

residents of this fish-and-chips enclave in the land of flamenco pamper their simian neighbors with meticulous care and feedingYet even as the colony of apes tailless monkeys really thrives in its home at the top of the Rock the 30000 Britons who live at the foot of the soaring limestone monolith are feeling nervousThey may not be going anywhere But thanks to Brexit Gibraltar is about to leave the European_Union giving Spain new impetus in its centuries-long quest to retake control of this strategically vital and economically prosperous territory Britains sole continental outpostTo the residents who take their Britishness seriously Spains suggestions that Gibraltar could be cut_off from the rest of Europe unless it accepts at_least partial Spanish sovereignty represent a serious threatGibraltar they say embodies the European ideal of shared prosperity through cross-border trade and movement But as European bonds fray those living here worry that the coupling of Brexit with Spanish threats could return Gibraltar to a painful pastInstead of feeding the goose that lays the golden egg Spain is trying to kill it said Ernest Tito Vallejo Smith a retired military man local historian and tour guide We dont_know whats going to happen Were stuck in limboIn that respect Gibraltar has company Since to exit the EU the country has been locked in suspended animation awaiting the outcome of negotiations that will reshape virtually every aspect of its relationship with its European neighborsAs Gibraltars predicament shows untangling Britain from the EU will not be easy With the negotiations expected to begin this spring British Prime_Minister Theresa May has vowed that she will deliver results to a population demanding liberation from the Brussels bureaucracy and in particular greater freedom to limit migration into BritainBut she also will have to defend British financial interests which are heavily intertwined with the EU And she will need to look out for each of the United Kingdoms component parts some of which Scotland Northern Ireland and Gibraltar voted against BrexitMeanwhile European negotiators will seek to use every bit of leverage to drive a hard bargain with their soon-to-be-former EU ally and to dissuade other wavering members from a rush to the exitsThe negotiations due to last two years could leave tiny Gibraltar especially vulnerable Its residents know this well and it helps to explain why 96percent of Gibraltarians who voted in the June referendum opted for remainUnlike its rainy island motherland some 1000 miles to the north sun-splashed Gibraltar relies on daily movement and trade across a European border to supply nearly half of its workforce and the vast majority of its resources And the country that controls that border is Spain which gave Gibraltar away to Britain in a peace treaty more_than 300 years_ago and has wanted it back ever sinceWith the Brexit vote Spanish officials seemed to think their moment had finally come Within hours of the result then-Foreign Minister Jos Garca-Margallo declared that the time to plant the Spanish flag on the Rock was close at handLast fall Spain took its case to the United_Nations arguing that Britains hold on Gibraltar represented an outdated relic of colonialismSpains position has slightly softened in recent_weeks with the countrys new foreign_minister acknowledging that Spain has little hope of regaining control as long as the British government and Gibraltar authorities refuse to budge But he also suggested that there will be consequences to Gibraltarians for a spurned Spanish offer of co-sovereigntyThey have a right to get left out of the EU if thats what they want Alfonso Dasits told the Spanish newspaper El Pas But if Gibraltar wants a relationship with the EU it will have to go through usTo longtime residents the implication is so clear it doesnt even need to be stated With Britain and Gibraltar out of the EU Spain could decide to sharply limit movement at the border choking off the territorys thriving economy which is built on financial services online gambling and e-commerceMost people here do not think Spanish authorities actually would go that far But as residents know from bitter experience it has been done beforeNever underestimate the lengths that the Spanish government will go to to damage Gibraltar said Edward Macquisten chief_executive of the Gibraltar Chamber of Commerce Thats the lesson of our historyIndeed steady as the Rock of Gibraltar may be a familiar phrase worldwide but through millennia of war siege and disputed control this place has rarely been placidIts location on a peninsula jutting into the Mediterranean with clear views of the African and European coasts plus the nine-mile-wide strait that bears Gibraltars name has made it an incomparable military prize The Rock itself is a natural fortress its sheer walls deterring all but the most dogged invadersBut the same factors that made Gibraltar so coveted have also made it the object of damaging battles as the tunnels cannon batteries and pockmarked stone walls that litter the verdant Rock attestWith only one road in and out Gibraltar is also highly vulnerable to siege In 1969 the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco took advantage of that weakness abruptly closing the border The territory was cut_off from supplies and deprived of workers Families divided by the separation were forced to shout news of births and deaths across a fence their words dying in the sea wind on particularly blustery daysThe border was not fully reopened for 16 years creating a bitter and lasting memoryWe dont_want to go back to a situation of history revisiting itself said Jennifer Ballantine director of the Gibraltar Garrison Library It was painful enough the first timeChief Minister of Gibraltar Fabian Picardo insists that that is not going to happen and that neither is any form of Spanish sovereignty an idea Gibraltarians emphatically rejected in a 2002 referendumThe people of France are French the people of Germany are German and the people of Gibraltar are British Picardo said in an interview in his handsome offices off Gibraltars Main Street which is lined with fruit-laden orange trees and red postal boxes bearing the seal of Queen Elizabeth IIBritains vote for Brexit Picardo said was a moment of deep sorrow in Gibraltar because residents are committed Europeans and because they knew the vote to leave would give Spain leverageBut now that Britain has made its choice he said it is vital for the territory to retain access to the single European market and to preserve fluid movement for the 12000 workers who cross the border daily He said Britains government will fight for bothI have absolutely no doubt that London understands how important those issues are for Gibraltar and for the United Kingdom he saidBritish officials have for their part insisted that they will not submit to Spanish demands Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson made that clear in typically colorful fashion declaring that Britain would maintain an implacable marmoreal and rock-like resistance to any effort to weaken its control over GibraltarBut even so Gibraltars plucky residents are girding themselves for possible hard times The monkeys Europes only free-range colony are here to stay and so are the British But that doesnt mean life wont become roughThe Gibraltarian is a born survivor Weve been through sieges through wars through all kinds of bad times said Vallejo Smith the tour guide historian and lifelong resident who at 68 speaks from personal experience But somehow we always manage to come out afloat Karla_Adam in London contributed to this reportWith the transatlantic relationship on the line European leaders are trying to put a brave face on Donald Trumps new world orderThey may hold the American president-elect in profound disdain a feeling many But through gritted teeth they insist that the ties anchoring the globe since World_War II will endure if not with much warmth then at_least through the sort of transactional relations Trump can understandThat theory however will be put to the test as tweets and interviews turn into policy and actionAfter decades of transatlantic relations based on a shared set of interests and values Europe is reckoning with what could happen if only one of those remainsIts where interests and values intersect where were going to find problems said Robin Niblett director of the London-based think_tank Chatham House If our values stand for anything its open democratic societies and open markets If America moves away from those thats pretty fundamentalTrump supporters would undoubtedly say he is fully committed to democracy and capitalism But many Europeans view in his tweets and raucous rallies a fundamental shake-up of the values underpinning the liberal international orderAnalysts and former European officials say the list of potential flash points includes Russia Iran Israel and Palestine climate_change democracy promotion and global tradeTo European leaders the gap goes beyond mere policy differencesThe president-elects determination to embrace adversarial autocrats such as Russian President_Vladimir Putin even as he pointedly criticizes allied democrats such as German Chancellor_Angela Merkel his threats to discard internationally agreed deals such as the Paris climate accord or the Iranian nuclear agreement his indifference to the fate of the European_Union and dismissive approach toward NATO his apparent lack of concern about evidence of Russian_interference in the US election and his oft-repeated jabs at free_trade and the media all point to an Atlantic-size gulf between the new US commander in chief and the European establishment Serious tensions have erupted between Europe and Washington before think the freedom fries era when France and Germany rejected the Bush administrations march to war in Iraq But rarely have Europeans felt that fundamental values may be so deeply in oppositionWere getting into uncharted territory here where Europeans will have to strike a balance between a transatlantic relationship that remains intense and a deep fundamental disagreement on values and an interpretation of what democracy is about said Stefano Stefanini a former senior Italian diplomat who was his nations ambassador to NATO from 2007 to 2010It is difficult to know to what extent Trump will carry through on his foreign_policy promises In confirmation hearings his cabinet nominees have at times with the man who selected them Analysts also note that Trumps promises are often contradictoryBut European nerves were this week when Trump told interviewers from a British and a German newspaper that he thought more countries would follow Britain out of the EU that NATO was obsolete and that Merkel had made a catastrophic mistake by welcoming hundreds of thousands of refugeesThe sudden unpredictability of Europes most important global partner comes as the continent is deep in the throes of its own identity crisis reeling from the same populist shocks that brought Trump to power the fall of Italys center-left prime_minister and the emergence of in Eastern Europe are all considered symptoms of the anti-establishment tide washing over the Western worldYet unlike in Washington as of Friday the establishment remains in charge in most European capitalsBut no one knows for how longWith elections looming this year in the Netherlands France and Germany far-right parties are making a concerted push to end the centrist consensus that has prevailed in Western Europe for generations That dynamic coupled with Trumps unpredictability makes it almost impossible to say what contours the US-European relationship will take Theres absolutely huge uncertainty over what kind of US administration Europe will find itself dealing with said Adam Thomson director of the European Leadership Network and a former_British ambassador to NATO Theres also uncertainty for the Trump administration over what kind of Europe America will be dealing with For the most part European leaders have tried to project confidence that the Trump era will be business as usual with shared interests in combating terrorism tamping crises and promoting economic growth overriding any differencesBritain with one foot out the door of the EU has been particularly keen to cultivate close ties and ensure its special relationship with Washington remains intactEuropes accommodating response reflects how internally divided it has become and how little power it has relative to Washington The United_States spends vastly more on defense than Europe nearly three times as much as all European members of NATO combinedTrump has demanded that NATO_allies pay their own way while raising questions about whether he would come to members defense in the event of an attack His closest European ally is neither British prime_minister Theresa May nor Merkel but the bomb-throwing Brexit champion who wants Britains departure to be the trigger event in the EUs ultimate collapseThere has never been an American president who did_not support European integration Its a first A tragedy for Europe Stefanini saidDespite European division and weakness leaders could be left with little choice but to distance themselves from Trump if he follows through on pledges considered antithetical to European valuesA ban on Muslim immigration a resumption of the use of torture or an end to American participation in the Paris climate accord all Trump campaign promises would undoubtedly elicit strongly negative reactions in EuropeBut perhaps most critical will be his handling of two of the Wests adversaries Russia and IranTrump appears determined to improve ties with Putin just three years after Russian military intervention in Ukraine prompted the United_States and Europe to impose sanctionsIn theory much of Europe would welcome a lowering of tensions between Russia and the West said Thomson the former_British ambassador But the details will be criticalIts important for Europeans that this is not seen as some kind of sellout to Russia and that theres not a US-Russia deal done over European heads Thomson said On Iran too the maneuvering will be extremely delicate Trump has repeatedly attacked as a really really bad deal the negotiated in 2015 between Iran and six of the worlds leading powers the United_States the United Kingdom France Germany Russia and China Any Trump move to unilaterally pull the United_States out risks antagonizing every other party to the agreement Critics say it could also undermine global faith in Washingtons commitment to live up to its promises If Europe is going to effectively counter Trump however it will have to stay united And it is far from clear that it can The declaration was a signal not only to Trump but to her own voters ahead of an election in which she faces the likelihood of a far-right anti-immigrant party capturing seats in the Parliament for the first timeA lot of thinking in Berlin is already going into how we will have to reckon with Trump in actions he takes strategically or actions he takes that impact the Western liberal order said Daniela Schwarzer head of the German Council on Foreign RelationsBut there are limits to how far Germany can goEven if Germany is willing to take the lead it needs to work with others And this is a messy picture Schwarzer saidWith Britain focused on its EU exit London is unlikely to take a stand against Trump unless it is forced to do so Europes other major power France has its own struggles as it prepares for spring presidential elections in which a far-right party stands a chance of victoryWhoever wins French policy analysts said they feared their country was entering a new era of ties with WashingtonIn many ways its not so much what America will do but in a way what America has become said Dominique Moisi a co-founder of the French Institute for International Relations Its essence as much as its performance We dont_know what the performance is going to be but we have an inkling that the essence of America has changed Birnbaum reported from Brussels and McAuley from ParisRobert S_Mueller III was greeted with near universal praise when he was appointed to lead the investigation_into possible_coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election but as he builds his special_counsel team his every hire is under scrutinyAt least seven of the 15 lawyers Mueller has brought on to the special_counsel team have donated to Democratic political candidates five of them to Hillary_Clinton a fact that President Trump and his allies have eagerly highlighted These critics also point to some of the lawyers history working with clients connected to the Clintons and Muellers long history with former FBI_director as they question whether those assigned to the investigation can be impartialMany lawyers and ethics_experts say they can see no significant legal or ethical concerns with the teams political giving or past work and they note that Trump often misstates the facts as he casts aspersions But others say the optical problem is a real one that threatens to undermine public confidence in the probe In my view prosecutors who make political contributions are identifying fairly strongly with a political party said William P Barr who served_as attorney_general under George HW Bush I would have liked to see him have more balance on this groupCriticizing those conducting an investigation is not a new tactic Democrats famously in the crosshairs during his examination of President Bill_Clinton And by raising questions about the investigators early legal_analysts said Trump is laying the groundwork to question any results that are not to his likingBy staking out the position of partisanship through campaign contributions the president simply is setting a stage for a public relations assault down the road said Jacob Frenkel a defense lawyer at Dickinson Wright who previously worked in the now-defunct Office of the Independent CounselTrump hascalled the special_counsels investigation the single greatest in American political history adding that it was led by some very bad and conflicted people In a more recent the president said that Mueller was very very good friends with Comey which is very bothersome and that the people that have been hired are all Hillary_Clinton supporters some of them worked for Hillary ClintonI mean the whole thing is ridiculous if you want to know the truth from that standpoint Trump said But Robert Muellers an honorable man and hopefully hell come up with an honorable solutionAsked if Mueller would have to recuse_himself he said Were going to have to seeTrump supporters have raised similar concerns Former Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich that Republicans were delusional if they think the special_counsel is going to be fair The pro-Trump group Great America Alliance in which conservative commentator Tomi Lahren opined Only in Washington could a rigged game like this be called independentBut Attorney_General a strong Trump backer who has recused himself from the Russia probe was more circumspect on FridayMr Mueller is entitled lawfully I guess at this point to hire who he desires but I_think he should look for people who have strength and credibility by all people Sessions saidPressed on whether he had confidence in Mueller Sessions said I feel confident in what hell do Thats all I can say to you about thatMueller has brought in 15 attorneys to work with him among them former colleagues at the firm WilmerHale and veteran Justice_Department lawyers said Peter Carr a spokesman for the Special Counsels Office Only 13 have been publicly identifiedPut together the team is a formidable collection of legal talent and expertise with experience

Prosecution Force and a former deputy assistant attorney_general in the Office of Legal Counsel who also came from WilmerHaleRhee was on the team representing the Clinton_Foundation and another lawyer working with the special_counsel once represented Clinton aide Justin Cooper Zebley was Muellers chief of staff when Mueller served_as FBI directorCarr confirmed to The Washington_Post that a Justice_Department national_security division prosecutor a trial attorney in the fraud section and who had headed the public corruption unit in the US Attorneys Office in the Southern_District of New_York and an assistant US attorney in the Eastern District of New_York specializing in terrorism cases also had been assigned to work with the group Goldstein had worked in the office under US Attorney Preet Bharara who was fired by Trump after he refused to resign upon request and Ahmad was recently profiled by the New_Yorker for having prosecuted 13 terrorism cases without a single lossSeven special_counsel team members have donated to Democratic campaigns five of those to Clintons and their giving totals nearly $53000 The other six that are publicly known to be on the team did_not give any political contributions records showEthics experts said the giving should not preclude anyones participation Justice_Department policies and federal law actually when it comes to hiring for nonpolitical positions meaning Mueller might feel he cannot consider donation history when he makes hiresBottom line is I dont see how donations are relevant said Richard Painter who was the ethics lawyer for President George_W Bush Ive never heard of a single case where a prosecutor has been removed because of a political donation Quarless donations were the most substantial Over two_decades he gave more_than $30000 to various Democratic campaigns including $2700 to Clintons in 2016 But Quarles has also given to Republicans contributing $2500 in 2015 to Rep Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) chairman of the House Oversight Committee and $250 to then-Sen George Allen (R-Va) in 2005Rhee donated nearly $12000 to various Democratic campaigns including President_Barack Obamas and Clintons and Weissmann donated at_least $6600 Goldstein donated $3300 to Obamas campaigns Three others Van Grack Atkinson and in the Solicitor Generals office donated less_than $1000 between themSome experts said Trumps assertions provide no real basis to question the teams workTheres a bipartisan consensus that the various wild conflicts allegations that have been made by Trump and his allies are groundless said Norm Eisen a fellow at the Brookings Institution who served_as Obamas ethics czar It just is not the case that lawyers or investigators are disqualified by political activity of this kindTrump and his allies have also fixated on the longtime professional relationship between Mueller and Comey but the president might be overstating their relationshipThe two men played central roles in a 2004 incident during the George_W Bush administration that has entered Washington lore when both prepared to resign instead of go along with the reauthorization of a controversial surveillance program The episode became particularly famous for Comeys intervention at the hospital bed of then-Attorney General John AshcroftComey could be a key figure in Muellers_investigation The special_counsels probe includes a look at whether Trump attempted to in possibly trying to shut_down the investigation of former national_security adviser_Michael Flynn Comeys firing might be considered a piece of evidence in that caseEthics experts said they see no reason Mueller who is registered as a Republican would have a conflict And David N Kelley Comeys attorney disputed Trumps characterization of his client and Muellers connectionBob and Jim have a congenial relationship as former colleagues Both served long legal careers that involved overlapping time spent within the Department of Justice and thats pretty well documented But beyond that theyre not close personal friends Kelley said Theyre friends in the sense that co-workers are friends They dont really have a personal relationshipKelley said Comey had never been to Muellers home and Mueller had never been to Comeys home He said they had lunch together once and dinner together twice once with their spouses and once after Comey became FBI_director so Mueller could brief him on the job Once in 2004 with two others from the Justice_Department they played golf together Kelley saidKelley said Deputy Attorney_General knew of Mueller and Comeys relationship before naming Mueller as the special_counsel Rosenstein himself was appointed by TrumpI dont_think Jim has given it a lot of thought but why would Bob be conflicted Kelley said Bobs not conducting an investigation where Jim is pitted against a target of the investigation If anything hes a witnessMueller also has professional connections and some of those are allied with TrumpAlthough he resigned to take the special_counsel job Mueller had worked for the law_firm WilmerHale whose lawyers represent Trumps former campaign_chairman Trumps daughter Ivanka and the presidents son-in-law Justice_Department ethics_experts ultimately despite that and Carr said they gave the same consideration and approval to others from his firmOn the day of North_Koreas first atomic test in 2006 aides to President George_W Bush began phoning foreign capitals to reassure allies startled by Pyongyangs surprising feat The test aides said had been mostly a failure a botched 1-kiloton cry for attention from a regime that had no warheads or reliable delivery systems and would never be allowed to obtain themThe current course that they are on is unacceptable State_Department spokesman Sean McCormack said publicly at the time and the international_community is going to actA decade later that confidence has all but evaporated After a week in which Pyongyang successfully lobbed into the Sea of Japan US officials are no_longer seeing North_Koreas weapons tests as amateurish attention-grabbing provocations Instead they are viewed as evidence of a rapidly growing threat and one that increasingly defies solutionOver the past_year technological advances in North_Koreas nuclear and missile_programs have dramatically raised the stakes in the years-long standoff between the United_States and the reclusive communist regime according to current and former US officials and Korea experts Pyongyangs growing arsenal has rattled key US allies and spurred efforts by all sides to develop new first-strike capabilities increasing the risk that a simple mistake could trigger a devastating regional war the analysts saidThe military developments are coming at a time of unusual political ferment with a new and largely untested administration in Washington and with South_Koreas government coping with an Longtime observers say the risk of conflict is higher than it has been in years and it is likely to rise further as North_Korean leader Kim_Jong Un seeks to fulfill his pledge to field long-range missiles capable of striking US citiesThis is no_longer about a lonely dictator crying for attention or demanding negotiations said Victor Cha a former adviser on North_Korea to the Bush administration and the Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International_Studies a Washington think_tank This is now a military testing program to acquire a proven capability Pyongyangs ambition to become an advanced nuclear-armed state is not new North_Korea began building its first reactor for making plutonium more_than three decades ago Over the years it has shown ingenuity in increasing the range and power of a stockpile of homemade short- and medium-range missiles all based on Soviet-era designsOften in the past the new innovations have been accompanied by demands a clamoring for security guarantees and international respect by a paranoid and nearly friendless government that perceives its democratic neighbors as plotting its destruction After the first atomic test in 2006 then-leader Kim_Jong Il threatened to launch nuclear missiles unless Washington agreed to face-to-face talksNorth Korea has been slammed instead with ever-tighter meant to cut_off access to technology and foreign cash flows Yet despite the trade restrictions diplomatic isolation threats and occasional sabotage the countrys weapons programs have continued their upward march goaded forward by dictators willing to sacrifice their citizens well-being to grow the countrys military mightAnd now in the progress is coming in leapsPyongyangs occurred on Sept9 on the 68th anniversary of North_Koreas founding Seismic monitoring stations picked up vibrations from the underground blast and quickly determined that this one was exceptionalScientific analyses of the test determined that the new bombs explosive yield approached 30kilotons two times the force of the Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima Japan in 1945 The device was twice as powerful as the bomb North_Korea tested just nine months earlier and it was 30times stronger than one detonated in 2006 in a remote mountain tunnel More ominously North_Korea last March displayed a new compact bomb one that appears small enough to fit inside the nose cone of one of its indigenously produced missilesRegardless of whether the miniature bomb is real or a clever prop North_Korea does finally appear to be on the verge of a nuclear breakout said Robert Litwak an expert on nuclear proliferation and director of International Security Studies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars He said Pyongyangs arsenal is believed to now contain as many as 20 nuclear bombs along with enough plutonium and highly enriched uranium to make dozens moreWhen I got into this field Litwak said at a symposium on North_Korea this month I couldnt have conceived of North_Korea acquiring a nuclear arsenal approaching half the size of Great BritainsThe countrys missiles also have grown more sophisticated Last year North_Koreas military conducted the first test of a a significant advance over the countrys existing liquid-fueled rockets because they can be moved easily and launched quickly Also in 2016 North_Korea broadcast images of engineers testing engines for a new class of advanced missiles with true intercontinental range potentially putting cities on the US mainland within reachThe provocations have continued in the weeks since the inauguration of President Trump who just before taking office appeared to taunt Pyongyang in a Twitter post saying that North_Koreas plan for building intercontinental_ballistic missiles A month later Kim launched one of the countrys new solid-fuel missiles interrupting with visiting Japanese_Prime Minister_Shinzo Abe Last weeks coordinated launch of four intermediate-range missiles appeared intended to showcase the countrys ability to fire multiple rockets simultaneously at US military bases in Japan increasing the likelihood that some will penetrate antimissile shieldsNorth Koreas state-run media has occasionally shown propaganda footage of Kim huddling with his generals over what some analysts have jokingly called the map of death a chart that portrays Japanese and US mainland cities as potential targetsThe laughter has now stopped said Jeffrey_Lewis an expert on North_Korean weapons systems This idea that these things were just bargaining chips something that was true years_ago is superseded by the fact that there is now a rocket force with a commander and a headquarters and subordinate bases all with missiles said Lewis director of the East_Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation_Studies This is now a living breathing thingThere have been notable failures as well Numerous test rockets have drifted far off course and others never made it off the launchpad Many analysts say it could still be several years before Kim can construct a true ICBM that could reliably reach the US mainland and perhaps longer before he can demonstrate an ability to incorporate a nuclear payload into his rocket design Yet already the basic components for a future arsenal of long-range nuclear-tipped missiles are in place Lewis saidThe ICBM program is real Lewis said Theyve showed us their static engine test They showed us the mock-up of the nuclear_warhead They have done everything short of actually testing the ICBM When they do test it the first time it will probably fail But eventually it will work And when it works people are going to freak outFor decades the United_States and its East Asian allies have tried an array of strategies to blunt North_Koreas progress ranging from diplomacy to covert operations to defensive antimissile shields Lately the search for solutions has taken on an intensity not seen in yearsAs diplomatic initiatives have stalled US Japanese and South_Korean officials have broadened the search for measures to ensure that Pyongyangs missiles remain grounded or in the event of a launch can be brought down before they reach their target The efforts have proved to be partly successful at bestThree years_ago alarmed by North_Koreas advances on missile systems the Obama_administration ordered the Pentagon and intelligence_agencies to deploy highly classified cyber and electronic measures against North_Korea largely aimed_at undermining the countrys nuclear and missile_programs two former senior administration officials said Aspects of the initiatives were described in The effort was further intensified last_year the officials said in response to new intelligence assessments showing North_Korea inching closer to its goal of fielding long-range ballistic_missiles The clandestine effort begun under President_Barack Obama appears to have borne fruit judging from a rash of missile failures in the past_year said one former official familiar with the program The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the secret operationsWere stopping shipments Were making sure things dont work the way theyre supposed to one former official said Weve been able to delay things in some cases probably by a lot Its a cat-and-mouse gameBut the second official familiar with the Pentagons cyberwarfare efforts acknowledged that North_Korea remains an exceptionally difficult target because of its isolation and limited digital infrastructure The official suggested that at_least some of the recent missile failures were probably caused by North_Korean errors I would be wary of claiming too_much he saidWe were trying to use all the tools that were available to us in order to degrade as much of their capabilities as possible a second former official said But we just did_not have nearly as much game as we should haveIn handoff meetings with Trump Obama described the gathering threat in stark terms calling it the most serious proliferation challenge facing the new administration according to aides familiar with the discussions The Trump White_House has since convened three deputies committee meetings on North_Korea and ordered a new top-to-bottom threat assessment White_House officials say that Trump is weighing all options from a new diplomatic initiative to enhanced military capabilities possibly including a highly controversial return of tactical nuclear_weapons to South_Korea for the first time since the early 1990sThe administration is dispatching Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to East_Asia this week to confer with counterparts in Beijing Tokyo and Seoul And the White_House is defending its decision last_week to send antimissile batteries to South_Korea despite vehement opposition from ChinaThe initiatives have failed to calm tensions in the region As more missiles streak across North_Koreas eastern coast Japanese and South_Korean officials are pledging increased investments in defensive shields and highly accurate conventionally armed missiles designed to preemptively destroy North_Korean launch sites and command centers if an attack seems imminent North_Korea has responded with similar threats describing its recent missile_launches as a dry run for a preemptive the presumed staging ground for forces preparing to come to South_Koreas aid if war breaks outIn the past such a strike would be seen as suicidal as it would certainly result in a devastating counterattack against North_Korea that would probably destroy the regime itself But Kim is betting that an arsenal of long-range nuclear-tipped missiles would serve as an effective deterrent said Cha the former Bush administration adviserThats why they want to be able to reach the continental United_States so they can effectively hold us hostage Cha said Do we really want to trade Los Angeles for whatever city in North KoreaSuch an attack on the US mainland is not yet within North_Koreas grasp and US officials hope they can eventually neutralize the threat with improvements in antimissile systems But in the meantime each new advance increases the chance that a small mishap could rapidly escalate into all-out war Cha said In a crisis everyone is put in a use-it-or-lose-it situation in which everyone feels he has to go first he saidThe growing danger now he said is miscalculation Ellen_Nakashima contributed to this reportTensions between Republicans and Democrats over the investigation of Russian involvement in the 2016_presidential election intensified Sunday with President Trump demanding to know why his campaign is under federal scrutiny while his former opponent Hillary_Clinton is not The presidents latest outburst over the inquiry led by special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III surfaced on Twitter as his administration braced for the possibility that the first batch of charges in the case could be publicly announced as soon as Monday that a federal grand_jury had approved an indictment although details of the possible charges and the name of a defendant remained unclearTrump issued four tweets over 24 minutes attacking the Mueller probe as unfair and citing various Clinton controversies that he said warranted investigation Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia collusion which doesnt exist the president said The Dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) Witch Hunt for evil politics but the Rs are now fighting back like never before There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton and now the facts are pouring out DO SOMETHINGLater in the morning Trump added All of this Russia talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts & Reform Is this coincidental NOTOn Sunday talk shows Republicans rallied around Trump and questioned how CNN could have received information about secret grand_jury proceedingsThere are very very strict laws on grand_jury secrecy so depending on who leaked this to CNN thats a criminal violation potentially New_Jersey Gov Chris Christie (R) a longtime friend of Trumps said on CNNs State of the Union on Sunday For us to have confidence in this process weve got to make_sure that the grand_jury process remains confidential remains secret so that the special_counsel can work effectively to be able to get to the bottom of all that hes looking intoHouse Majority_Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif) cast doubt on the objectivity of Muellers_team noting that the prosecutors staff includes a lot of individuals attorneys who played in politics whove given money on the Democratic side Of the eight attorneys on the team who have been publicly identified including President_Barack Obama and Clinton This president won the election solely on the idea that he connected with the American people No other influence involved McCarthy said on Foxs Sunday Morning Futures But the idea of what Ive watched of what the Democrats have been doing it sure raises a lot of questionsRep Trey Gowdy (R-SC) chairman of the House Oversight Committee came to Muellers defense and said that he doesnt agree with Republicans who are calling for Mueller to resign or stop his investigation I would encourage my Republican friends give the guy a chance to do his job Gowdy said on Fox_News Sunday The result will be known by the facts by what he uncovers I would say give the guy a chance to do his jobDemocratic lawmakers mostly stayed out of the Sunday fray after a week in which Clintons 2016 campaign came under fresh scrutiny The campaign funded political opposition_research into Trump that helped create a highly publicized dossier on the Republican candidate and fueled some allegations now under_scrutiny by MuellerThe 35-page dossier is composed of 17 memos containing raw intelligence some of it highly salacious and not independently confirmed It relies on Kremlin-linked sources and alleges that the Russian_government had been trying to support Trumps candidacy while gathering compromising_information that could be used as blackmail The dossier was published by BuzzFeed in January Its unclear how_much the Clinton campaign and Democratic_National Committee paid for the opposition_research by Fusion_GPS a Washington firm that conducts investigations for private clients The Clinton campaign paid $56million in legal fees to a law_firm from June 2015 to December 2016 according to campaign finance records and the DNC paid the firm $36 million in legal and compliance consulting since November 2015 Its impossible to tell from the filings how_much of that work was for other legal matters and how_much of it related to Fusion GPSTrump tweeted Sunday morning that the dossier which he called Clinton made Fake Dossier could have cost as much as $12 million although he did_not explain how he reached that number Trump was at it again early Monday In a tweet Trump again cited funding reports without elaborating on a source Report out that Obama Campaign paid $972000 to Fusion_GPS Trump wrote The firm also got $12400000 (really) from DNC Nobody knows who OKdCompiled by former_British intelligence agent Christopher_Steele the dossier mirrors a separate conclusion reached by US intelligence_agencies that the Russian_government intervened in the US election in an effort to bolster Trump and harm Clinton such as through hacking the DNC and distributing materials to WikiLeaks to publish at key momentsFusion GPS which hired Steele to gather information was first employed to investigate Trump during the Republican primaries by the a conservative publication that receives financial support from billionaire GOP donor Paul Singer according to two people_familiar with Singer The Beacon said in a statement that its research ended before Fusion_GPS hired Steele and that none of the research that it commissioned is included in the dossier In April_2016 an and the DNC hired Fusion_GPS which then hired Steele Brian Fallon a former spokesman for the Clinton campaign said he learned about Steele and the dossier after the election People familiar with the matter told The Washington_Post that the Clinton campaign and the DNC did_not direct Steeles activitiesRep Adam B Schiff (Calif) the ranking_Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence said Sunday that a lot of the information in the dossier has been corroborated I certainly would have liked to know who paid for it earlier but nonetheless thats just one factor to be considered Schiff said on ABCs This Week on Sunday It doesnt answer the ultimate question which is How much of the work is accurate How much of it is true And my colleagues dont seem particularly interested in that question but that is really the most important question for the American peopleSchiff said he has not been told anything about any impending indictments in Muellers_investigation noting that such notification would not have been appropriate Trump also tweeted Sunday about Clintons involvement in what he called the Uranium to Russia deal demanding that the matter receive greater scrutinyThe while Clinton was secretary of state allowed a Russian nuclear energy agency to acquire a controlling stake in a Canadian-based company that had mining licenses for about 20percent of US uranium_extraction capacity The company cannot export the uranium Earlier this month House and Senate Republican leaders announced they would and the House Oversight Committee launched a probe into during the campaign In the latter investigation Republicans say they want to know why then-FBI Director_James B_Comey publicly announced that the bureau was investigating Clinton but waited months before making a similar announcement about its inquiries into the Trump campaign Ed OKeefe Karoun Demirjian and Brian Murphy contributed to this reportBEIJING President-elect Donald Trump and North_Korean leader Kim_Jong Un have been trading threats this week while China poses as the mature reasonable kid on the blockKim kicked things off in a New Years address Sunday by saying his country was close to test-launching an_intercontinental ballistic_missile (ICBM) which if successful could ultimately put a nuclear_warhead within range of parts of the United StatesTrump who had once suggested inviting Kim over for a hamburger to persuade him to give up his nuclear_weapons program took to his usual medium to respondNorth Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear_weapon capable of reaching parts of the US It wont happen Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) But how experts asked did the US president-elect aim to stop it happeningThe head of the Brookings Institution offered one interpretationHas our next commander-in-chief issued 18 days before his Inaugration a pledge that the US will wage preemptive war against the DPRK Strobe Talbott (@strobetalbott) South_Korea not wanting perhaps to contemplate that possibility of rockets raining down on the Korean_Peninsula took a different view Its Foreign_Ministry said Trump in his tweet had issued a clear warning to North_Korea that showed his awareness of the urgency of the threat and that he will not waver from a policy of imposing sanctionsBecause of our active outreach President-elect Trump and US officials are clearly aware of the gravity and urgency of the North_Korean nuclear threat ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck told a briefing They are maintaining an unwavering stance on the need for sanctions on North_Korea and for close cooperation between South_Korea and the USThis also raises the issue of how_much interpretation should be required for the tweets of what will soon be the most_powerful man in the world Euan Graham director of the international security program atthe Lowy Institute in Sydney said the world was on the slippery slope of trying to interpret one mans not particularly coherent tweets But he added that the exchange has increased the chances that North_Korea could be the first crisis out of the box in the Trump presidency at_least in AsiaCertainly Trump does appear to be concerned about the issueCiting a senior US intelligence official that Trumps first and at that time only request for a special classified intelligence briefing was for one on North_Korea and its nuclear_weapons program Obama also reportedly made clear his concerns over the issue at his handover conversation with TrumpBut what is Trump going to do His next tweet offered a clue Get China to do moreChina has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the US in totally one-sided trade but wont help with North_Korea Nice Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Those comments did_not go down particularly well in Beijing which argued it had been long pushing for the denuclearization of the Korean_Peninsula and cast itself as the voice of reason and moderationChinas efforts in this regard are perfectly obvious Foreign_Ministry spokesman_Geng Shuang told a regular news_conference As a permanent member of the UN_Security Council we have proactively participated in relevant discussions on the North_Korean nuclear issue and have jointly passed several resolutions with other partiesThis shows Chinas responsible attitudeChinas nationalist Global_Times newspaper took the argument a stage further saying that Trump was pandering to irresponsible attitudes and stoking the anxieties of some Americans in his accusations against ChinaChinese foreign_policy experts say the United_States was wrong to blame their country arguing that the fundamental motivation for North_Korea formally known as the Democratic_Peoples Republic of Korea or DPRK to develop nuclear_weapons is American hostilityThe DPRK feels unsafe because the United_States wants to overthrow it said Cai Jian a professor of Korea studies at Fudan University in Shanghai Now the United_States blames China and believes China is irresponsible This is very ridiculousThe United_States has long insisted that North_Korea must disarm before talks can be held and has responded to the countrys nuclear and missile_tests by tightening sanctions The latest round was imposed by the UN_Security Council in November and supported by ChinaBut despite the sanctions data shows trade between China and North_Korea is still growing said GrahamKim has put North_Koreas nuclear_weapons policy at the center of his countrys national and security strategy China would like Pyongyang to abandon the program but is unwilling to do anything that might destabilize the regime Western experts sayFrustration with China over the issue is something Trump shares with all of his immediate predecessors Graham said but the president-elects generally hard line toward Beijing would only make it dig in its heels more firmly he saidMeanwhile Trumps brash style has been something of a propaganda gift for BeijingTheres a funny sort of inversion game going on there Graham said China is trying to posture as the global stakeholder and the reliable party for regional peace and global governance whereas the United_States is in Chinas eyes reeling around like a punch-drunk heavyweightThe threat of an American missile_defense system being stationed in South_Korea appears to have concentrated minds in Beijing on how to punish PyongyangChina now seems ready to support limited United_Nations sanctions against North_Korea over a recent nuclear_test and rocket launches partly in response to US pressure experts said MondayBeijing has reacted angrily to the prospect of the Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defense_(THAAD) system being deployed in South_Korea but a tougher line from Washington and Seoul seems to be having some effect on Beijings calculations experts said on Monday China Daily argued that the missile_defense system was not the answer to the North_Korean crisisThere will be no ground for its introduction should the parties agree to a sanctions package that is sufficient for Pyongyang to reevaluate its nuclear program the editorial said For that to happen the new UN resolution must truly bite The editorial echoes comments by Foreign Minister Wang Yi who in Munich on Friday that the United_Nations should adopt a resolution to ensure North_Korea will pay the necessary price and to show there is a consequence for its behaviorChina of course would never admit it was reacting to American pressure It still favors much weaker sanctions than those proposed by the United_States and is likely locked in negotiations to soften the blow according to Yanmei Xie a senior China analyst at the International Crisis Group in BeijingIt could even be argued that Beijing is merely hyping the likely effect of a limited sanctions package to convince Seoul that the anti-missile system deployment is unnecessary and to cast Washington as the real troublemakerStill even nationalist tabloid Monday that China should shift policy toward North_Korea in the face of mounting pressure and growing challengesIt argued that elite and public opinion was changing with greater numbers of people now seeing North_Korea as a burden and an annoying neighbor rather_than an old friend This in turn led to a shift in favor of actions that make Pyongyang feel pain for its obduracyThe more Chinas policy in this regard departs from public opinion the more political cost China has to pay the Global_Times wroteAfter North_Korea launched a rocket this month apparently to test its ballistic_missile technology Seoul agreed to begin talks with Washington on deploying a THAAD unit with the US military in South KoreaTHAAD is a land-based system designed to shoot down incoming short- medium- and intermediate-range missiles and could offer South_Korea and some of the 25000 US troops deployed there greater protection against missiles launched from the NorthThe threat of deployment comes amid growing frustration in both Seoul and Washington not only with Pyongyangs actions but also with Chinas muted response But some Chinese experts argue the THAAD system is mainly used for intercepting long-range missiles rather_than short-range ones and that its real target is China They argue that the proposal has undermined Beijings friendship with Seoul and widened distrust with the United StatesForeign Ministry_spokesman Hong Lei said Monday that the missile_defense system would directly violate Chinas strategic security interests and he condemned relevant countries for using the Korea peninsula issue to undermine those interestsThere is still a huge gulf separating China and the United_States in terms of their strategic goals over the North_Korea issue said Shi Yinhong director of the Center for American Studies at Renmin University of China in BeijingHe said China was willing to speed up US Security_Council negotiations but would not agree to any sanctions that covered its own trade with North_Korea or affected its neighbors access to food or oilAny sanctions he said would be less tough than measures China itself adopted in 2013 shortly_after President_Xi Jinping took power and at a time when relations with Washington were on an upswingNow it is impossible for China to do the same thing given the state of Sino-US_relations he said Also if China sanctions North_Korea like it did in 2013 North_Korea will become more of an enemyThe Crisis Groups Xie said China probably aims to do just enough in terms of sanctions to placate the South_Korean government and convince Seoul to again drag its feet over the THAAD_deployment as it has done for yearsChina may agree to narrow sanctions targeting certain individuals and entities but not those that could remotely threaten to destabilize the country or regime or turn North_Korea into an openly hostile neighbor she saidSanctions of that nature might dial up the pressure on the North_Korean regime a notch but are very unlikely to persuade it to abandon a nuclear program that has become a cornerstone of the regimes national_security calculations experts saidDays after being sworn in President Trump insisted to congressional leaders invited to a reception at the White_House that he would have won the popular_vote had it not been for millions of illegal votes according to people_familiar with the meetingTrump has repeatedly claimed without evidence that widespread voter fraud caused him to lose the popular_vote to Hillary_Clinton even while he clinched the presidency with an electoral college victoryTwo peoplefamiliar with the meeting said Trump spent about 10 minutes at the start of the bipartisan gathering rehashing the campaign He also told them that between 3 million and 5 million illegal votes caused him to lose the popular voteThe discussion about Trumps election victory andhis claim that he would have won the popular_vote was confirmed by a thirdperson familiar with the meetingThe claim is and found virtually no confirmed cases of voter fraud let alone millionsClinton won the popular_vote by more_than 28 million votes Trump won 304 electoral college votes to Clintons 227 House Majority_Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif) alluded to Trumps comments as he returned to the Capitol from the meeting Monday nightWe talked about different electoral college popular votes going through the different ones McCarthy said Well we talked about going back through past elections Everyone in there goes through elections and stuff so everybodys giving their different histories of different partsAsked by reporters after the meeting if Trump made any surprising statements at the gathering House Minority Leader Nancy_Pelosi (D-Calif) replied Well I wont even go into thatJia Yongtang doesnt have much luck with the ladies He thinks its because of all the weight hes put on More likely its because his online dating picture shows him as the spitting image of Kim_Jong UnThe North_Korean leader might be one of the most reviled people in the world but Jia has reason to be happy about the notoriety that comes with Pyongyangs endless missile_launches and occasional nuclear_tests For the past four years Jia has been making a living of sorts trading on his uncanny resemblance to the young dictatorSome people are excited some people are scared said Jia wearing sunglasses and a navy-blue Mao suit with a plastic version of the red Kim badge that all North_Koreans must wear over their hearts on the street in Taiyuan the capital of coal-producing Shanxi province I get a lot of requests for selfies Two young women stopped and gasped when they saw Kim getting into a black Mercedes-Benz SUV with a reporter They stopped and whispered to each other trying to figure out if it really was Kim But no requests for selfiesAs the worlds attention turns to Beijing to see if it will punish Kim for his the case of Jia is something of a metaphor for the complicated relations between China and North KoreaChinas view of North_Korea is very different from that of the United_States Sure Beijing doesnt appreciate Kims efforts to develop deliverable nuclear_weapons and there are signs of a slight chill on the border between the two_countries but China is not trying to bring about regime change or much change at allFurthermore theres a kind of nostalgia here among older people in particular for the simpler communist life the good old days before cutthroat capitalism arrived in China Jia whos about 5 foot 3 was working as a security guard in 2012 outside the Birds Nest one of the stadiums built for the Beijing Olympics when someone commented on his resemblance to Kim who had become the third-generation leader of North_Korea a few months beforeHe decided to take advantage of the likeness but becoming a more obvious Kim_Jong Un took some work For starters Jia weighed only 130 pounds when he decided to morph into the North_Korean leader but with some concerted fried-rice consumption hes managed to get to 190 pounds (about 10 pounds lighter than the Internet estimates the real Kim weighs)He grew out his bangs and now has a Kim coif so perfect that some people think its a wigHe appears in character at random events and even has a brief scene at the end of a new film called Drunk Youth with the Chinese Barack_Obama Ending a meeting the pair waves and makes peace signs at the cameraYes Jia has seen about the assassination of Kim that led to the entertainment company being hacked by North_Korea He was not impressed with Randall Park the Korean American who played the dictatorIt would be safe to say that Jia is not on the brink of breaking into the big time His regular gigs involve appearing often alongside his self-appointed mentor a Mao Zedong impersonator named Xiong Ding Jian at minor events and standing around just looking like KimSometimes Jia breaks into a half-intelligible speech in Korean that hes memorized wishing people a happy new year and saying I love China When a reporter gently pointed out that he was saying hello in the South_Korean way not the version most commonly used in North_Korea Jia got defensive All Koreans speak the same language he said Unspoken Dont mess with my artLike the real Kim this doppelganger is afraid the Americans are after him Im afraid the Americans will come here to kill me That theyll think Im really Kim_Jong Un and will come here to kill me he said a little nervouslyBut that doesnt stop him from getting out and about in ChinaOn a recent day he appeared as a judge at a talent show in a dance school on the 19th floor of a high-rise building here in Taiyuan a second-tier city in Chinas industrial heartland As Taiyuans answer to Simon Cowell put the kids through their paces Jia sat there in his dark suit and darker glasses watching and occasionally clappingThe kids had no idea who he was supposed to be When one young girls mother said the leader of North_Korea the girls face remained blankJia and Xiong came to Taiyuan at the invitation of the local cultural heritage department and appeared at events with Mao praising the citys development while Kim stood alongside himOver lunch with Jia and Xiong afterward some locals praised the two strongmenWe are very honored to have them here We have a lot of respect for North_Korea and Kim_Jong Un because he is the leader of a socialist country said one of the pairs lunchmates a retired military educator who uttered words that wouldnt have been out of place in his classroomA businessman chimed in Kim_Jong Uns father had a really good friendship with China so we like the son We have a lot of respect for himAsked further about Chinas relationship with North_Korea the men demurred saying they were just common people who didnt know much about politics and suggesting that the subject was too sensitive to be discussedAsked what Mao would have made of Kim Xiong took the diplomatic route I dont_know thats for the older generation to answer he said If his father hadnt died we would be closer than we are now At that time North_Korea respected China As Mao said North_Korea should listen to its big brotherI care about the heart not the politics of being an actor Jia addedBut in matters of the heart hes not doing so well Xiong and the others tease Jia for being unmarried at 34 calling him an old man in an empty nestBut he rejects the suggestion that his Kim routine is damaging his chances I_think it probably helps he said adding that his profile picture entices women to start conversations with him Some girls think I look like a

the pro-President Trump CNN contributorTheir Friday conversation on Real Time with Bill Maher intensified then boiled over as they talked about whether alleged Russian vote manipulation helped make Trump presidentUnless you can manipulate the votes in the machine you havent done it Lord told MaherI like you and I heard youre a very nice guy but dont bull- me Maher replied There are other ways you can affect an election and one of them is to hack the emails of one side and release those as a slow drip drip drip drip dripThe pair continued to parry as the conversation pivoted to Trumps unreleased tax returnsRespectfully I say to you this becomes a political gotcha game Lord said defending the presidents decision to not release them We_need to get the country moving again rightNot if the country is being led by someone who was put there by a foreign power Maher repliedTrump and the people whove defended him on national television have faced a barrage of criticism over what role the Russian_government played in the 2016 electionAs The Washington Posts The past few days have brought a growing list of confirmed communications between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials with each new revelation adding to a cloud of suspicion that hangs over the White_House as critics demand an independent investigation The Trump administration at first denied any contact with the RussiansRecently the Trump team has acknowledged meetings happened but described them as polite introductions Helderman reportedMichael Flynn was forced to resign as national_security adviser because of his pre-inauguration contacts with Russian_Ambassador Sergey_Kislyak including a meeting alongside Trumps son-in-law and senior adviser Jared KushnerThrough it all Lord has been helping to

thatBritish Prime_Minister Theresa May told congressional Republicans on Thursday that the election of President Trump had ushered in the dawn of a new era of American renewal and said the United_States and Britain could lead together again in a modern world fraught with uncertainty and dangerAddressing the GOP members of Congress at their annual retreat May walked a tightrope between praise for and criticism of the new administrations emerging foreign_policy alternating between support for some of the positions Trump has staked out and a clear rejection of othersShe urged engagement with Russia but to beware of its president Vladimir_Putin She defended the value of NATO and the United_Nations while acknowledging they need changes to meet current-day needs She criticized Irans support of the government in the Syrian civil_war and its malign influence in the region but defended the nuclear deal as deterring Tehran from building a bombMay said the United_States and Britain were working together to defeat the ideology of Islamist extremism but in an aside suggested she does_not back the idea of banning visitors and refugees from majority-Muslim countriesWe should always be careful to distinguish between this extreme and hateful ideology and the peaceful religion of Islam and the hundreds of millions of its adherents she said Nor is it enough merely to focus on violent extremism We_need to address the whole spectrum of extremism starting with the bigotry and hatred that can so often turn to violence Many of Mays remarks were met with enthusiastic applause and standing ovations even more_than when Trump spoke before the group earlier in the day On Friday May will be the first foreign leader to visit the White_House since Trump was sworn in and she spoke repeatedly of the special relationship between the United_States and Britain epitomized by the friendship between Republican president Ronald_Reagan and the Conservative prime_minister Margaret ThatcherAnother common theme was the alienation many Americans and Britons feel in an era of globalization helping sweep Trump and May before him to power Part of Mays mission is to promote trade between the two_countries as Britain prepares to leave the European UnionPeople often those on modest incomes living in relatively rich countries like our own feel that the global system of free markets and free_trade is simply not working for them in its current form she saidThe speech gave May the opportunity to present Republicans with a sweeping vision of what she depicted as their shared conservative worldview one built on liberty open markets and universal rights To make her case she repeatedly invoked the three great heroes of conservative transatlantic history Churchill Reagan and ThatcherShe also used language notably more partisan than that of her predecessors hailing the November election as an opportunity for American renewalBecause of that great victory you have won she told the Republicans to loud applause America can be stronger greater and more confident in the years aheadBut amid her lavish praise were constant reminders of just how far Trump has deviated from the conservative worldview she describedOn trade security multinational institutions and most conspicuously on Russia May laid out stances that are in keeping with a long tradition of Western consensus but that Trump has unceremoniously discardedBy raising the differences without explicitly naming them May almost seemed to be willing Trump to return to the fold of traditional transatlantic foreign policyLess than a week after Trump proclaimed America first and suggested a shrinking global mandate for the United_States May informed the crowd that Global Britain intended to take on an even more internationalist role where we meet our responsibilities to our friends and allies champion the international cooperation and partnerships that project our values around the world and continue to act as one of the strongest and most forceful advocates for business free markets and free_trade anywhere around the globeAs if to underline just how far that vision is from Trumps as she spoke the White_House threatened to slap a 20_percent tariff on Mexican imports amid a dispute over who will pay for the presidents planned border wallUnlike Trump a vociferous critic of alliances and multilateral institutions May defended organizations such as the United_Nations NATO and even the EUIn contrast with Trumps protectionism she gave an enthusiastic endorsement of free_trade and aggressively plugged the US-British trade deal she hopes that she and Trump can ultimately reachThe most jarring difference between May and Trump however was on Russia Although Trump has appeared eager to win over Putin May urged caution She offered support for nations in the Baltics that have been menaced by Russia and cited the illegal annexation of Crimea as legitimate reasons for them to feel afraid Although Trump has questioned whether the United_States should come to the defense of NATO_allies in the event of an attack May was unequivocalWe should not jeopardize the freedoms that President Reagan and Mrs Thatcher brought to Eastern Europe by accepting President Putins claim that it is now in his sphere of influence she said in a line that received thundering applauseWhen it comes to Russia as so often it is wise to turn to the example of President Reagan who during negotiations with his opposite number Mikhail Gorbachev used to abide by the adage Trust but verify she said in a speech that drew repeated rounds of applause and ovationsWith President Putin my advice is to engage but bewareMay also said she thought that Britain and America should never again invade foreign countries The days of Britain and America intervening in sovereign countries in an attempt to remake the world in our own image are over she saidBritish voters have defied the will of their leaders foreign allies and much of the political establishment by opting to rupture this countrys primary connection to Europe in a stunning result that will radiate economic and political uncertainty across the globeThe voters decision to jettison Britains membership in the European_Union was expected to jolt markets worldwide on Friday and unsettle Western capitals By the time the BBC had called the result at dawn in London Friday the pound had already plummeted to its lowest level against the dollar in decadesThe vote is perhaps the most dramatic to date in a wave of populist and nationalist uprisings occurring on both_sides of the Atlantic that are overturning traditional notions of what is politically possibleFor months the political and economic elite had looked on with growing apprehension as Britain flirted with a choice popularly known as Brexit that experts had warned could lead to global recession and a rip in the Western alliance The vote could also lead to Scottish secession a broader EU unraveling and the fall of Prime_Minister David Camerons governmentBut most analysts had predicted this pragmatically minded country would ultimately back away from the move and opt to keep Britain in an organization regarded as a pillar of the global economic and political order Instead a majority of British voters heeded the call of pro-Brexit campaigners to liberate the nation from what many here regard as an oppressive Brussels bureaucracy that enables mass migration into the countryLet June the 23rd go down in our history as our independence day cried a jubilant Nigel Farage a firebrand anti-EU leader in a 4 am celebration All around him leave campaigners clinked pints of beer and cheered their improbable victoryWhen polls closed six hours earlier Farage had all but conceded defeat saying he believed remain had won But as results poured in through Thursday night and into the early hours of Friday the remain camp was increasingly despairingAbout a third of results had yet to be counted as of 4 am local time But the BBC reported that leave had taken an insurmountable leadThe results came after 15 hours of voting from the remote Scottish isles to the tip of Gibraltar The outcome revealed vast divides with massive victory margins for remain in thriving metropolitan centers such as London and equally resounding victories for leave in small towns rural areas and struggling post-industrial cities As local authorities announced results markets swung wildly between optimism that the country would stay in the preferred choice of investors and pessimism that Britain had just voted to get outAfter initially rising to a 2016 high the pound plunged in international trading as jittery investors prepared for a scenario that had not been priced into market calculationsAs the hours ticked by there was a dawning realization that Britain could become the first country to leave the 28-member EU In television interviews remain supporters looked stricken and predicted catastropheGod help our country tweeted Paddy Ashdown the former Liberal Democrat leader and an outspoken EU advocateThe outcome will rattle officials in Washington President_Obama had made a high-profile plea for Britain to stay Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump who was in Scotland on Friday to open a golf course backed Brexit Although Britain may not actually leave the EU for years Thursdays vote fires the starting gun on what is widely expected to be a messy proceeding as Britain and EU officials begin untangling the vast web of connections between this island nation and the other 27 members of the blocThursdays outcome will be a crippling blow to Cameron who had campaigned vigorously for Britain to stay in the EU and had cast the referendum as a choice between an insular intolerant little England and an outward-looking pluralistic Great BritainHaving failed to convince a majority of voters he is expected to come under intense pressure to resignCameron initially promised the referendum in 2013 in a bid to unite the country and especially his Conservative Party behind a common stance on an issue that has divided public opinion here for decadesAt the time he may have expected a relatively easy victory But the campaign soon went off script as Justice Secretary Michael Gove and then-London Mayor Boris Johnson friends and sparring partners of Camerons since his days at Oxford both declared in February their intention to campaign for outThe populist-minded Johnson will now be seen as the most likely successor to Cameron if the prime_minister is pushed from his perch at 10 Downing StreetI think the Boris Johnson momentum will be unstoppable said Steven Fielding a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham Cameron will try to find a dignified exit But its not clear how long the backbenchers will give him to do thatThe leave campaign found a compelling rallying cry with its call for voters to Take Back Control a slogan that resonated among an electorate ill at ease with record levels of immigration much of it from Europe under the EUs free-movement policyPolls suggested that leave alienated some voters with its reliance on what critics saw as increasingly nativist rhetoric That was particularly true after the killing last_week of pro-EU lawmaker Jo Cox a murder that appeared to awaken a passion in remain supporters that had been previously lackingA leave lead last_week in the polls diminished and the race turned into a dead heat Surveys released Thursday as Britons votesdhad shown remain with a clear edge results that cheered investors and boosted markets across Europe and AsiaBut as with last years British general election the polls were badly wrong apparently unable to capture the mood of an increasingly defiant electorateThe prevailing tone of the campaign on either side was fear and loathing with neither venturing for long into hope or aspirationThat spirit mirrored the angry mood of voters across the Atlantic in the United_States and surprised even close observers of a nation that sees itself as deeply pragmatic and rationalNotions of Britain as a deferential consensual society at ease with itself have been thrown out the window Fielding said This campaign has revealed a very profound mistrust among a substantial segment of society toward conventional political authority The EU became a lightning rod for mistrust of politics more broadlyThe vote split the country along essential lines Old versus young Provincial versus metropolitan Scotland versus England Native-born Britons versus immigrants As the first votes were cast nationwide with the often-variable British weather running the gamut from a torrential downpour in London to sunny clear skies in Scotland anxiety was the prevailing moodHilary Clarke a 45-year-old stay-at-home mom was the first to vote at a southwest London polling station She said she would use her stubby pencil to check remain on her ballotIf I had been confident I wouldnt be standing in the rain at 7 in the morning she said as she sheltered beneath a colorful umbrella The reason Im first in the queue is Im_going straight to the airport to go to Barcelona and I may not return if vote goes the wrong wayClarke said she could not understand the logic of those pushing for leaveI can see that sometimes it seems we are hemorrhaging money to the EU she said But at the same_time we seem to get so much more back than we give Even if youre disagreeing with whats said at the table its better to have a place at itBut for leave voters Britains four decades of membership in the European_Union and its precursors have only dragged the country downAndreas Hajialexandrou a 48-year-old businessman of Greek Cypriot heritage said the country could simply not withstand the impact of record numbers of immigrants from elsewhere in EuropeThere are pressures on local services I speak to our local [doctors] and they are just swamped he said The question is how long can you support that level of immigrationInside a dark chemistry lab in a derelict old building Pvt Shane Diaz gingerly drew 13 milliliters of an unknown brown liquid from a glass flask up into a syringeBreathing through a gas mask that made him sound like Darth Vader he was careful not to spill a drop as he put it into a sample jar Who knew what chemical_weapons the North_Koreans had been making hereRemove the tubing from the syringe and be mindful of the needle it might come out Sgt Tyler Lawrence said from behind him And when you get the tubing out kill itEverything had to be done exactly by the book These samples could be used to prosecute Kim_Jong Un and his cronies with war crimes before the International Criminal Court Or at_least thats what the American soldiers were training forThe US and South_Korean militaries are staging their an eight-week exercise involving everything from amphibious landing exercises on southern beaches to computer-simulated decapitation strikes aimed_at taking out the leaders of a certain regime just to the northAbout 17000 American troops and 300000 South_Korean personnel are taking part in computer-simulated exercises which end this weekend and field drills that continue through the end of April The allies scenario is clear to prepare to go into North_Korea after the regime in Pyongyang collapses or after it orders a suicidal invasion of the SouthThe exercises come at a particularly tense time on the Korean_Peninsula with punishment for the Norths recent nuclear_test and missile_launch biting at the same timePyongyang has been making its unhappiness with both developments loud and clear threatening preemptive strikes or claiming some major technological advance on a daily basisThe DPRKs army will reduce all bases and strongholds of the US and south Korean warmongers for provocation and aggression into ashes in a moment without giving them any breathing spell the state-run Korean_Central News_Agency said in a recent commentary about the exercises using the official abbreviation for North_Korea While North_Korea has been threatening to use its nuclear_weapons a key component of the drills involves dealing with chemical or biological agents About 700 soldiers 100 of them South_Korean are taking part in a series of 28 drills over 18 daysIn addition to its nuclear_weapons program the Kim regime is thought to possess chemical_weapons including nerve agents such as sarin gas that it can make domesticallyEvidence suggests that North_Korea has significant quantities and varieties of chemical_weapons Joseph S Bermudez an expert on North_Koreas defense It also has to a lesser extent the ability to employ these weapons worldwide using unconventional methods of deliveryThe use of chemical_weapons in Syrias civil_war has shown how devastating this form of warfare can be and has refocused some attention on the Norths presumed programsAt a largely unused army base north of Seoul close to the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas soldiers were practicing what to do if they came across a clandestine chemical_weapons lab in North KoreaAt a drill Monday soldiers in full combat gear from an Army unit based at Fort Hood Tex stormed the dilapidated building chosen because it was similar to what American soldiers might actually encounter in North_Korea and swept through the dark rooms guns drawn In the building they found 55-gallon drums with liquid on top empty munitions shells and a filling station a chemical lab with a sign reading quality inspection in Korean on the outside A sharp odor pervaded the space (it was Bengay that the soldiers had smeared on the walls for verisimilitude)Its more real here for sure Its a real-life scenario said 1st Lt Jonathan OConnell who had come in from Fort Hood for the exercises There are multiple known sites that are literally hours away from here by footSeeing it was clearly a chemical_weapons site the soldiers called in specialists from the US Armys 2nd Infantry Division the only division with a full chemical battalion and the only chemical_weapons team stationed outside the United StatesEnter Pvt Orin Johnson the team leader with his notebooks and camera Pvt Charles Kimiaga with a bucket filled with plastic sheeting and glass jars and Diaz with a scanner that started beeping immediately They were decked out in Mopp 4 gear the highest level of protective suits with gloves and boot covers taped onto their suitsUnder the close inspection of Lawrence their evaluator the three slowly moved through the rooms with their vapor detector radioing in their findings along the way It looked like a cross between CSI and Breaking BadOur guys need to be able to identify whats going on and understand whats on the site and understand whats there said Lt Col Adam Hilburgh the battalion commander We use the current intelligence picture to tailor our training to thatIf they were to actually find chemical or biological agents in North_Korea the soldiers would have to take samples and keep them secure so they could be introduced at the International Criminal Court Hilburgh saidIn the chemical lab Lawrence told the men to get out their kill bucket They promptly set_up a yellow bucket bag and poured in powder to kill whatever liquid was inside the flasksLawrence was not impressed with the time it was taking The [chemical] process is still ongoing he barked Youre assisting the enemyThe trio set about putting samples into glass jars 10 milliliters or about two teaspoons was all the court would need Lawrence said and analyzing them in the scannerIt turned out it was lewisite a blister agent (Anti-lewisite pills were found in another room along with the supposed North_Korean gas masks)The soldiers prepared to package it up and ship out the liquids before moving steadily up the difficulty ladderNext on their training list going underground to practice working in tunnels containing radioactive material and very little oxygenSecretary of State John_F Kerry and Chinas foreign_minister agreed Wednesday to move ahead with a UN resolution condemning North_Korea for its but they appeared as far apart as ever on how far to push PyongyangThe United_States says any additional UN action against the North is likely to include expanded sanctions Beijing a key ally of North_Koreas at the nuclear_test this month but has not indicated whether it will endorse further pressureAs a permanent UN_Security Council member China could use its veto power to block any measuresAfter a five-hour meeting between Kerry and Foreign Minister Wang Yi the two diplomats appeared before reporters with tension written across their faces Wang drummed his fingers on the side of his lectern as a grim-faced Kerry excoriated the actions of North_Korea and its erratic leader Kim_Jong UnKerry used unusually forceful language about the dangers posed by Pyongyang Wang repeatedly mentioned the need for stability on the Korean_Peninsula While both agreed that more sanctions are warranted they said the details would have to be resolved in talks at the UN_Security Council in coming days Kim_Jong Uns actions are reckless and they are dangerous Kerry said of the leader whose regime has been backed by China for six decades Whether or not he achieved the explosion of a hydrogen weapon is not what makes the difference Its that he is tryingSix-party talks also involving South_Korea Russia and Japan began in 2003 but failed to make headway North_Korea conducted its first nuclear_test in 2006 and finally quit the talks in 2009 It has since conducted three tests the most recent on Jan6China has voted in the UN_Security Council to sanction North_Korea over its previous nuclear_tests and it has condemned the latest one But Wang made clear that China is prepared to go only so farSanctions are not an end in themselves he said Our goal should be to bring the nuclear issue on the Korea Peninsula back to the negotiating track Kerry declined to be specific about what sectors might be affected by sanctions But he suggested they might include trade involving the flow of goods and services between North_Korea and China shipping and aviation as well as resource exchanges involving coal and other fuelThere are many different ways we think in which non-punitive to the people of North_Korea but nevertheless effective steps can be taken he said Kerry came to Beijing as part of an effort by US officials to persuade the Chinese government to press Pyongyang to give up its nuclear program He said China has a special role to play because it serves as the Norths lifeline providing food fuel and a conduit for most of its trade and financial transactionsIn Beijing analysts and state_media argued that pushing North_Korea further could make it more aggressive or hasten the regimes collapse propelling a stream of refugees into China and potentially installing a US client state on its border Washington is exacerbating the situation they saidBut Kerry made clear that the strategy of relying on Beijing to prod Pyongyang needs to change He said North_Koreas stated intention of acquiring intercontinental_ballistic missiles threatens the United_States which he said will never accept North_Korea as a nuclear-armed stateThe United_States will take all necessary steps to defend the American people and to honor our security commitments to allies in the region he said I say that making clear we do not want to raise military tensions we are not seeking additional steps other than UN_Security Council_resolutions but we will not walk away from any actions necessary to achieve the goalKerry also held out a carrot to North_Korea saying it would get sanctions relief economic help energy and food aid plus direct humanitarian assistance if it ends its nuclear programYet even as he stood alongside Wang after their lengthy meeting which extended into lunch Kerry seemed to be pleading with China to do more to rein in its neighbor noting that China was one of five countries that negotiated an agreement to trim Irans nuclear programNuclear-related sanctions against Iran were lifted this month once Iran pared down its uranium stockpiles and disabled or mothballed parts of its nuclear facilitiesWith all due respect more significant and impactful sanctions were put in place against Iran which did_not have a nuclear_weapon than against North_Korea which does he saidIn contrast Wangs words were laced with reluctanceOur position will not be swayed by specific events or the temporary mood of the moment he saidWang said China is committed to the denuclearization of the Korean_Peninsula but he said two other principles are equally important The commitment to uphold peace and stability The commitment to resolve the issue through dialogue and consultationIn the past Washington has used less confrontational language than Kerry employed Wednesday hoping China would use its clout to pressure North_Korea on its own But in recent_weeks US officials have shown signs that their patience is wearing thinYanmei Xie senior China analyst with the International Crisis Group in Beijing said US officials may have recognized the limits of their softer approachNow they appear to be trying a different approach raising the stakes for China of what the US sees as inaction over North_Korea she said I_think the US is not pretending anymoreChinas foreign_minister has a plan to ease tensions in East_Asia North_Korea should stop testing missiles and the United_States and South_Korea should stop joint military_exercises he said WednesdayThe comment was delivered at a news_conference in Beijing two days after North_Korea test-fired four_missiles and the United_States and South_Korea began deploying a new missile_defense system raising regional tension and renewing about Asia policy under President TrumpChinas suggestion is as a first step for North_Korea to suspend nuclear activity and for the US and South_Korea to also suspend large-scale military drills Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said This he said could get all sides back to the negotiating tableWang warned that the United_States and North_Korea appear headed for a collision The two sides are like two accelerating trains coming toward each other with neither side willing to give way he saidThe question is Are the two sides really ready for a head-on collision Our priority now is to flash the red light and apply the brakes on both trains What Wang proposed Wednesday is not new North_Korea has suspension for suspension many times and the United_States has balkedBut this is the first time it has been raised under Trump presenting some new possibilities said John Delury an assistant professor at Seouls Yonsei University We dont_know what Trump is going to do about North_Korea Delury said There is a policy review underway now and it looks like all options are on the table At the heart of all this is a question about Beijings role in relations among China North_Korea South_Korea Japan and the United_States particularly as Washington charts a new foreign_policy under TrumpIn February North_Korea tested a solid-fuel_rocket that it claimed was part of an_intercontinental ballistic_missile capable of hitting the United_States The country was then linked to the killing in Malaysia of ruler Kim_Jong Uns_half brother who had been under Chinese protectionOn Monday as Chinas National Peoples Congress opened in Beijing and US-South Korea military_exercises got underway Pyongyang launched four_missiles target practice it saidAll sides have condemned North_Koreas actions What they cannot agree on is what to do nextChina says the conflict should be solved by the United_States and North_Korea But Washington has long argued that the conflict cannot be resolved without more help from ChinaNorth Korea and China were once as close as lips and teeth as communist revolutionary leader Mao Zedong put it Although they are still technically allies Wang resurrected Maos lips and teeth line Wednesday China is frustrated by North_Koreas nuclear theatrics and exhausted by its economic woesAfter Februarys rocket launch Beijing closed loopholes in an existing effort to curb North_Korean coal imports a sector seen as a financial lifeline for Kims regimeChinese experts insist that Beijing has few remaining options when it comes to Pyongyang mostly because North_Korea sees the development of its nuclear program as the only way to protect against the United_States the North would rather have no coal or no cash than cease to exist the theory goes Even if China stops oil aid to North_Korea it will still not give up developing nuclear_weapons saidYang Xiyu a senior fellow at the China Institute of International_Studies in Beijing Indeed despite their many differences Beijing and Pyongyang share a belief that the presence of US troops in South_Korea is the root of regional conflict a view highlighted this week when China lashed out at the United_States and South_Korea over the deployment of a new antimissile systemThe United_States and South_Korea say theTerminal High_Altitude Area_Defense (THAAD)_system is necessary to shoot down North_Korean missiles China believes it could be used to spy on Chinese airspace Although Trumps precise plans are unknown his previous comments on North_Korea suggest that he thinks it is up to China to play a bigger role The THAAD_deployment however could make it tougher to get Beijing on boardExperts said Trump seems unlikely for now to accept Wangs proposalThere is very little possibility that they will get back to talks said Zhang Liangui a North_Korea expert_at the Communist Partys Central Party SchoolThat means the next move will probably come from Washington and depend on Trump We just hope that the US can solve this Zhang said Congcong_Zhang and Jin Xin contributed to this reportTheres a chill in the air in Dandong these days and not just because winter is comingA steady stream of trucks still rumble across the single-lane bridge from China to North_Korea from dawn until dusk every day and North_Koreans can still be seen in the streets and in the restaurants of this grimy border city the commercial gateway to the isolated stateBut tradinghas become significantly harder in recent_weeks a dozen people involved indoing businesswith North_Korea said in interviews the result of a double-pronged attempt by Beijing to communicate its anger with the regime in PyongyangEverythings become tougher since September a Korean Chinese factory owner who employs North_Korean workers here told The Washington_Post This crackdownis because of the missile and nuclear_tests and it doesnt look like its going to blow overThis news might be slightly more encouraging than official Washington has been expecting but only slightly Although China is annoyed with North_Korea its primary consideration keeping the regime afloat has not changedIndeed the chillhere is partly because of the tough international sanctions_imposed in March after North_Korea conducted its fourth_nuclear test They are aimed_at cutting off North Koreasability to earn hard currency through coal exports and shippingBut an equal or even bigger influence is the surprise detention of a prominent Dandong business executive a member of the Communist Party no less who stands accused of helping North_Korea dodge sanctions and obtain materials for its weapons programWhen business people hear this kind of story of course we feel very constrained and it makes us very cautious a South_Korean businessman trading in this area said on the condition of anonymity The atmosphere is so tense that none of the business executives interviewed were willing to be publicly identified even as they insisted that everything was aboveboardBusiness is down but no one knows how long that will last Even now there are plenty of ambiguous signs The annual trade fair here was canceled yet coal exports from North_Korea are breaking records China holds the lever and its intentions can be only speculated uponFor more_than a decade the international_community led by the United_States has tried to inflict economic pain on North_Korea in an effort to convince it that the costs of pursuing a nuclear_weapons program outweigh any benefitsIncreasingly tight rounds of sanctions have however clearly failed to change the regimes calculus North_Koreas leader Kim_Jong Un has ordered and dozens of missile_launches this year apparently aiming to produce a nuclear_weapon capable of reaching the US mainland Sanctions are the only tool that the international_community really has given that there is no appetite for engagement and even less for military actionIn March the UN_Security Council passed a resolution that among other tough measures ordered mandatory inspections of all cargo going into North_Korea and banned North_Korean exports of coal iron and iron ore unless they are for livelihood purposesBut with almost all North_Korean trade going through China and Dandong specifically sanctions are only as effective as Beijing wants them to be Beijing doesnt want the collapse of its impoverished nuclear-armed neighbor and it certainly doesnt want the 28000 American troops stationed in South_Korea to be able to move right up to the peninsulas border with ChinaChina has a permanent interest in keeping North_Korea afloat no matter what said Andrei Lankov a Korea expert who teaches at Kookmin University in Seoul You will never be able to persuade China to do something differentAs a result this frontier There were alwaysofficials willing to turn a blind eye middlemen brokering deals in the shadows entrepreneurs looking to gain a foothold in what they hoped would becomean increasingly open marketSanctions were a matter for faraway Beijing and even farther-away Washington But theres a shift in the wind And the question now is After the nuclear_tests and missile_launches including three while China was hosting the Group of 20 summit meeting in September is President_Xi Jinping angry enough to inflict a little more pain on KimWhat was once a black-and-white picture China supported sanctions in principle but not in practice has become a complicated gray oneThere is plenty of activity going on here Dozens of trucks laden with steel rebar and sacks of cement line up on the road outside the customs house every day waiting to cross into North KoreaAt the main logistics center everything from tangerines to a Mercedes-Benz SUV without tags was being prepared for export on a recent day The customs process has become a little more complicated said a North_Korean driver with a truck full of tiles But if you pay its okaySolar panels and generators continue to be popular and there are still tens of thousands of North_Korean laborers here And trade in coal which makes up about 40 percent of North_Koreas exports hit a record in AugustThat is because China has a different interpretation of the livelihood exception said Western diplomats involved in the process While the international_community has focused on the ban China is focusing on the exception Diplomats in Beijing are highly doubtful that the Chinese government has any intention to seriously punish North_Korea expressing frustration at the coal figures and skepticism about reports of tougher times on the borderIn the wake of Septembers nuclear_test the United_States has been pushing the United_Nations to close the loophole but China has resistedChina still believes it should not hurt ordinary people in North_Korea said Zhang Tuosheng director of research at the China Foundation for International and Strategic StudiesThe main problem is that the gap_between the US and China on North_Korea is so huge Zhang said I dont_think China would agree to close the livelihood exception That would damage ordinary peopleBut one joint action even if it wasgrudging has had a tangible impactIn September the US Justice_Department and its chief_executive Ma Xiaohong accusing her of using the company as a front to channel American dollars to North_Korea helping it to finance its nuclear_weapons program It was the first time Washington had used secondary sanctions to punish a Chinese entity for helping North KoreaChinese provincial authorities while saying their actions were

stopped in her tracks has sent shivers through DandongMa was a city official and the government doesnt usually mess with people like that Its had a very serious impact here the Korean Chinese factory owner saidThe South_Korean businessman echoed this sentiment I personally think that the Hongxiang case has had a bigger impact than sanctions The vibe I get is that people are being cautiousIn interviews businessmen detailed an increasingly difficult operatingenvironment Last year I did about 10 big deals construction equipment automobiles but this year Ive done none said a Korean Chinese intermediary who brokers deals for investors on both_sides of the borderThe actions and specifically those against Hongxiang have riled some localsDandong people are feeling insulted like the Americans are bullying us said a man who said his name was Wang and who drives business people around town This was business approved by the governments in China and North_Korea You can link any material to nuclear development if you want toPeople involved in the Hongxiang case warn against seeing Chinas response as the start of a broader crackdown with one saying that getting Beijing to act was exceptionally difficultBut recent evidence shows Lankov said that Beijing has decided to enforce and not enforce sanctions in a new controlled wayThis is all being done at the central-government level assuming that low-level officials are difficult to control Lankov said They need it to be planned and measuredChina will always put its interests first he saidThey want to have the situation under control They will keep North_Korea afloat but the central government in Beijing will decide which buttons to push and whenHow long will this chill lastBusiness executives here said they hope that it wont continue much longer Whenever there are specific events China shows that they have tightened up for a short period But after some time it goes back to business as usual said one of the

North_Korea overand the assassination of Kim_Jong Uns_half brother in MalaysiaKim Jong_Nam had been hosted and protected by China for many years and his murder if proved to be conducted on Pyongyangs orders would be seen as a direct affront to Beijing experts said China has also come under significant international pressure to do more to rein in North_Koreas nuclear_weapons and ballistic_missile programs whileChinese President_Xi Jinping is believed to have become increasingly irritated by Kim_Jong Uns behaviorNorth Korea is Chinas fourth-biggest supplier of coal Although China announced in April that it would ban North_Korean coal imports to comply with UNsanctions it made exceptions for deliveries intended for the peoples well-being and not connected to North Koreasmissile programsIn practice that exception was the cover for coal to continue to flow across the border in huge quantities with imports of non-lignite coal up 145percent last_year to 225 million metric tons (248 million US tons)But in a sign that Beijings patience was running out it rejected a coal shipment from North_Korea worth about $1million Monday the day after the test of an intermediate-range ballistic_missile South_Koreas Yonhap_News Agency reportedChina has long been reluctant to do anything that might threaten the stability of the North_Korean regime mainly because it fears that the reunification of the Korean_Peninsula could bring South_Korea an American ally that hosts US troops right up to its borderGiven that a total ban on coal imports could be destabilizing it remains to be seen how firmly the pledge will be carried_out But Pyongyangs unwillingness to consider Chinas interests has badly damaged or even destroyed trust between the long-standing alliesChina still places a premium on stability but Xi_Jinping is growing more and more frustrated with Kim_Jong Un saidPaul Haenle director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing adding that the missile test and the assassination were seen as serious offensesBeijing took the assassination as a direct affront to China Xi is less willing to tolerate these provocations he said China is putting a squeeze on its economic lifeline to send a message to PyongyangWang Weimin a professor at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs at Fudan University in Shanghai said sympathy for North_Koreas national_security concerns had disappeared in Beijing and blood ties between the countries had been broken as it became clear that the regime could not be tamedIf we choose an ally that cant be tamed we might become the biggest loser he said Thats why we are more and more strict with North_Korea Now self-interest is central We wont pay attention to North_Koreas interests anymorePresident Trump hasalso called on China to put more pressure on North_Korea to stop its nuclear_weapons program and the subject may have come up during a telephone conversation he had with Xi earlier_this monthChina hastotal control over North_Korea Trump said in an interview on Fox & Friends in early January And China should solve that problem And if they dont solve the problem we should make trade very difficult for China The UN_Security Council condemned North_Koreas latest missile test Monday and urged members to redouble efforts to enforce sanctions That appeal came after an emergency meeting in New_York called by the United_States Japan and South_Korea Jin Xin contributed to this reportThe United_States rebuffed a proposal from China to apply the brakes to an escalating standoff with North_Korea saying positive action was required before it would engage with the irresponsible Kim_Jong UnChina was trying to mediate the rising tensions in East_Asia which pit its once-close ally North_Korea against the United_States and its evolving foreign_policy under President TrumpThe North_Koreans have given us enough reason to think how irresponsible they are with little cause to believe that were dealing with a rational person on this said Nikki Haley the US ambassador to the United_Nations Speaking to reporters Wednesday after an emergency UN_Security Council meeting on North_Korea she added We have to see some sort of positive action by North_Korea before we can take them seriouslyThere has been no official Chinese reaction to the snubChinas foreign_minister Wang Yi Wednesday to suspend missile_tests in return for a suspension of US-South Korea military exercisesWang compared the United_States and North_Korea to two accelerating trains coming toward each other with neither side willing to give wayHe cast China as a railway worker or signalman trying to keep things on track though US critics argue that China is not a neutralsignalman but Pyongyangs patronA suspension for suspension deal Wang argued was key to preserving peace and getting back to the negotiating tableWhat he proposed has been pitched before by North_Korea and rejected by the United_States But with the Trump administration still fleshing out its foreign_policy some experts wondered whether the proposal had a shotIt did_not Haley said the administration is still deciding how to proceed I can tell_you were not ruling anything out and were considering every option thats on the table she saidThey may need to move quickly The early months of the Trump presidency have coincided with a surge of tension in AsiaIn February North_Korea a solid-fuel_rocket that it claimed was part of an_intercontinental ballistic_missile capable of hitting the United StatesSoon after the country was linked to the in Malaysia of Kim_Jong Uns_half brother Kim_Jong Nam who had been under Chinese protectionThen on Monday as US-South Korean military_exercises got underway Pyongyang launching four_missiles that landed in waters off the Japanese coastThe same night the United_States and South_Korea pushed ahead with the long-planned deployment of an antimissile_system that China strongly opposesAt the center of this complex and evolving conflict are questions about Chinas ties to North_Korea and the US role in East Asian affairs particularly under TrumpChina and North_Korea see the presence of US troops in South_Korea as the root of regional conflict and they wantthe United_States to acknowledge or address thisThe United_States and South_Korea are focused on the North_Korean threatThey say THAAD is a defensive system designed to shoot down North_Korean missilesBut China believes that THAAD could be used to spy on Chinese airspace and sees the system as evidence of US military meddling in Asian affairs After the deployment on Monday Chinas Foreign_Ministry warned of unspecified consequences for the United_States and South_Korea and has continued to target South_Korean business interestsThe United_States meanwhile has pushed for China to play a more assertive role in reining in North KoreaWith Chinese leaders outraged over THAAD the for the Trump administration will be getting them to abandon their patronage of North_Korea Jin Xin contributed to this reportIn a US election cycle where it often seems that nobody agrees on anything the presidential front-runners appear to share one article of faith China is the key to fixing North KoreaAsked how they would handle Pyongyang and have all mentioned the need to push or pressure China to do moreNow come reports that China and the United_States are making on a UN resolution to tighten sanctions on North_Korea On Wednesday diplomats at the UN_Security Council said the two permanent members of the body have reached an agreement on the draft resolution that could be presented to the full council for approval within days Last week President_Obama targeting banks and trading companies many of them Chinese linked to North_Koreas

be good news for the Obama_administration a diplomatic ray of light amid the gloom in the region over disputes in It could also hurt North_Korean leader Kim_Jong Un and his cronies experts sayBut another tougher round of sanctions is far from the cure-all that some politicians imagine China and the United_States remain at odds over what the new rules are supposed to achieve Everyone is talking_about sanctions said Stephan Haggard a North_Korea expert_at the University of California at San Diego But we have to ask Sanctions to what endAsking China to act on North_Korea makes sense Beijing and Pyongyang are frenemies really and it is no secret that North_Koreas economy is sustained in large part by trade across the Chinese borderThe latest US proposal calls for a more aggressive targeting of the firms that keep Kim in business including secondary sanctions against companies that do business with those firmsThe strategy is designed to hit Kim where it hurts said Sung-Yoon Lee a Korea specialist at Tufts Universitys Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy The North_Korean people are uniquely isolated and cut_off but the regime is not It depends on cash flow depends on international financial transactions and depends on the dollar system to feed the eliteThis approach has worked before Nearly a decade ago by a Macau-based institution that handled North_Korean money the United_States cut_off Pyongyangs cash supply and brought North_Korea back to nuclear negotiations (Those talks later fell apart)Tong Zhao an expert on nuclear disarmament at Beijings Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy said the measures being formulated are not just about finance but also are an effort by the United_States to put more pressure on ChinaBeijing has long opposed unilateral sanctions and is wary of any move that might hurt its economy or cause instability across the border At the same_time it is increasingly frustrated by North_Korea and worried about a That makes Beijing more receptive to sanctions that or so Washington hopesAfter Obama signed the new sanctions legislation last_week a South_Korean newspaper that ICBC a major Chinese bank was curbing its business in North_Korea according to a branch near the border The report was of a potential shift in Chinas strategyBut calls to several banks in Dandong a key hub at the China-North Korea border suggest that the policy direction is far from clear Reached by phone workers at Bank of China China Merchants Bank and Bank of Dandong branches said they no_longer did business with North_Korea An employee at China Construction Bank said it was doing business with North_Korea but would not go into detailsNorth Korea watchers warned against seeing the ICBC anecdote or any branchs statement as proof of a real push to stop cross-border transactions Weve seen this movie before China starts to enforce some sanctions and then a month later they loosen up again said Bonnie Glaser a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International_Studies in WashingtonThe Chinese might be looking for some things to do to ease the pressure that the US is putting on them she saidAlthough China says it supports UN_Security Council_resolutions on North_Korea it has a bad enforcement record according to UN and reportingThe North_Korean regime has deep connections to various sectors of Chinas economy A real or rumored crackdown at the big banks is unlikely to prevent smaller banks from moving money across the border let alone curb the trade in resources experts saidIts inconvenient as hell for North_Koreans to move cash across borders but this relationship is way bigger than banking said Adam Cathcart who studies China and North_Korea at the University of Leeds in BritainReached by telephone a man who gave his name as Mr Han who works at a Chinese company that imports minerals from North_Korea dismissed the idea of tighter sanctions with a profanity He said he moves his money through local banks or in cash without any problem I can basically do anything he saidAnother mineral trader who identified himself only as Mr Cai said that US sanctions would not hurt him but that UN measures could make a dent if China chose to enforce themBoth said business is down because of a slump in commodity prices not as a result of politicsHaggard the North_Korea expert_at the University of California at San Diego said the economic slump plus sanctions could increase pressure on Pyongyang But that does_not mean a lasting solution is in sight he saidEven with China on board there is no quick fix Liu Liu Gu Jinglu and Xu Jing contributed to this reportChina warned Tuesday of consequences for South_Korea and the United_States over the deployment of a US antimissile_system further raising regional tension and posing a challenge to the Trump administrationThe stern words came a day after North_Korea launched four_missiles that landed off the Japanese coast an exercise the North_Korean government said designed to practice for in JapanAmerican and South_Korean officials say the continuing missile_launches by the North_Koreans demonstrate why the new antimissile_system is necessary as a defense against Kim_Jong Uns_regime The US military began the Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defense_(THAAD) system to South_Korea on MondayBut Beijing as a threat to the Chinese military and evidence of US meddling in East Asian affairs I want to emphasize that we firmly oppose the deployment of THAAD Geng_Shuang a spokesman for Chinas Foreign_Ministry said Tuesday at a daily news briefing in Beijing We will resolutely take necessary measures to defend our security interestsAll consequences entailed from this will be borne by the US and the Republic of KoreaGeng did_not provide details on what consequences are in store for either country although South_Korean officials said they expected retaliatory moves against companies doing business in ChinaThe

was inviting further international opprobrium China was angered by the Feb13 murder which the Malaysians say employed VX nerve agent and some analysts suggest the North_Korean missile_launch was secondarily designed to provoke BeijingIn Washington State_Department spokesman Mark Toner reiterated US criticism of North_Korea and the missile_launches Theyre increasingly becoming a pariah through this kind of behavior he said Were pursuing tougher and tougher sanctions but were also looking at other means to make that message clear to themChinas Foreign_Ministry did_not specify any actions against the United_States on Tuesday but Beijings displeasure over the antimissile_system marked an abrupt change in tone after a generally cautious approach until now toward the new American presidentAlthough some Chinese initially welcomed the idea of Donald Trumps presidency convinced a seasoned businessman would take a practical approach to politics Trumps early moves on Taiwan Since the inauguration Chinese officials have taken a careful approach playing up the positive and playing down areas of disagreement including Trump administration comments on the South China Sea That is

has taken aim atSouth Korean businesses in China Beginning on Friday it has been warning would-be Chinese_tourists against booking trips to South_Korea Although some travel agencies have already stopped selling tickets and tours to South_Korea Chinas National Tourism Administration has officially ordered travel agencies to stop all tour groups and cruise ships by March15 the South_Korean

tourism representative spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to give information to the news mediaThree large Chinese travel agencies confirmed the order from the Tourism Administration Two said they have already stopped selling packages the other said it would stop selling by March 15After Lotte helped the South_Korean government secure land for THAAD it was denounced and threatened in Chinas Communist Party-controlled press Nearly two dozen of the companys retail outlets were subsequently shut_down by Chinese authorities for alleged safety violations

salvo this week unsealing charges_against three former Trump campaign aides thought to have engaged in a medley of wrongdoingThe cases he revealed legal_analysts said indicate he is pursuing an extensive probe that will explore both personal wrongdoing of those connected with President Trump and possible efforts campaign officials took to work with Russia to influence the 2016 electionCollusion the word Trump often uses to describe Muellers case even as he asserts such a thing never happened is not itself a crime and Muellers_team will probably have to sort through unseemly political dealings to determine whether a law was broken legal_analysts said In his first public charges though Mueller offered a hint of the direction he might take Former campaign foreign_policy adviser_George Papadopoulos for example pleaded_guilty to making a false_statement to FBI investigators who asked about his contacts with foreigners claiming to have high-level Russian connectionsOf particular note he falsely described his interactions with a London-based professor claiming to have connections to high-level Russian officials who purportedly had dirt on Hillary_Clinton in the form of thousands of emailsPapadopoulos said his interactions with the professor thought to be occurred before he joined the campaign and did_not amount to much In fact the professor told him about the emails in April_2016 after his role on the campaign was made public and the two were involved in extensive discussions about a possible meeting between the Trump campaign and Russian officials according to Papadopouloss plea agreement The conversation about emails is possibly a critical piece of evidence legal_analysts said That is because one charge that investigators might try to substantiate against those higher in the Trump campaign is a conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse ActIf Mueller can find evidence that members of Trumps team conspired in Russias hacking effort by directing it or aiding in another way they might face criminal charges legal_analysts said Papadopouloss plea says that he discussed some of his efforts to broker a meeting with the Russians with other more senior Trump campaign officials although some seemed to treat him warily Theres a significant difference between the Russians having dirt and offering that dirt and someone asking the Russians to commit an illegal act to obtain that dirt said Jacob Frenkel a white-collar lawyer at Dickinson Wright who previously worked in the now-defunct Office of the Independent Counsel The latter likely would be prosecutable and probably as a conspiracy to commit a computer crime or as a computer crimePapadopouloss conversation about emails of Clinton took_place a month after and well before Also it was not until June_2016 that that the Democratic_National Committees computer network had been breachedBut at that time it was well known that Clinton had deleted tens of thousands of emails she deemed personal from her private server Those messages were of great interest to Republicans who believed they might show something nefariousIt was unclear to what emails the professor was referring or if he truly had access to any messages damaging to Clinton Jonathan Biran a former federal_prosecutor now in private practice at Biran Kelly said Muellers_team is probably asking What did people within the campaign know about how those emails had been obtained and whether they had reason to believe they were illegally obtainedAaron Zelinsky a lawyer in the special_counsels office said at Papadopouloss plea hearing which was held in secret earlier_this month that the foreign_policy advisers case was a small part of a large-scale ongoing investigation Though Papadopoulos was first arrested in July the court kept his case sealed for months after prosecutors asserted that making it public would significantly undermine his ability to serve as a proactive cooperatorFormer Trump campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort and Rick_Gates his longtime business_partner were charged in a separate 12-count_indictment in connection with their work advising a Russia-friendly political party in Ukraine While their charges do not directly relate to their roles on the Trump campaign legal_analysts said the case could offer a preview of how Mueller plans to proceedAmong many other counts including conspiracy to launder money and failing to file reports of foreign_bank accounts Manafort and Gates were charged with carrying out a conspiracy against the United_States Specifically the special_counsel alleged that they worked to defraud the Justice and Treasury departments as they tried to hide their incomes and lobbying work for Ukrainian interestsMueller could be working to convince Manafort and Gates to cooperate and he could also be trying to send a message to others in Trumps orbit that he will leave no stone unturned and that those who deceive investigators will be charged legal_analysts saidBut Mueller also could be signaling a charge he could pursue in connection with the coordination case a conspiracy to defraud the United_States by coordinating with RussiaCollusion is not a crime but basically the criminal equivalent is conspiracy said former federal_prosecutor Randall Eliason You could have a conspiracy to defraud the US by interfering with our electionMueller must also separate efforts that might seem seedy from those that are illegalAn opposition_research firm funded by Clintons campaign and the DNC tapped a former_British spy to dig into Trumps personal and business_dealings and the former spy purportedly solicited information from Russian_government officials That work might similarly be viewed as an unsavory effort to engage with foreign interests to win an election but it would not necessarily be illegal if there was no conspiracy to defraud anyone legal_analysts saidThere could be something out there that stinks to high

Opposition research is nothing new in political races or the corporate world but it is not a common practice for a news website to hire out such work which is often expensive Firms like Fusion_GPS can

Mostly cloudy showers Highs 57-61A very variable pattern prevails over this forecast period with just a little_bit of everything in store If you like sunny classic autumn weather today is your day as tomorrow shifts back to cooler cloudier conditions with showers We warm more strongly by Thursday and Friday (70s) but clouds and then rain risks increase especially by this weekend with another cool wedge situation A few morning clouds possible but otherwise mostly sunny skies offer a fairly decent day as temperatures move up toward seasonal high temperature levels in the upper 50s to low 60s Light breezes blow from the west HighBundle the kids up appropriately before they head out to trick-or-treat The night becomes partly cloudyand cooler with lows ranging from the middle-upper 30s in the outer suburbs to the middle 40s in the city Light winds mainly from the north HighA cold morning commute Mostly cloudy with a chance of afternoon showers or light rain (especially north and west) as high temperatures only manage to make the cool 50s to around 60 Light winds mainly come from the easterly direction to reinforce a cool wedging pattern Rainfall totals should be really light from just 001 inches to maybe a tenth of an inch Medium-high Some evening showers or light rain but otherwise mostly cloudy with lows ranging through the 40s to around 50 in the city Winds light to calm Medium trends warmer with partly cloudy skies and highs in the upper 60s t0 low 70s runs partly cloudy with lows in the warmer 50s Medium should be our warmest day of the week with lower to middle 70s for highs with partly sunny skies A stray shower chance is possible late in the day is cloudier with scattered showers or light rain as lows dip only into the 50s MediumThe first of November isnt offering up much in the way of nice weather A big high pressure area stalls out over New England and a cool wedge along a stalled front gets established The result is mostly cloudy skies through the weekend with periods of showers light rain and drizzle/mist mess Timing out the periods of precipitation remain more difficult but right_now it seems like may be the window for the most precipitation risks all of it mainly light Highs both days should be in the 50s to around 60 with lows in the 50s too Low-mediumClouds and showers with the cool wedge could linger into as well but we may manage to break back into the warmer 70s by either or if not then afternoon next week as our variable seasonal transition soldiers onwardDanish inventor Peter Madsenadmitted to dismembering the body of freelance journalist Kim Wall Danish police said Monday marking the latest shift in Madsens explanation for how Walls severed body sank tothe sea floor off the coast of CopenhagenMadsen still maintains he did_not kill Wall according to a police now claiming Wall died of carbon monoxide poisoning inside his submarine while he was on deckAccording to her family Wall 30 was writing a piece about Madsen 46 an amateur rocket builder known in Denmark for using crowdfunding to build submarines and rockets Wall a freelance journalist who hadSri Lanka the Marshall Islands and North_Korea boarded the submarine on Aug 10 and was reported missingon Aug 11 That day Madsen was pulled from Koge Bay after police say he deliberately sank his submarineMadsen was taken into custody on Aug 12and his trial is expected to begin in MarchSince August Madsens retelling of what led to Walls death has changed repeatedly He is being held in Vestre Prison in Copenhagen and has been charged with manslaughter Madsen told a Danish court that he was showing Wall around his boat when he lost his grip on a 150-pound hatch which then collided with Walls skull He said he panicked and gave Wall what prosecutors called a burial at seaIn the shock I was in it was the right thing to do Madsen according to Agence France-PresseReuters that Madsen said there was a pool of blood where she had landed before he panicked and tossed her lifeless body overboardYet when divers discovered Walls in early October the gruesome details of that burial began to cast doubt on Madsens testimony The Associated Press reported that Walls severed legs were found in plastic bags weighted with metal while her recovered head showed no signs of fracture like it would have if struck by a hatchAnother bag contained a knife along with Walls clothing A naked torso had been found in the same waters weeks earlier and had been stabbed 15 times according to the APBut even Madsens claim that he gave Wall at burial at sea contradicted what he told police immediately after her disappearance Madsen initially claimed he dropped Wall off on shore in Copenhagen before his submarine a 60-foot UC3 Nautilus sankBut once police pulled the boat up from the sea floor they discovered blood inside Madsen was arrested on a manslaughter charge and accused of scuttling his own ship Authorities matched blood found inside the submarine with DNA from the torso and from Walls toothbrush and hairbrush police said in a news conferenceWhen the torso washed up on shore several days after the submarine was recovered Madsen conceded that Wall had died on board But he claimed it was an accident caused by the falling hatch The charges_against Madsen were then upgraded to murderTwo people are on a boat Her legs and head and arms were cut_off and we can prove that Jakob Buch-Jepsen special prosecutor with the Copenhagen police told The Washington_Post Madsen has told prosecutors that he was interested in sadomasochism and had had sex onboard the Nautilus beforeIn September aSwedish newspaper quoted Madsens defense lawyer as saying Madsen was not quite like other people in his sexual preferences despite his being harmless Madsen still denies having sex with Wall according to Mondays news releaseYet prosecutors said they had discovered videos on Madsens computer of women being tortured and decapitated Buch-Jepsen said he and his colleagues presumed the images to be realMadsen said duringthe pretrial session that the computer hard drive which was found in a laboratory run by Madsen didnt belong to him but instead were part of tools used by everyone in the laboratoryMondays news release said that over the past two weeks several dives had been carried_out to find Walls arms and cellphone The dives have so_far been unsuccessfulUnlike garden variety yeast infections this one causes serious bloodstream infections spreads easily from person to person in health-care settings and survives for months on skin and for weeks on bed rails chairs and other hospital equipmentSome strains are resistant to all three major classes of antifungal drugs Based on information from a limited number of patients up to 60 percent of people with these infection have died Many of them also had other serious underlying illnessesThose at greatest risk are individuals who have been in intensive care for a long time or who are onventilators or have central line catheters inserted into a large veinIn the United_States the largest number of infections has been reported in New_York with at_least 28 cases according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Infections have also been reported in Illinois Maryland Massachusetts and New_Jersey Last June the CDC sent an urgent alert to clinicians to start looking for the infections which are difficult to identify with standard laboratory methodsAs soon as we put out that alert we started to get information about cases and now we know more about how it spreads and how its acting Tom Chiller the CDCs top fungal expert said in an interview Thursday The CDC now tracks the updating the case count every few weeksIn addition to the 35 infected patients an additional 18 were carrying the organism but werent sickened by itThe microbe is among a group of newly emerging drug-resistant threats health officials saidThese pathogens are increasing theyre new theyre scary and theyre very difficult to combat said Anne Schuchat CDCs acting director during a briefing in Washington this week about the growing danger fromOf the first seven cases that were last fall four patients had bloodstream infections and died during the weeks to months after the pathogen was identified Officials said they couldnt be sure whether the deaths were caused by the infection because all the individuals had other serious medical conditions Five patients had the fungus initially isolated from blood one from urine and one from the earThe infection is still relatively rare Its really hitting the sickest of the sick Chiller saidSo far the fungus doesnt seem to be evolving into new strains within the United_States Because the country doesnt yet have any homegrown strains of the deadly fungus it gives us a better opportunity to contain it and stop it from spreading Chiller saidIn other countries infections have been resistant to all three major types of antifungal drugs but so_far the US cases have been treatable with existing drugsBecause invasive bloodstream infections with are common in hospitalized patients in the United_States health officials are concerned that this deadly strain could get into that mix Chiller saidUnlike infections in the mouth throat or vagina (which are typically called yeast infections) invasive yeast infections can affect the blood heart brain eyes bones and other parts of the body and are more dangerousAmong infectious disease clinicians and laboratory personnel infections involving fungi dont typically ring the same kind of alarm bells as until nowThis is a paradigm shift because is not generally thought of as highly resistant or passed person to person Chiller saidSince the CDC issued its alert in June the agency has provided funds and additional expertise to help regional laboratories and hospitals identify the organismKim Jong_Un stood on the stage in front of stylized portraits of his father and grandfather men he wasnt supposed to be strong enough or cunning enoughto succeed lauding the thrilling explosion of the most recent nuclear_test and the leap forward in all sectors of the national economyHis Western-style suit his haircut his glasses even his gravelly voice were all reminiscent of his grandfather Kim_Il Sung the founder and eternal president of North_Korea who to this day is associated with strength and prosperityIn front of him in the huge hall were 3467 delegates called in May to the before Kim_Jong Un was even born Among them were hard-nosed party stalwarts the sort who had been expected by some analysts to turn against the inexperienced upstart when he first rose to the top But there they were men in military uniforms covered to the waist in medals cheering party officials scientists the editor of the party newspaper anti-Japanese revolutionary war veterans field laborersIt was Kims moment It was his way of saying Im in charge here And these were the people who were keeping him in power the North_Korean loyalists who like Kim have a vested interest in keeping the worlds most repressive regime intactTheir supportenabled Kim to celebrate his fifth anniversary as the leader of North_Korea on Saturday propelling the communist monarchy into its 71st yearThe Kim family has ruled the country through fear and favors since the end of World_War II when Kim_Il Sung was chosen by Joseph Stalin to run it as a Soviet client state His son Kim_Jong Il continued the family rule for 17 years until his five_years ago Saturdayat age 69The founders grandson Kim_Jong Un was then anointed as the Great Successor in a country where the Kim family is deified and its supporters live large while the remaining 20-odd million North_Koreans struggle to feed their families and heat their shabby homesDuring the transition plenty of people who make a living studying North_Korea from abroad predicted the systems demise doubtful that a Swiss-educated Chicago Bulls fan with no military background and none of the revolutionary myth of his forebears could retain control of a country run by hard-line octogenariansBut he hasFive years on the Kim regime has not just held together it is relatively strong The economy has been growing if not booming The country has functioning nuclear_weapons and is toward being able to deliver them to the continental United StatesKim has given his closest ally Chinese President_Xi Jinping the cold shoulder and suffered little for it He has threatened to attack the United_States and has actually attacked South_Korea but the sanctions_imposed as punishment have fallen well short of fatalHe has been a good dictator in the sense that he has behaved in accordance with the rules said Bruce Bueno de Mesquita a political scientist at New_York University who describes how authoritarian leaders around the world retain power in his book Why Bad Behavior Is Almost Always Good PoliticsHe has governed through corruption and rent-seeking and keeping the population miserableAnd theres no reason to expect Kim to be going anywhere soon Bueno de Mesquita said If they survive the first two years most dictators die in their sleepKen Gause a North_Korea leadership expert_at CNA a research company in Arlington Va agreed that Kim seems firmly in control at_least for nowYou have a leader who is becoming more comfortable in his own skin and is able to delegate and manipulate the levers of power in a much more sophisticated way Gause said I would say he is still working on building and solidifying his power But for all intents and purposes he is the leader in every sense of the wordFor kleptocratic dictators the world over the key to staying in power is keeping the elite happy and rivals scaredNowhere is this the case more_than in North KoreaKim has retained power by relying on a relatively small group perhaps a couple of hundred military officials Politburo members and money-makers who also have an interest in keeping him at the helm When he convened the congress in May he put more of his core supporters into positions of power Regimes like this stay intact by spending money on the military and the apparatchiks instead of on the massesHes paying the people who keep him in office enough so they wont defect to anyone else Bueno de Mesquita said He needs to keep the loyalists loyalAnd for the loyalists of Pyongyang life is the best it has been in decadesThere are new high-rise apartment buildings popping up everywhere although the lower floors are most desired since there isnt enough electricity to power the elevators Theres a pizza restaurant in the city and a German beer hall amusement parks and swimming pools Supermarkets stock Japanese mayonnaise and French wine Taxis are everywhere With money anything is possibleAnd increasingly people have money Once reliant entirely on the state North_Koreans have been increasingly allowed to Factory managers and co-operative farmers have more freedom to innovate as long as they meet their state quotas and private trade in products from television sets to chewing gum is now tolerated A recent study from Seouls Korea Institute for National Unification that the North_Korean government collects between $13million and $17million each day in fees from market tradersA new class of donju or masters of money has emerged in this space between state and private activity using their positions in the regime many travel to the outside_world where they can trade to enrich their leader and themselvesBut while tinkering at the margins Kim has operated very much according to the playbook written by his grandfather He has elevated the standing of the Workers_Party and emphasized economic_development both of which under his father were subordinated to the military and nuclear weaponsThere is no doubt that the economy is a shadow of what it could be State factories remain stuck in the Soviet era if they are operating at all Tough multilateral and direct sanctions_imposed after nuclear and missile_tests are bitingThose sanctions threaten the foreign-currency earnings that Kim needs to continue underwriting the lifestyles of the North_Korean upper crust and keeping them happyBut the country is still in its best economic shape in decades with growth of about 2 or 3percent according to private-sector analysts much better than in the years of contraction under his fatherIf Kim who turns 33 on Jan 8 maintains the support of North_Koreas top tier he could remain in power for decades to come said Sue Mi Terry a former North_Korea analyst at the CIAThe junior Kim has already ruled for five_years and could conceivably rule for another 50 years she said if he maintains the support of North_Koreas elites the shareholders in his regime But there will be challengesWhile the elites as a group by and large still support him there are signs of growing discord among the ruling class as it struggles for power and influence Terry said noting that there have been several high-profile defections from the regime this yearBut Kim doesnt just use money to curry favor he uses to instill fear Since he took power at_least 100 top-level officials have been purged or executedMost notably he had his own uncle Jang Song Thaek hauled out of a meeting at the end of 2013 broadcast on television and denounced as a traitor for all ages thenThe elites know that if Kim can turn on his uncle and other high-ranking officers like he did any of them could be next in his gun sights Terry saidCheong Seong Chang a leadership expert_at the Sejong Institute outside Seoul said the purges are a sign of Kims strengthIf Kim_Jong Uns power base was weak it would have been risky to execute these high-ranking officials he said noting that the younger Kim executed many fewer people than his father did about 2000 during his own transition period These executions show that he has absolute powerFor one of the worlds most threatening figures very little is known about Kim as a personIntelligence from inside the isolated state is notoriously thin and only a handful of outsiders have met him The only Americans to have spent any time with him are Dennis Rodman the former Chicago Bulls basketball player who visited the country three times and his entourageJoe Terwilliger a New_York geneticist who accompanied Rodman on two of his trips said Kim is very different in person from the outside worlds caricature of himHes charming and gregarious and very friendly He told a lot of jokes and we had open conversations about every imaginable topic like hanging out with old friends said Terwilliger who went jet-skiing with Kim at his summer house and sang karaoke in front of him He especially likes sports music and movies and even asked about Sylvester StalloneSince taking over Kim has cultivated an image as a man of the people Hes gone on rides at one of Pyongyangs new amusement parks Unlike his father who never appeared in public with any of his wives Kim is often accompanied by his fashionable spouseKim and Ri who are believed to have two or three young children have visited Pyongyang residents in their apartments sitting on the floor with them Kim has even poured drinks for his hosts a humble gesture in a culture that prizes seniority and protocolState media shows Kim with a much smaller retinue than his father had and he is tactile often slapping backs and clasping hands a huge smile on his faceExperts have been trying to psychoanalyze North_Koreas leaders for decades but its hard given how few clues there are The popular view is of a nuclear-armed madman but such mockery risks underestimating KimPeople like him are not crazy and they are not erratic said Bueno de Mesquita the NYU political scientist They are carefully calculatingBut given Kims capacity for brutality his and his apparently impulsive tendencies there is reason to be concerned about his hot-headedness said Jerrold Post a psychiatrist who founded the CIAs personality analysis centerThis is all about big boys and their big toys Post said I must say Im concerned about words leading to actions between him andIndeed Kim has proved quick to escalate tensions as in the summer of 2015 when a confrontation with South_Korea over a land-mine attack brought the two_countries to the brink of warThe next two or three years will be critical for Kim analysts say as he solidifies his control and confronts the unconventional Donald Trump administration But if the past is any guide it would be prudent to avoid making predictions about the North_Korean regimes imminent demiseThere has been a lot of wishful thinking going on since the 1990s said Gause of CNA Im not saying that their days are not numbered but North_Korea is a very resilient country You cant go on expecting the Kim family to crumble Yoonjung_Seo contributed to this reportNorth Korea has made no secret of its goal to produce an_intercontinental ballistic_missile capable of hitting the United_States mainland giving it the means to send a nuclear_warhead to its archenemy Kim_Jong Uns rocket scientists are thought to be several years from being able to do this instead concentrating on intermediate-range missiles that can reach only as far as GuamBut now some analysts are asking Did North_Korea just try to launch two long-range missilesWe think it is important that people consider the possibility that this was a KN-08 test said Jeffrey_Lewis director of the East_Asia nonproliferation program at the Middlebury_Institute of International_Studies at Monterey in California referring to the intercontinental_ballistic missile or ICBM by its technical nameNorth Korea conducted two missile_tests earlier_this month on Oct 9 and 19 Both took_place at an air base in Kusong on North_Koreas west coast on the other side of the country from the usual Musudan test_site near Wonsan on the east coastThe United_States Strategic Command said Wednesday that both tests are presumed to be of Musudan missiles and South_Korean military officials have said the same The Musudan is technically capable of flying as far as 2400 miles putting Guam within range and almost reaching AlaskaThese would mark the seventh and eighth Musudan tests this year Only one in June was a success flying about 250miles and reaching a surprisingly high altitude But after poring over satellite photos enhanced with a near infrared band of light Lewis and his fellow experts at MIIS think theres an even chance that the launches were of ICBMsWere not fully persuaded that it was a Musudan Lewis said noting that Strategic Command known as StratCom twice misidentified three missiles that North_Korea launched in SeptemberWe still think people are being too quick to jump to the conclusion that this was a Musudan Even if its only 50/50 being shocked half of the time is still bad he saidLooking at before-and-after satellite imagery from Planet Labs a San Francisco-based imaging company Lewis and his colleagues found burn scars after each missile firing showing where the hot exhaust scorched the pavement and grass Near infrared light can discriminate between burned and untouched parts of vegetationNon-proliferation analysts say that the burn scars suggest a huge explosion(Planet Labs)The first scar is really big That is consistent with a catastrophic failure he said noting that it was possible that the explosion damaged the launch vehicle on which it was mounted The second burn scar is small like the missile flew some distance before whatever went wrongThese big burn scars are much bigger than what had been seen after Musudan tests and the fact that they happened on the other side of the country added to suspicions about the kind of missile being testedOther analysts said it is possible if not probable that the tests were of ICBMsWhile this was most likely a Musudan test the possibility of a KN-08 cannot be ruled out said John Schilling an aerospace engineer who frequently writes about the Norths missiles Schilling expects North_Koreas road-mobile ICBMs to reach operational status early in the next decade perhaps within five yearsIt seems most likely that the latest test was an attempt to test the Musudan from an operational launch facility rather_than a test facility he said explaining the difference in test locationAlthough noting that StratCom should be able to distinguish between a Musudan and a much larger ICBM he also pointed out that the US agency had misidentified the three missiles launched last_month StratCom first called them short-range Rodongs then medium-range Musudans They turned out to be extended-range Scud missilesI do not place high confidence in their ability to distinguish a KN-08 from a Musudan Schilling said And I do not think anyone should have high confidence in their ability to predict North_Korean behavior regarding missile testing Joseph S Bermudez Jr chief analytics officer at AllSource Analysis a Denver-based consultancy also said the likelihood was that the missiles were medium-range MusudansGiven their concentration on perfecting the Musudan I would think they were testing a Musudan he said saying that the test_site could have been moved simply to make it harder for intelligence_agencies to monitor the activityAlthough all but one Musudan test has failed North_Korea has shown rapid advances with its missile program this year It successfully launched a ballistic_missile from a submarine in August and launched what it said was a satellite in February That launch was widely considered a cover for an ICBM testJapans Asahi television network citing an unnamed North_Korean military source reported earlier_this month that Kim had ordered ICBM development to be finished by the end of this year A spokesman for North_Koreas space agency last_week pledged that the state would continue working on its peaceful satellite programRegardless of whether this latest test was of medium- or long-range missiles analysts agree that they are cause for concernWhats more concerning is not an individual test or two individual tests its that theyre approaching their missile development in a very pragmatic way Bermudez saidWhat theyre doing is exactly right They are testing and they are testing often he said This is the way you really learn how to develop a ballistic_missile and thats what worries me In the United_States there is growing recognition of the increased threat posed by North KoreaJames R Clapper Jr the director of national intelligence said Tuesday that the United_States had to assume that North_Korea would be able to mount a nuclear_warhead on a missile_capable of reaching the West Coast of the United StatesWe ascribe to them the capability to launch a missile that would have a weapon on it to reach parts of the United_States certainly including Alaska and Hawaii he said in a discussion at the Council on Foreign RelationsThey could do it We have to make the worst-case assumption here he saidClapper also said that trying to persuade North_Korea to give up its weapons was now probably a lost cause given that the program was its ticket to survivalEarlier this month Jami Miscik previously a top analyst at the CIA warned against underestimating North_Koreas capabilitiesThe fact these rocket launches are failing shouldnt give anyone comfort she said at Fortunes Most Powerful Women summit according to the magazine They fail and they fix that thing and it might fail for another reason but theyre advancing in terms of their capabilityTOKYO How do you solve a problem like North_Korea Its a problem that has befuddled American presidents for decadesWell Donald Trump has a new idea In the first debate Monday_night the Republican candidate appeared to suggest that China should invade North KoreaYou look at North_Korea were doing nothing there Trump said when asked about his policy on nuclear_weapons during the debate China should solve that problem for us China should go into North_Korea China is totally powerful as it relates to North_Korea China responded within hours toTrumps suggestion by saying it has been making unremitting efforts with all sides concerned to resolve the nuclear issue according to Foreign_Ministry spokesman_Geng Shuang on TuesdayThe idea that China once North_Koreas patron now the closest thing it has to a friend (and its not that close) has leverage over North_Korea is not newPyongyangs nuclear_tests are routinely met with condemnation then sanctions through the United_Nations that are aimed_at cutting off the regimes ability to get parts for its weapons_program or earn the money needed to finance it After this months nuclear_test there were many calls for China to get serious about imposing international sanctions on the North The sanctions are not effective unless Beijing fully implements them cracking down on the Chinese intermediaries that do business with North KoreaBeijing has become increasingly angry during the reign of North_Korean leader Kim_Jong Un and has supported increasingly stringent sanctions but analysts say its ultimate consideration has not changed It does_not want the regime to collapse sending millions of hungry North_Koreans into China and potentially the 28000 American troops stationed in South_Korea right up to its borderBut Trumps suggestion that China go into North_Korea took the exhortations for Beijing to act to a whole new level and is a bit of contrast to his own suggestions over the summerRemember that back in June Trump suggested he would deal with North_Korea by to Washington but not for a state dinner just for hamburgers around a conference tableOn Twitter there was widespread disbelief at the idea that a military invasion was the answerDonald Trump just encouraged China to invade North_Korea Terry Canales (@TerryCanales40) Indeed analysts poured cold water on the very idea that leaning on China was a new strategyHas the Bush administration not tried to use Chinese leverage to control Pyongyang Has not the Obama_administration Eom Sang-yoon a research fellow at the Sejong Institute What Trump is saying is very basic so_far he has not provided any details on how his policy will be different from that of Obama Sang-yoon saidBut the Republican candidate did_not just stop at China He criticized the Obama administrations nuclear agreement with Iran as the worst deal I_think Ive ever seen negotiatedCracking down on North_Korea should have been made part of that deal Trump saidIran is one of their biggest trading partners Iran has power over North_Korea Trump said When they made that horrible deal with Iran they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North KoreaThat claim had Iran experts scratching their headsTrump has power over North KoreaKhamenei will wake up finding himself ruling half the world Ariane M Tabatabai (@ArianeTabatabai) Trump also took the opportunity to again insist that Japan and South_Korea both American allies should be paying more for their defenseJust to go down the list we defend Japan we defend Germany we defend South_Korea we defend Saudi Arabia we defend countries They do not pay us he saidBut they should be paying us because we are providing tremendous service and were losing a fortune saying that we are losing billions and billions of dollars This isnt 40 years_ago where we could do what were doing We cant defend Japan a behemoth selling us cars by the million he saidIn fact these countries do pay for their own defense Japan pays almost $2 billion a year to host American troops on its soil while South_Korea pays about $850 million annually We wrote about the costs and benefits of the two alliances earlier_this year This is how one former Republican spokesman on the Hill respondedKorea actually pays hundreds of millions of dollars a year for our military Trump knows that Still lied Brian Walsh (@brianjameswalsh) In Seoul the government broke with normal diplomatic protocol to rebut Trumps remarksOur government normally considers it inappropriate to comment on remarks by a particular [American] presidential_candidate Cho June-hyuck spokesman at the Foreign_Ministry said at a press briefingNevertheless I can say that our government has contributed to and played a role in maintaining and strengthening the combined defense capability of South_Korea and the US as well as stably stationing US Forces Korea here the spokesman said according to a report from the Yonhap_News AgencyMondaymorning Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) a liberal government watchdog organization joined with several prominent law professors to against President Trump alleging that he is in violation of the emoluments_clause (aka the foreign emoluments clause) of the Constitution The suit filed in the Southern_District of New_York seeks a declaratory judgmenton the meaning and application of the clause a ruling that Trump has violated the clause and an injunction prohibiting further violations Those joining CREW in the suit include Harvards Laurence Tribe UC Irvines Erwin Chemerinsky and Fordham Universitys Zephyr Teachout The complaint is One problem for the litigants is that there is virtually no precedent on the and scholars disagree on and even Historical practice provides some guide but its not dispositive There have been a from the Office of Legal Counsel over the years but they are not entirely consistent with one another While we can of the clause suggested by some commentators real questions remain about which of the presidents extensive business relationships and interests could give rise to emolument clause violations and under what circumstances (And even if the president is not violating the emoluments_clause there are still plenty of reasons to be concerned that his investments create other conflicts of interest and that he should do more to extricate himself from such conflicts but thats a subject for another time This post is focusing on the legal issues)CREW faces a bigger problem than trying to convince a federal court that Trump is violating the Constitution It will first have convince the court that it is entitled to litigate this question at all In order to maintain a suit in federal court a plaintiff must show that the requirements of Article III standing are satisfied In this case CREWs arguments for standing are a stretch In short CREW will have a hard time showing that it has suffered a cognizable injury from Trumps alleged violation of the emoluments_clause an injury that is both actual or imminent as well as concrete and particularized to CREW let alone that such injury was caused by Trumps conduct and that it is redressable by a favorable court judgmentThe core of CREWs argument for standing is that Trumps violations of the emoluments_clause have injured CREW because as an organization dedicated to policing government ethics and misconductthese violations give it more work to do and divert resources from other issuesFrom the complaintCREW brings this action to stop and prevent the violations of the Foreign Emoluments Clause that Defendant Donald_J Trump has committed and will commit which have already injuredand without a remediable order from this Court will_continue to injureCREW in the form of a significant diversion and depletion of its time resources and efforts CREW has standing under 455 US 363 379 (1982) because there has been a concrete and demonstrable injury to the organizations activities[] with the consequent drain on the organizations resources 6 F3d 898 904-05 (2d Cir 1993)For those familiar with standing law this may seem like an odd argument because if it were accepted in such broad terms it would make standing a non-issue for advocacy organizations of all stripes Environmental organizations for example would be able to assert standing for any and all alleged violations of federal environmental laws on the grounds that such violations injure those groups by forcing them to divert resources to police those violations Instead as anyone remotely familiar with recent standing jurisprudence knows environmental groups often have to go to significant lengths to demonstrate standing lest they be thrown out of court as has happened in cases such asandSimilarly if standing were as easy to establish as CREW suggests we would have expected a different outcome in other cases such as as wellCREWs standing claim is based upon thecase cited above In that case the Supreme_Court heldthat a local non-profit Housing Opportunities Made Equal (HOME) had standing to challenge violations of the Fair Housing Act because such violations frustrated HOMEs purpose Specifically HOME operated counseling and referral services to help individuals find homes and advance the cause of increasing housing opportunity and argued that unlawful housing discrimination made it more difficult and costly to perform those functions CREW on the other hand alleges something quite different Whereas HOME had to spend more resources because unlawful discrimination made it more difficult to find homes for those it served CREW claims it has to spend more resources answering press inquiries explaining the emoluments_clause to policymakers and the public and hiring an additional attorney so CREW may more effectively counteract Trumps ethical and legal violations In other words CREWs argument is that its injury is having to spend money to file this lawsuit and raise awareness about the issues it presents HOME in the courts words could allege injuries that were far more_than simply a setback to the organizations abstract social interests CREW Not so muchAnother important distinction betweenand is that the latter concerneda statute with provisions expressly authorizing private suits to enforce its requirements With this provision Congress made clear it wanted to do as much as possible to facilitate more stringent enforcement of the FHAs terms through private litigation a point Justice Brennan stressed in his opinion for the court Yet there is nothing in the emoluments clausenor in any federal legislation creating a cause of action to enforce the provisions terms let alone the sort of explicit cause of action contained in the FHA This matters because as the court has stressed time and again Congress may create procedural rights that ease the standing burden Without such a statutorily created right however CREWs burden becomes that much greaterThere are other differences between and Josh Blackman identifies some such as the fact that HOME sought money damages a form of relief that would clearly redress their alleged injury whereas CREW does_not He also notes that Justice Ginsburg cited toquite a bit in but that Ginsburg was also writing in dissentPerhaps aware of the standing problem facing this suit CREW decided to file its action in New_York within the jurisdiction of the US Court of Appeals for the 2ndCircuit rather_than in DC This is likely because in the 2nd Circuit adopted a somewhat more expansive interpretation ofthan have other circuits including the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Yet evendoes not go as far as CREW needs to sustain this suit as the plaintiff organization there raised claims much closer to those of HOME in than CREW does hereStanding is not the only jurisdictional obstacle to CREWs suit even if it is the most substantial Another potential barrier is the Political Question doctrine which further limits the power of the federal courts I will address this doctrine and explain how it might apply to in a follow-up postTRUMP So its been 235 days since crooked Hillary_Clinton has had a press conference And you as reporters who give her all of these glowing reports should ask yourselves why And Ill tell_you why Because despite the nice platitudes shes been a messYou look at whats happened with ISIS which isnt even mentioned You look at whats_happening with law and order they dont even mention our police They mention everybody but our police They dont have an American flag on the dais until we started complaining and then they ran up with two very small little flags one that we sawSo you know I put myself through your news conferences often not that its fun 235 days no news_conference for Hillary_Clinton You oughta check it out because theres a lot going onHer great disloyalty to the person that rigged the system for her Debbie Wasserman Schultz she totally rigged it Bernie_Sanders never had a chanceAnd total disloyalty its like youre fired get out fast The e-mail situation I call it the double e-mail situation both very serious What was said in the last ones to the DNC was horrible absolutely horribleIf I wouldve used language like they used about religion about race about everything else that they discuss in those e-mails I wouldve had to run and hide and probably drop out of the raceWith her everythings just fine So just ask yourself why she doesnt have news conferences And honestly the reason is because theres no way she can answer_questions because the job she has done is so badWhen they talk about change I noticed they have change Shes been there for 30_years Thirty years Theres no change Its going to be the same its going to be an extension of Obama In my opinion worse She lied about TPP She was for TPP she saw me on television knocking the hell out of it because its a horror show its going to kill all our jobs its going to be almost as bad as NAFTA maybe worse which her_husband signed by the way which destroyed this country destroyed manufacturing in the United StatesAnd Ill do something about it thatll be so renegotiated And by the way yesterday for the first time she said she wants to renegotiate trade agreements First time yesterday Well because of meShe also saw me talking_about TPP and currency manipulation and currency devaluation And she heard it and she said wow she cant win that subject in a debateSo all of a sudden she goes and she goes against TPP her vice_president is one of the biggest proponents of TPP and now hes going against it And Bernie_Sanders was right he was against itThey will go for TPP and vote it in very shortly_after the election if she wins which for the sake of our country we all hope and I hope that she doesnt They will vote it in -- just mark my words hopefully we dont have to worry about it -- but she will voteShell change a comma shell change a paragraph of the 6000 page document that nobodys even read on our side Just so you understand the other countries know every word every paragraph every sentence every single comma and periodWe dont even read it our country Because were led by stupid people so she saw me talking_about TPP she realized that she couldnt defend it her special interests are pushing her hard because shes bought and sold by the special interestsTheyre pushing her very hard and so she said shes against it The day she gets in -- which hopefully will never happen -- she will approve or shortly thereafter TPP And that will be another disaster for job in our country OKSo why dont we start off any questions Yes sirQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Its just a total deflection this whole thing with Russia In fact I saw her campaign_manager I dont_know his title Mook I saw him on television and they asked him about Russia and the hackingBy the way they hacked -- they probably have her 33000 e-mails I hope they do They probably have her 33000 e-mails that she lost and deleted because youd see some beauties there So lets seeBut I watched this guy Mook and he talked about we think it was Russia that hacked Now first of all was what was said on those thats so bad but he said I watched it I_think he was live But he said we think it was Russia that hackedAnd then he said -- and this is in person sitting and watching television as Ive been doing -- and then he said could be Trump yeah yeah Trump Trump oh yeah Trump He reminded me of John Lovitz for Saturday Night Live in the liar (ph) where hed go yes yes I went to Harvard Harvard yes yes This is the guy you have to see it Yes it could be Trump yes yes So it is so farfetched Its so ridiculous Honestly I wish I had that power Id love to have that power but Russia has no respect for our countryAnd thats why -- if it is Russia nobody even knows this its probably China or it could be somebody sitting in his bed But it shows how weak we are it shows how disrespected we are Total -- assuming its Russia or China or one of the major countries and competitors its a total sign of disrespect for our country Putin and the leaders throughout the world have no respect for our country anymore and they certainly have no respect for our leader So I know nothing about it Its one of the most farfetched Ive ever heard Yes Jon (ph)QUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I never met Putin I dont_know who Putin is He said one nice thing about me He said Im a genius I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it I never met PutinQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I would treat Vladimir_Putin firmly but theres nothing that I can think of that Id rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right_now so that we can go and knock out ISIS together with other people and with other countries Wouldnt it be nice if we actually got along with people wouldnt it be nice if we actually got along as an example with Russia Im all for it and lets go get ISIS because we have to get ISIS and we have to get them fastYou saw what_happened with the priest its only going to get worse And Hillary_Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more people from that region into our country and we have no idea who they are where they come from where their documentation is its only going to get worse and its going to start getting bad in our country Were letting people come in by the tens of thousands You see what_happened to the French priest A friend of mine he said he was going to France like three four months_ago I saw him yesterday I said howd you like France He said I wouldnt go to France I wouldnt go to France Because France is no_longer France France is no_longer France They wont like me for saying that but you see what_happened in Nice you see what_happened yesterday with the priest who was supposed to be a spectacular man France is no_longer France and this world better be very careful and they better get very tough and very smart and theyll never do it with Hillary ClintonAnd by the way in terms of change shes been there for 30_years Shes been doing this for 30_years What shes going to go all of sudden things are going to change Shes bought and sold 100 percent by special interests and lobbyists Yes Tom (ph)QUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP None noneQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Because its under order And Ill release them when the audits completed Nobody would release when its under -- Ive had audits for 15 or 16 years Every year I have a routine audit Im under audit when the audits complete Ill release them But zero I_mean I will tell_you right_now zero I have nothing to do with Russia yesQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I dont_know I dont_know It depends on the audit It depends on the audit not a big deal By the way just so you understand Ive released my papers 104 pages of documents I built an unbelievable company tremendous cash tremendous company with some of the great assets of the world Youve seen it You were all very disappointed when you saw it actually but thats OK Far far great than anybody ever thought I have a great company I built an unbelievable company but if you look there youll see theres nothing in RussiaAnd as far as the tax_returns as soon as the audits complete like any lawyer would tell_you Greta Van Susteren she was going over it a while ago shes a lawyer She said well no lawyer would let somebody release a tax return when theyre under audit Its a routine audit Ive gone through audits which I_think is very unfair for 15 years I have friends that are very rich and never get audited Im audited every year Maybe thats because of politics who knowsQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Im not going to tell Putin what to do Why should I tell Putin what to do He already did something today where he said dont blame them essentially for your incompetence Let_me tell_you its not even about Russia or China or whoever it is thats doing the hacking It was about the things that were said in those e-mails They were terrible things talking_about Jewish talking_about race talking_about atheist trying to pin labels on people -- what was said was a disgrace and it was Debbie Wasserman Schultz and believe me as sure as youre sitting there Hillary_Clinton knew about it She knew everything Debbie Wasserman Schultz could not breathe without speaking and getting approval from Hillary_Clinton Couldnt breathe And you saw that It also showed that it was a fixed race but Ive been saying that long before I saw the e-mails It was a rigged race It was totally rigged And Debbie Wasserman Schultz rigged it for Hillary_Clinton and the sad part is Bernie_Sanders has to use an old word that I use on occasion hes lost his energy He wants to go home and go to sleep But hes got a lot of people that walked out last night Now hundreds of people walked out of the Democrat Convention last night I didnt even hear about it Nobody showed it I didnt see it on television You people dont talk about itThe Republican Convention was incredible I hear I had one of the biggest bounces in decades Like some people are saying nine points In fact a poll just came out ten minutes ago Los Angeles Times Trump 47 Clinton 40 And the reason is that people are sick and tired of Hillary ClintonQUESTION (inaudible) Putin (ph) say stay out Why not say thatTRUMP Why do I have to (ph) get involved with Putin I have nothing to do with Putin Ive never spoken to him I dont_know anything about him other than he will respect me He doesnt respect our president And if it is Russia -- which its probably not nobody knows who it is -- but if it is Russia its really bad for a different reason because it shows how little respect they have for our country when they would hack into a major party and get everything But it would be interesting to see -- I will tell_you this -- Russia if youre listening I hope youre able to find the 30000 e-mails that are missing I_think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press Lets see if that happens Thatll be next Yes sirQUESTION (inaudible) this audience and make (ph) your campaign -- what exactly do you believe should happen to minimum_wage in this country (inaudible)OK Sure Two big questions The minimum_wage has to go up People are -- at_least $10 but it has to go up But I_think that states -- federal -- I_think that states should really call the shot As an example I live in New_York Its very expensive in New_York You cant buy a hot dog for the money youre talking_about You go to other states and its not expensive at all Now what it does is puts New_York at a disadvantage if the minimum_wage is up companies move out and things bad things happen At the same_time people have to be taken care of But what Im really going to do on the minimum_wage -- but it has to go upNow Bernie_Sanders lied Bernie_Sanders said in his speech the other day that Donald Trump wants the minimum_wage to go below $7 I said where did he come up with that one That one is just like Joe Biden lied today He said that Donald Trump wants to carpet_bomb -- he was on television -- he said Donald Trump wants to carpet_bomb the enemy in the Middle_East Now that was Ted_Cruz that said that That was not Donald Trump I_mean hes not a very bright guy but that was Ted_Cruz that said it And he said it with such surety -- Donald Trump wants to carpet_bomb -- I never said I wanted to carpet_bomb That was Ted_Cruz You remember Ted_Cruz said it You will confirm that I_think Go aheadSo I would like to raise it to at_least $10 and what Im_going to do is Im_going to bring jobs back to this country so that people can start working again so that the $10 and the $15 and the numbers youre talking_about are going to -- literally theyre going to be peanuts compared to what people can make in the country because Im_going to bring jobs back from Mexico which is booming booming I have a friend who builds plants and hes a great builder of plants and I was with him the other day -- great guy He builds massive plants for automobiles for computers for anything Thats what he does I_think hes the biggest but certainly one of the biggestAnd I said hows it going He said unbelievable Oh good thats good news The countrys doing well No the countrys not doing well but Mexico is unbelievable The plants Im building in Mexico Ive never seen anything -- its the eighth wonder of the world And hes not happy Hes an American guy Hed rather build them here But he said its unbelievable Thats whats happened to our country Because we have leadership that doesnt know what theyre doingQUESTION (inaudible) special extreme vettingTRUMP Yes were going to be listing yeah were going to be giving a list of those territories And if you come from those territories we have extreme vetting And were going to have extreme vetting anyway Look we have people coming into this country who have very evil intentions And we have people whether in San Bernardino or whether its the World Trade Center or whether its a lot of other things and you look all over the world and you see whats happeningYou look at Orlando how bad was that And that was horrible That was going after the gay community it looks like We cant let this happen We cannot let this happen We cannot let people come inNow Hillary_Clinton likes to up it Her running mate Tim Kaine who by the way did a terrible job in New_Jersey First act he did in New_Jersey was ask for a $4 billion tax increase and hes not very popular in New_Jersey And he still isnt WhatI mean Virginia The first thing he did the first thing that Tim Kaine did he asked for a $4 billion tax increase And hes not very popular So let me just tell_you and I went all over Virginia and I was there the other day And I thought hed be popular Hes not popular because he asked for tax increases Big tax increases in Virginia Big And also the unemployment went up I_think it doubled or close to doubled during his tenureBut what he wanted to do is very strongly and hes on record he wanted to have even more of the people from that region of the world come in than Hillary_Clinton wants And its unacceptable OK Yes (inaudible)QUESTION Shortly ago prosecutors in Baltimore announced they were dropping all the chargesTRUMP I saw thatQUESTION Against police involved in the Freddie Gray caseTRUMP RightQUESTION Your reaction (inaudible)TRUMP I do have a reaction to the prosecutor in Baltimore who indicted those police officers I do I_think she ought to prosecute herself OK Thats my reaction I_think it was disgraceful what she did and the way she did it And the news_conference that she had where they were guilty before anybody even knew the factsAnd I give a lot of respect and a lot of credit to those police officers who probably could have made a deal I give a lot of respect a lot of credit that they stuck it out And you had victory after victory after victory And she had no chance dont forget she prosecuted the best case what she thought was her best cases first She should prosecute herself She should be held accountableQUESTION (inaudible) to Americans who feel like this was kind of a railroad case Freddie Gray is now a cause celebreTRUMP Well that was a bad case to prove it That was a bad case I_mean if youre going to do that its OK because you have to you know there are times when police officers behave very badly But you have to get the right time This was not one of those times And I_think that she is a disgrace to the world of prosecutors for what she did Yes maamQUESTION So as youve gotten to know Governor Pence what surprises you most about himTRUMP YeahQUESTION And (inaudible)TRUMP I have a great relationship with Governor Pence We spent the last three days together He was absolutely my first choice and I never wavered despite the press The press was saying and it was interesting I spoke to him at 1105 him and his wife and I told him that I was going to be choosing them if Id be lucky enough for him to accept And he accepted And that was it For me that was itBut right around that time you had the attack in Nice And I was going to have a news_conference either the following morning or the next day And of course I had to delay the news_conference because there was attack a horrible attack horrible In France And I delayed the news_conference and everyone said oh hes having second thoughts I never had a second thought in my_life It was such a lie I_mean so many lies in the press But it was such a lie And he has been so great Honestly hes been even better than I thought OK BetterQUESTION Do you think the Geneva Convention are out of dateTRUMP I_think everythings is out of date We have a whole new world When I said that NATO to Wolf Blitzer is obsolete I got attacked Three days later people that study NATO said you know Trump is right You_know what We have a lot of things that are out date because theyre 20 and 30 and 40 years oldNATO you know this isnt a country from 40 years_ago Today we have a different threat We have a terror threat And we have an ISIS threat And by the way ISIS isnt even mentioned Its not even mentioned during the Democratic Convention And everyones talking_about it The reason they cant mention it is because they grew itGo aheadQUESTION What would you renegotiate the enhanced interrogation aspect of it TheTRUMP I would -- Katy I would renegotiate so much of everything Im_going to renegotiate our trade deals where were losing with everybody Katy Im_going to renegotiate our military deals where were protecting countries and theyre not living up to the bargain Theyre not living up to the bargain And everyone agrees with me except for the mediaAnd the media never says that I like NATO just so you understand I like NATO I like the concept of NATO It is somewhat outdated because it doesnt cover terror the way it should Ive been saying this for six months now A couple of months_ago front page Wall_Street Journal We are going to cover terror they announced (ph) somebodyI think NATOs great But its got to be modernized And -- and countries that were protecting have to pay what theyre supposed to be payingQUESTION On the Geneva Convention (inaudible)TRUMP YesQUESTION Do you think that they should allow for that given the (inaudible)TRUMP I am a person that believes in enhanced interrogation yesAnd by the way it worksQUESTION (inaudible) will you defend the Baltic states if theyre invaded by Russia According toTRUMP Ill tell_you what Let_me say it once again Let_me say it once again OK Many countries including the NATO countries some of which I_think you have five that are current that have paid what they owe And they can afford to pay this Its not like they cant afford itThey just see us as a soft touch You_know in business we say somebodys a soft touch I dont_know if Ive been called a soft touch but maybe I have sometimes But in business they call them a soft touch They havent paid us OK I want them to payExcuse me Im not saying anything I dont talk Im not like Obama where he tells you everything hes going to do -- were going to go and do this were going to go and do that I dont talk But theyre going to payNo no -- yeah it sends a signal You_know what signal it says It says were going to payYou know somebody said but we have treaties I said thats right And in the treaties theyre supposed to pay Theyre going to pay And they will pay They will pay(CROSSTALK)TRUMP YesQUESTION (inaudible) how are you planning to (inaudible)TRUMP Were going

ClintonTRUMP I dont_think he respects Clinton I dont_think Putin has any respect whatsoever for Clinton I_think he does respect me And I hope I get along great with him Its possible that we wont Jeremy I hope that we get along great with Putin because it would be great to have Russia with a good relationshipRight now we dont have a good relationship Putin has said things over the last_year that are really bad things OK He mentioned the N word one time I was shocked to hear him mention the N word You_know what the N word is right He mentioned it I was shockedHe has a total lack of respect for President_Obama Number one he doesnt like him And number two he doesnt respect him I_think hes going to respect your president if Im elected And I hope he likes meYes Yes sirQUESTION (inaudible) relationsTRUMP Yes sir(CROSSTALK)TRUMP But let me finish with Jeremy Go_aheadQUESTION Would a President Trump be better for US-Russia relations than (inaudible)TRUMP President Trump would

position(CROSSTALK)TRUMP No wait a minute(CROSSTALK)TRUMP No Im not going to be an adversary No not at all I have tenants from China I have the biggest bank in the world from China paying me rent

if China can get away with trade deficits every year of hundreds of billions of dollars -- if they can get away with that my hats off to themI have no problem with China I have a problem with our incompetent leadership allowing that to happen And I believe that Hillary_Clinton is even more bought and paid for than Barack_Obama I_think it will get worseIts going to be four more years of Obama which is unacceptable to a lot of people you see that But I believe that Hillary_Clinton will be worse than ObamaYesQUESTION (OFF-MIKE) you mentioned that you wanted to make college education more affordableTRUMP Thats rightQUESTION Working on a planTRUMP Thats right Im_going to be doing something over the next four weeks very much soQUESTION Are you prepared to give us any sort ofTRUMP No Im

Im_going to Toledo (ph) and Im_going to different places today and Ive met so many people This is such a great country these are such great people one of the saddest things I see are college students that work so hard that go to colleges good colleges theyre good students they do a great jobNumber one they get out they have no jobs Because our jobs are going to Mexico theyre going to China theyre going to Japan theyre going all over the place Theyre not coming here Just like my friend who builds the plants but he doesnt build them here muchAnd the saddest thing I see is these students are leveraged debt up to their -- up to their neck They cant breathe theyre scared theyre so scared they have leveraged their entire life They have loansAnd I have to tell_you the colleges are viewing the students as just a con to it Because the students get government money passes through but the number gets higher and higherBecause college costs are out of control because the colleges say what difference does it make If you take a look at the salaries being paid you take a look at whats going on with the collegesBecause all of this is a pass through and the students are a con to it So the colleges are costing so much money We are going to help the students Maybe that doesnt fit beautifully within the Republican frameworkBut I told this during various times to lots of different people and nobody has a problem with it We have to help our students Our students are under tremendous pressure to a point where its making them sickOur students are under tremendous pressure we have to help our students And Im_going to have a plan over the next four weeks(CROSSTALK)QUESTION (OFF-MIKE) talking_about possiblyTRUMP Everythings on the table youll see Everything -- its a very important -- its a very important subjectYes maamQUESTION Mr Trump (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I_think my message is resonating because they have confidence on me at the border if they dont_want people pouring into our country Likewise they have confidence with me on ISIS not only in terms of getting rid of them but also in terms of keeping them out of our country because I will not have people come into our country who want to do damage to our peopleI think they have a lot of confidence in terms of my bringing back jobs because I see Carrier and I see Ford and I see all of these companies leaving and going to Mexico like theres nothing to it And then they make their product they sell it back to the United_States no tax no nothing we get nothing except unemploymentAnd I_think people see that I can tell_you I_mean Im like a pollster myself when Im in front of these massive audiences one of the things that gets constantly -- you people know because youre there -- the biggest applause is a repeal and replacement of ObamacareBecause Obamacare is a disaster In Texas going through BlueCross/BlueShield they just announced a 60 percent increase On November 1st youre going to have new numbers come out for Obamacare having to do with increases President_Obama is trying to get it moved to December Because it is election-defying It is going to be a massive number the biggest number ever in our countrys history for health_care Its going to be announced on November 1stI just asked the press dont let him do that Obamacare is a disaster people are dying with it Its a disaster and everybody knows and its going to fold anywayIn 17 unfortunately -- if Im president -- I_mean Ive got to take over this mess Its going to fold anyway But repeal and replace Obamacare people like itThey like the fact that Im_going to protect the Second Amendment they like the fact that Im_going to rebuild our military which is very depleted Those are the things that are resonatingAnd they dont feel Hillary_Clinton can do itJohn (ph) go ahead John (ph)QUESTION (OFF-MIKE) Russia has no business in you -- that you dont have anyTRUMP No I have nothing to do with Russia John (ph) How many times do I have say that Are you a smart man I have nothing to with Russia I have nothing to do with RussiaAnd even -- for anything What do I have to do with Russia You_know the closest I came to Russia I bought a house a number of years_ago in Palm_Beach FloridaPalm Beach is a very expensive place There was a man who went bankrupt and I bought the house for $40 million and I sold it to a Russian for $100 million including brokerage commissions So I sold it So I bought it for 40 I told it for 100 to a Russian That was a number of years_ago I guess probably I sell condos to Russians OKQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Of course I can I told you other than normal stuff -- I buy a house if I sold it to a Russian I have nothing to do with Russia I said that Putin has much better leadership qualities than Obama but who doesnt know thatQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Of course not I own the Trump organization Zero zero Go_aheadQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I amQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I didQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP I did Because I would love to see a woman become president of the United_States But she would be so wrong And even women say that Women dont like her She would be so wrong Look Hillary_Clinton is a disaster Shes been a disaster And even the story told by her_husband last night he left out the most interesting chapter I wont get into thatThe chapter that I really waited for because it was pretty boring the chapter that I waited for I never heard And he left it out Look Hillary_Clintons a disaster Id love to see a woman become president and itll happen absolutely But I_think it would be bad for women if it were Hillary_Clinton Yes maam (ph)QUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Yes I doQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP But I have spoken to about many times and I speak about it all the time and the police have to be very careful they have to be very very well trained I speak about it all the time in fact I mentioned the most recent death excuse me I mentioned the most recent deaths in Louisiana and in Minnesota I speak about it all the time Its a real problem because if the police do 100000 great jobs and they have one either a rogue policeman or a cop who was poorly trained or did a bad job you see that incident on television for weeks Its a real problemYou dont see the good work that they do but if they make one mistake out of 100000 out of more_than that its on television night after night after night The police in this country do an amazing job but likewise I agree and I do mention that all the time Yes maam go_aheadQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Oh go ahead go_aheadQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP YesQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP No but they seem to be if its Russians I have no idea Its probably not Russia Nobody knows if its Russia You_know the sad thing is That with the technology and the genius we have in this country not in government unfortunately but with the genius we have in government we dont even know who took the Democratic_National Committee e-mails We dont even know who it isI heard this morning one report said they dont_think its Russia they think it might be China Another report said it might be just a hacker some guy with a 200 IQ that cant get up in the morning OK Nobody knows Honestly they have no idea if its Russia Might be Russia But if its any foreign country it shows how little respect they have for the United_States Yes maamQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP YesQUESTION (OFF-MIKE)TRUMP Well and (ph) the biggest thing is number one we have to stop by keeping people out because these people theyve got something bad going on up there Thats something really bad going on And then people in terms of Islam and radical Islamic terrorism a term that our president refuses to use I cant hes still not using it Hes still not using it And she doesnt want to use it other than I forced her into maybe using it She said she will use it but so_far she didntShell probably use it tonight Like the American flags as soon as we put out a thing they ran a couple of American flags up in the stage it was a disgrace You had a room with a massive stage without flags I_think this -- I_think that the people in the community know whats going on Whether its in a mosque or whether its in the community and they have to report these people When you look at San Bernardino people knew -- many people knew what was going on They had bombs lying all over the floor They had bombs on the floor I_mean this isnt -- you walk into somebodys house there are bombs lying on the floor -- I_think theres a problem there You got to report itAnd by the way David Hinckley should not have been freed OK David Hinckley was just released -- John Hinckley -- I_think that John Hinckley -- excuse me John Hinckley should not have been freed I just heard about it(CROSSTALK)QUESTION Do you have any pause (ph) about asking a foreign government -- Russia China anybody -- to interfere to hack into the system of anybodys in this countryTRUMP Thats up to the President Let the President talk to them Look heres the problem Heres the problem Katy (ph) Katy heres the problem very simple He has no respectQUESTION (inaudible) 30000 e-mailsTRUMP Well they probably have them Id like to have them releasedQUESTION Does that not give you pauseTRUMP No it gives me no pause If they have them they have them We might as well -- hey you know what gives me more pause That a person in our government crooked Hillary_Clinton -- heres what gives me pause Be quiet I know you want to save her That a person in our government Katy would delete or get rid of 33000 e- mails That gives me a big problem After she gets a subpoena She gets subpoenaed and she gets rid of 33000 e-mails That gives me a problem (ph) Now if Russia or China or any other country has those e-mails I_mean to be honest with you Id love to see them(CROSSTALK)QUESTION A question about Mike_Pence because The New_York Times reported that (inaudible) conversation with John Kasichs campaign (inaudible) says you can be the most_powerful (inaudible)TRUMP Thats the most ridiculous conversation He never had the -- Don Jr told me -- let me just tell_you Let_me save you a lot of boredomQUESTION (inaudible) Mike Pences role as vice_president if you are electedTRUMP Mike_Pence will play a big role but I just want to tell_you about John Kasich I never spoke to him about being vice_president We dont have good chemistry together I have never spoken to him about being vice_president I would never pick him to be vice_president There was never a conversation and he has a habit of doing things like this where he says things that may be a little_bit shaky He never spoke -- Don Jr would never -- and that was so long ago I didnt even know I was going to get the nomination at that point Just so you understand I would not have picked John Kasich wouldnt be the right guy I_mean for that to have gotten out that was so ridiculous And then I was going to put him in charge of national and worldwide policy So whats left for the president I_think you know me better than that That was put out by him Hes a nice man John Kasich hes fine Hes fine I would never have chosen himNow I did speak to various people and I actually got acceptances from many people There are some people that called me that very much wanted to be vice_president but I picked a man that I have a lot of respect for and Mike_Pence is doing a great jobLet me just explain -- I never asked John Kasich to be vice_president nor would I And by the way Im leading in Ohio by three pointsQUESTION (inaudible)TRUMP It probably has It probably has Our government is so weak on this stuff It probably has Possible I_mean I have a lot of checks and balance I have a good system I guess Im not an e- mail person myself I dont believe in it because I_think it can be hacked for one thing But when I send an e-mail I_mean if I send one I send one almost never Im just not a believer in e-mail A lot of people have taught me that including Hillary But honestly it could be maybe its hacked Who knowsQUESTION (inaudible) broken the rules in traditional American politics many times (ph) (inaudible) while the other personTRUMP Yes but my message wasnt dark My message was optimistic because were going to fix the problems Go_aheadQUESTION (inaudible)TRUMP OKQUESTION Youve broken that tradition youve run a very aggressive campaign this week (ph) What was the basis for wanting to do it this way as opposed to staying quietTRUMP No basis No basisLook John I didnt have to do this When I did this believe me -- you see this incredible resort Its one of

when Bernie_Sanders makes a statement that I wanted to go lower than the minimum_wage lower its a lie So I have a choice All my people say dont respond to it it doesnt matter I say to me it does matter It mattersWhen people tell lies politicians who tell lies very well thats what they do thats why theyre politicians But when politicians tell lies and Im lucky in a sense because I have a big microphone In other words I can say that Biden lied when he said that Or I can say that I didnt say that Bernie_Sanders And you guys know that I didnt In fact he was criticized by people that fact

sleazeball and a pervert And Im not saying that I_mean thats recorded history rightI dont like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets OK So how can Hillary_Clinton be

dont_think that I know at some point theyre going to be calling theyre going to want to brief me but Im not a talker about this stuffI dont_think that its safe to have Hillary_Clinton in light of what

(Inaudible) running for the president (inaudible)TRUMP Might as well tell him to have a good time He has done one bad jobOK thank you everybodyOn Monday_night on CNN Carl Bernstein made this proclamation The president and his presidency is in chaosIts a remarkable statement given that we are only 11_days into the presidency of Donald Trump Its also very hard to disputeConsider this amazing and I do mean amazing WaPo story today about The story details the infighting and blame game among Trumps top advisers and includes some eye-popping linesAmong them* Defense Secretary James Mattis and Homeland_Security Secretary John Kelly fumed privately to associates over the weekend because they had been caught unaware by a travel_ban that was drafted and set into action largely in secret by the White_House according to three people who have spoken with them*The problem theyve got is this is an off-Broadway performance of a show that is now the number one hit on Broadway said former House speaker Newt Gingrich of the Trump administration (Sidebar Gingrich is an informal adviser to Trump)*A little_bit of under-competence and a slight amount of insecurity can breed some paranoia and backstabbing one White_House official said of White_House chief of staff Reince Priebus We have to get Reince to relax into the job and become more competent because hes seeing shadows where there are no shadowsAny one of those lines is problematic in a normal White_House The quote from an anonymous White_House official about Priebus who let me emphasize is the is stunning If that line was used in House of Cards I would roll my eyes and say it would never happen in real lifeAnd its not just the Post story that shows the seeming tumult among Trumps senior advisers A in the Wall_Street Journal on Tuesday details how Department of Homeland_Security chief John Kelly is at odds with the White_House over staffing in his organization A Vanity Fair details the struggles of Trump son-in-law and White_House adviser Jared_Kushner as he seeks to exert influence over the presidentRead any one of those stories and the word chaos jumps to mind Or turmoil Or dissension All of them convey the same thing Less than two weeks into his presidency there is a knife fight happening daily among Trumps top aidesBernstein clearly meant his chaos comments in a negative way Chaos in traditional political thinking is bad It suggests a president who doesnt really have control over his people and a White_House that resembles a roller coaster car shuddering as it travels at too high a speed down the tracksAnd maybe thats all true Its possible that the Trump train is on the verge of jumping the tracks (Mixed metaphor alert)But every indication from what we know of Trump the businessman and reality TV star suggests that he revels in the chaos that he believes the chaos produces just the sort of results he likesThink back to the boardroom on The Apprentice Bring everybody in Let them attack one another and level allegations Consult with a few of your consiglieres and then make a bold and often unpredictable decision Yes that was a TV show But it was a TV show created by Trump (and Mark Burnett) That means that the way the show worked came directly out of Trumps brain and generally speaking represents his view of how things should workRemember that for Trump appearances matter most And he likes the perception of himself as the decider the buck-stopper the only one who can cut through all of the noise and battling egos to make the call In order to make that image truly work you need noise around you at all times So Trump put in place a senior leadership team that would create itThe other important point here is that Trump believes all of life business and politics included amounts to a sort of survival of the fittest/toughest His critique of Hillary_Clintons health during the 2016 campaign was based on the idea that anyone who has a weak moment as Clinton did at a 9/11 memorial service cant possibly be up to the top job in the country For Trump the constant battles between his aides are a sort of real-life Survivor episode The toughest SOB is the one Trump wants And only through political combat can that be determinedThe combination of chaos combat and constant sniping is not a bad thing in the worldview of Donald Trump In fact it is the one truly necessary thingIn the three years before he became Donald Trumps chief_strategist Stephen_K Bannon lived as a virtual nomad in a quest to build a populist political insurgency No presidential adviser in recent memory has followed such a mysterious peripatetic path to the White_House It was as though he was a man with no fixed addressHe owned a house and condo in Southern California where he had entertainment and consulting businesses a drivers license and a checking account He claimed Florida as his residence registering to vote in Miami and telling authorities he lived at the same address as his third ex-wifeAt the same_time he routinely stayed in Washington and New_York as he engineered the expansion of Breitbart_News and hosted a live Breitbart radio program By 2015 Bannon stayed so often at Breitbarts townhouse headquarters on Capitol_Hill that he kept a picture of a daughter on a mantle piece beneath a portrait of Abraham Lincoln Bannon told a friend that year he was living in multiple cities including Washington New_York London and Miami according to an email obtained by The Washington PostThe issue of Bannons legal residency has been simmering since last_summer shortly_after he became chief_executive of Trumps campaign that he was registered to vote at a then-vacant house and speculated that Bannon may have signed an oath that he was a Florida resident to take advantage of the states lack of state income taxesIn California where Bannon had lived and owned property for more_than two_decades income tax can exceed 12 percentBannon has not responded to repeated requests by The Washington_Post to discuss the matter Two Post reporters sought to independently verify his residency claims using a wide array of publicly available information They obtained utility bills court records real_estate transactions state driver reports and the checks he wrote to pay municipal taxes in California They interviewed neighbors spoke with landlords and tracked his Breitbart-related activityIn the digital age when most Americans leave a clear footprint of their whereabouts Bannon left a meandering trail filled with ambiguity contradictions and questions The_Post found that Bannon left a negligible footprint in Florida He did_not get a Florida drivers license or register a car in the state He never voted in Florida and neighbors near two homes he leased in Miami said they never saw him His rent and utility bills were sent to his business manager in California Bannons former wife occupied the premises according to a landlord and neighborsAt the same_time Bannon said he was living with his ex-wife she was under investigation for involvement in a plot to smuggle drugs and a cellphone into a Miami jail a law_enforcement document obtained by The_Post shows The_Post learned that state prosecutors in Miami have an active investigation_into Bannons assertions that he was a Florida resident and qualified to vote in the state from 2014 to 2016 In late August investigators subpoenaed Bannons lease of a Coconut Grove home and other documents They also contacted the landlords of that home and another that Bannon leased nearby and sought information from a gardener and handyman who worked at one of the homes according to documents and interviewsBecause state laws do not clearly define residency making a false registration case can be difficult A former investment banker and Hollywood producer Bannon lived in California when he took a turn toward politics nearly a decade ago He had a condo in Los Angeles and a house just to the south in Laguna Beach in Orange County In 2010 he told Orange County election officials that he wanted to become a permanent absentee voter and have all ballots mailed to his Laguna Beach homeIn 2011 Bannon produced and directed a political documentary about Sarah Palin for the Victory Film Project a company in Sarasota Fla He is listed as a manager of the company in Florida corporate records In March 2012 with the death of founder Andrew Breitbart Bannon became executive chairman of the Los Angeles-based Breitbart_News which was expanding its operations to Washington Bannon was still a resident of California records_show In the November 2012 elections he voted in Orange County by absentee ballot That same month he renewed his California drivers license for five yearsBut in his subsequent travels across the country his living situation became more complicated The details gathered by The_Post create uncertainty about where exactly he was spending the bulk of his timeOn Feb 9 2013 Bannon and Diane Clohesy his former third wife signed a lease application for a three-bedroom house on Opechee_Drive in a lush Miami neighborhood with palm trees and Spanish-style homes Bannon signed as applicant and Clohesy signed as applicants spouseThe two were married in 2006 when Bannon was 53 and Clohesy was 36 They divorced in California in 2009 She had moved to Florida in 2008 starting a new life in Miami Bannon said in court_papers during the divorce But the two remained in touch and she worked on three political documentaries he directed in 2011 and 2012 Bannon told his new landlords that he would be splitting his time between California and Florida according to interviews The_Post conducted with the property owners Bannon and Clohesy both signed the two-yearlease records showThe lease application said Bannon was relocating from California But Devin Kammerer the real_estate agent who represented Bannon and Clohesy said he never met Bannon in person and only sent him listings by emailIt was Diane who made the decisions about where she wanted to be and shed send over listings to Steve for his approval Kammerer said Diane was very clear on what she wanted The $4900 monthly rent was a big jump for Clohesy who declared on the lease application that her most recent apartment had cost her $950 a month documents_show But by his own account Bannon could afford it He stated on the application that he earned $750000 a year as chairman of Breitbart_News Network a figure that has not been previously reported He also earned $270000 as executive chairman of Arc Entertainment a film distribution company based in Santa Monica Calif In_addition Bannon received about $100000 in salary that year as part-time chairman of the Government Accountability Institute a new nonprofit charity in Tallahassee according to filings with the Internal Revenue Service Bannon two Breitbart writers and other conservative activists had launched the organization a year earlier and it produced reports and books that were promoted by Breitbart Bannon claimed he worked 30 hours a week at GAI according to IRS filingsJust weeks after signing the Opechee_Drive lease Bannon launched Breitbart_News Sunday with Stephen_K Bannon a three-hour program broadcast live Sunday nights from SiriusXM studios in Washington In May 2013 Bannon opened an account in his name for municipal sewer and water service at the Opechee_Drive residence documents showThe utility account is one of the few public indications of Bannons presence in Florida But Bannon told utility officials to mail the bills to the office of his business manager on Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills Calif according to documents obtained through Florida public records lawsFour neighbors told The_Post they do not recall seeing Bannon at the houseI never saw him said Steven Chastain who lived a few doors away on a nearby street He wasnt living there said Barbara Pope a longtime resident who often walked her dog on Opechee_Drive I would have recognized him At the time Bannon was sharing the lease with Clohesy in Opechee she was apparently involved with another man Neighbors said they repeatedly saw a man they could not identify at the house She filed for a restraining order against Jose A Cabana in 2012 He filed one against her in May 2013 court records_show She was granted a two-year injunction against him and his complaint was dropped after he failed to appear in court Cabana was charged with cocaine distribution in November 2013 and sentenced to 10 years in prison He could not be reached for commentIn October 2013 Clohesy became ensnared in an undercover investigation of a jail guard suspected of smuggling drugs and other contraband to another man a friend of hers in the Miami-Dade County Pre-trial Detention Center according to an arrest warrant for the jail guard Investigators eavesdropping on a phone_call between Clohesy and the inmate heard them arrange for her to deliver a pop tart code for a cellphone along with several ounces of marijuana to a prison guard the warrant said Clohesy who was under surveillance later met with the guard in a parking lot and handed over the marijuana the phone and $700 in cash the warrant said Clohesy was confronted by authorities and agreed to cooperate She told investigators she had known the inmate for more_than a year and maintained a relationship with him through jail visits correspondence and telephone conversationsEfforts to reach Clohesy were unsuccessful Her brother Declan provided The_Post with that Bannon had provided emotional or financial support to help her recover from drug addiction and depressionSteve is a caring and compassionate man and Diane is blessed to still have him in her life the statement said We appreciate the media respecting my sisters privacy at this early stage of her recovery Neighbors of the Opechee_Drive home said they remember Clohesy vividly in part because she had a steady stream of visitors some of them disruptive Four neighbors told The_Post that they had a community meeting with police to complain about noise at the house and cars speeding from the premises at late hoursPolice records_show that officers went to the Opechee address at_least three times over several months in 2014 The officers were responding to reports about disturbances including loud music In one case a woman at the home called police around midnight to express fears about an ex-boyfriend who was shining a bright light into the windows Her name is redacted in the reportBeatriz Portela a real_estate agent who represented the Opechee landlords said she also received a call and text messages from neighbors who were anxious about troubling incidents at the house including speeding vehicles and a car crash They were super upset Portela said On April 2 2014 more_than a year after Bannon signed the lease on the residence in Coconut Grove he registered to vote in Florida and listed the Opechee_Drive address as his legal home Bannon did_not have to show an ID to register He provided the last four digits of his Social Security number to verify his identityOne of the allures of Florida is its zero income tax rate for in-state residents The_Post was unable to determine what state Bannon claimed as his primary residence for the purpose of income tax Accountants advise people who work in multiple states to carefully document the number of nights they spend in Florida and maintain records of travel housing even of meals Registering to vote is considered one indication of residency as is a drivers license Under state law new residents must apply for a license within 30 days if they intend to operate a vehicle Phillip Sroka a partner at the accounting firm of Morrison Brown Argiz and Farra in Miami said he advises clients who split their time in multiple states to take care to document their presence in Florida for more_than six months That includes airline tickets restaurant receipts and utility billsIn an interview with The_Post Sroka said suspicions are raised when individuals have their bills sent outside the states where they claim their residencesIt gets a little sketchy when you accept employment elsewhere he said Where it gets a little on the line and subject to interpretation is where you have a lot of other business_dealings elsewhere As 2015 approached Bannon continued his roving life He rented out his Laguna Beach home and in January 2015 bought a townhouse as a second home in Pinehurst NC The deed lists Bannons mailing address at his money managers office in Beverly HillsOn Feb 18 2015 Bannon ended the water and sewer service at Opechee_Drive and switched the service to Onaway Drive less_than a half mile away in Coconut Grove records_show Five days later Bannon changed his voter registration to Onaway DriveThe Opechee house was left in disrepair according to an email between the landlord and Bannon and interviews with the landlordPadlocks had been placed on interior doors or the doors had been removed altogether A hot tub was destroyed[E]ntire Jacuzzi bathtub seems to have been covered in acid the landlord wrote in the February 2015 email to Bannon Im out of town Bannon replied is there any way u can talk with Diane and sort things out The damage was estimated at more_than $14000 according to an accounting by the landlords who kept the $9800 security deposit from Bannon and Clohesy Kammerer their real_estate agent said he was troubled by the damageI would not work with them after that he said I would not refer them again as clients of mine Around this time Bannon was becoming a fixture at the Breitbart_News townhouse location in Washington nicknamed the Breitbart Embassy hosting parties meeting with journalists and staying overnightIn a reporter described interviewing Bannon multiple times in January and February at the Breitbart townhouse in WashingtonThe article headlined This Man Is the Most Dangerous Political Operative in America described the building as a 14-room townhouse that [Bannon] occupiesOrdinarily Bannons townhouse is crypt-quiet and feels like a museum as its faithfully decorated down to its embroidered silk curtains and painted murals in authentic Lincoln-era details the article said On Oct 26 2015 SiriusXM announced that Bannons weekend radio show would expand its live broadcasts to weekday mornings from 6 am to 9 am from studios in Washington and New_York Donald Trump was a guest on the inaugural show Nov 2Five months later Bannon shut off sewer and water service at the Onaway address in Miami The house remained uninhabited for monthsThree neighbors interviewed by The_Post said they were confident Bannon had not lived at the homeI often saw Diane said Joseph JL Plummer a prominent Miami resident who lived next door and was a city commissioner for nearly 30_years I never saw himIn mid-August Bannon became chief_executive of the Trump campaign As he was assuming control Bannon changed the address on his Florida voter registration records On Aug 19 he signed an oath that he now lived at the home of a longtime business associate in Nokomis Fla in Sarasota County The questions about Bannons residency emerged Aug 26 when the Guardian wrote that Bannon had been registered to vote at a vacant house the Onaway address in MiamiThe local NBC station in Miami reported that the state attorneys office had requested Bannons voter records from county election officials At least two people filed complaints about Bannon with the Florida Department of State claiming he had committed voter fraud by asserting he was a resident documents_show In October the department said the complaints did_not merit an investigation That month Bannon registered to vote in New_York from a Manhattan condo overlooking Bryant Park and later cast an absentee ballot in the presidential_election Because he was registered in two places he was later removed from Floridas voter rollsUnder Florida law it is a third-degree felony to provide false information on a voter registration application It is punishable by up to five_years in prison First-time offenders are rarely given more_than probation something that could also lead to the loss of a security clearanceOfficials from the State Attorneys Office for Miami-Dade County which is led by an elected Democrat declined to provide details about their probe into Bannons residency claim In denying a Post request for documents about the investigation officials cited confidentiality rules for active criminal investigative informationSpokesman Ed Griffith said At this point it is not overBut proving wrongdoing in Bannons case could be difficult because state law does_not clearly define residency according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymityFacing an upcoming electoral challenge from a populist far-right party Dutch Prime MinisterMark Rutte released an open letter

Party for Freedom (PVV)Wilders has capitalized on a populist backlash to refugees and migrants in the Netherlands over the past few years and some have shown support for the PVV nearly equalto VVD ahead of the voteThe populist leader would struggle toform a coalition even if his party won a large amount of votes however Most mainstream parties including the VVD have refused to work with Wilders who was recently convicted of insulting an ethnic group and inciting discrimination after he Ruttes letter didnt mention Wilders by name but it did appear tomildly criticizethe PVVsrhetoric arguing that the solution is not [to] blame a group of people because of one persons actions Among observers however the prime ministers message was widely interpreted as an attempt to appeal to Wilderss supporters ahead of an increasingly competitive electionCas Mudde a Dutch political scientist at the University of Georgia who studies the European populist radical right said Rutte was trying to show right-wing voters that he could be as tough on immigration and law and order as the PVV It is thinly veiled nativism completely ignoring the anti-refugees violence physical and verbal by natives that the country has experienced in the past years MuddesaidWilders responded to Ruttes letter with a flurry of tweets Monday accusing the prime_minister of stealing his positions Wilders also suggested that Ruttewas being hypocritical as he wasthe man of open borders the asylum tsunami mass immigration Islamization lies and deceptionMark Rutte de man van de open grenzen de asieltsunami de massaimmigratie de islamisering de leugens en het bedrog Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv)AMSTERDAM When Dutch voters go to the polls Wednesday far-right leader Geert Wilders is hoping they will deliver the West its third major populist jolt in less_than a year and the first since Donald Trump won the US presidency in NovemberBut there are growing indications that Trump may be more hindrance than help to Wilderss campaignAfter leading for nearly all of last_year and seeming to be in commanding position as 2017 got underway Wilderss Freedom_Party has fallen sharply in the past two months a period that coincides with the tumultuous dawn of the Trump presidencyIn surveys conducted in recent_days the Freedom_Party has even fallen out of first place slipping just behind the center-right party of Prime_Minister Mark RutteIn the hyper-fragmented world of Dutch politics there will be 28 parties on the ballot Wednesday analysts emphasize that the campaign remains fluid and Wilders could still wind up on top Wilderss own backers say they believe fervently that the polls are underestimating his support just as they did with Trump in the United StatesBut increasingly his competitors are using unfavorable comparisons to the US president to attack Wilders and to try to halt the populist wave that began with Britains vote last June to exit the European UnionThis is our chance to stop this trend Rutte said in a brief interview as he recently campaigned at an Amsterdam shopping mall Theres still a big risk that [Wilders] will be the biggest party But weve seen the chaos after Brexit and after the elections in America And we cant have that hereTrump is deeply unpopular in the Netherlands as he is across Western Europe And although Wilderss hardcore supporters are unlikely to be deterred by the comparisons to Trump they may be effective among those who want to shake up the system but not quite in the Trump has during his first weeks in officeTrump is the biggest antidote to Wilders said Geert Tomlow a former Freedom_Party candidate who still agrees with much of the partys agenda People are aware that a Wilders type of person wont give them the change theyre looking forThe drop in the polls for Wilders is just the latest evidence that a Trump backlash in Europe may be helping the political establishment fight back against the spread of nationalistic far-right movements across the continentIn Germany where parliamentary elections are due in September the long-beleaguered center-left Social Democrats saw a pronounced poll bump after leader Martin Schulz against Trump In France with a presidential vote just around the corner this spring centrist Emmanuel Macron has been gaining on the far-rights Marine Le_Pen in measures of first-round supportTrump and Wilders have much in common Both delight in bashing the political establishment and seek to mobilize voters with nativist anti-immigrant appeals Both also relish doling out bombast in 140-character bitesWilders took a cue from the US elections as to how Donald Trump has done this The whole point is to denounce people the media the establishment said Sijbrende Jong an analyst at The Hague Center for Strategic Studies Its politics on the basis of emotion Its completely devoid of contentEarly in the campaign Rutte seemed intent on stealing some of Wilderss emotional thunder by mimicking his message In an open letter Rutte called on people in the Netherlands to The letter appeared aimed_at immigrants who fail to integrate referring to people who are attacking our habits and rejecting our values who attack gay people who shout at women in short skirts or call ordinary Dutch people racistBut in the recent interview Rutte said the letter was targeted more broadly at anyone who fails to act normal including those who take extreme positions that demonize immigrants and refugeesJoost Sneller a candidate for the centrist D66 party said it was up to Wilderss opponents not to try to co-opt his message but to convince voters that theres a better wayAs a small country he said the Netherlands has only succeeded when its engaged with the world with commerce art and ideasIts open society versus closed society he said Weve been strong by being openThat message Sneller said is getting out His party has been gaining in the polls as Wilders and his allies decline and has edged into a virtual tie for third placeWhat we hear on the doorstep is We cant have Trump-like things happen here Sneller said Its time to stand upHouse Republican leaders plan to propose preserving the top income-tax rate for very wealthy people a last-minute adjustment to their plan to overhaul the tax code that they hope will assuage concerns that it will mainly benefit the rich according to four people briefed on the planning TuesdayGOP leaders had planned to collapse the seven existing income tax brackets into three brackets lowering the top rate from 396percent to 35percent but now will retain the top bracket for people earning more_than a certain threshold perhaps $1000000 the people saidThe detail was one of several that emerged Tuesday as GOP leaders scrambled to put the final touches on their plan widely seen as the last best chance for Trump and congressional Republicans to advance a major policy achievement this year Drafters planned to work through the night on the bill and unveil it Wednesday but later decided to delay it to Thursday said House Ways and Means Committee_Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex) its lead authorAfter a closed-door meeting of his panel Tuesday night Brady issued a statement saying In consultation with President Trump and our leadership team we have decided to release the bill text on Thursday He said they remain on schedule to take action and approve a bill next week The delay raises questions about whether Republicans have resolved all of their differences amid concerns that even a few defections could prevent the bill from passingThe bill will aim to slash corporate tax rates simplify taxes for individuals and families and lure the foreign operations of multinational firms back to the United_States with incentives and penaltiesThe decision to preserve a top rate signals that Republicans are eager to avoid the impression that their plan which has already come under attack as doing little to boost the middle class seeks only to reward wealthy Americans and corporations And the move could attract the support of more moderate RepublicansThe House and Senate plan to work on separate tracks to pass legislation by Thanksgiving and send a bill to President Trump for his signature by years end though many expect it will take longer than that if the effort succeeds at allIt will be the biggest tax event in the history of our country Trump promised on Tuesday during a meeting with business trade groups at the White_House a claim he has made repeatedly Later in a tweet he said the Republican House members are working hard (and late) toward the Massive Tax Cuts that they know you deserveIn a sign that House Republicans are willing to go only so_far to mollify concerns about inequality they plan to move ahead with a proposal to eliminate the estate tax though it would be phased out over a number of years They also will propose changes to tax-protected retirement savings plans such as 401(k)s in an effort to raise revenue But Brady said Tuesday those changes remained in flux and that 401(k)s might ultimately be left aloneOverall House Republicans say their plan will reduce federal tax revenue by $15trillion over the next decade Keeping the tax rate for people earning over $1million could reduce the impact on the deficit by about $200billion over a decade according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal BudgetHouse Majority_Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif) said Tuesday that Bradys tax plan would lower the corporate tax rate from 35percent to 20percent as demanded by Trump A new wrinkle was emerging late Tuesday however with concern growing that the corporate tax reduction might not be able to be made permanent if it proves too costlyBusiness leaders will fight hard to prevent Republicans from allowing the rate to go back up after several years but the GOP could be hamstrung because it cannot push into law a tax change that adds too_much to the deficitNumerous details of the tax proposal came during a briefing that House Speaker Paul D Ryan (R-Wis) had Tuesday afternoon with conservative activists Grover Norquist president of Americans for Tax Reform is one of the people who confirmed the 396percent rate would remain for the highest incomeOverall Im very happy with the bill said Adam Brandon who is chief_executive of FreedomWorks and attended the Ryan briefing My read is that everyone is going to be seeing a tax cutCurrently families pay the 396percent rate on income above $470700 so the proposal would still lower taxes for people who earn above the lower amountThe implications of the changes envisioned by GOP leaders could be far-reaching but numerous aspects remain uncertainThousands of companies that pay their taxes through the individual income-tax code would see their rates lowered on top income from 396percent to 25percent Its unclear_whether there would be new provisions to prevent more-wealthy individuals from creating companies to pay the 25percent rate on their income rather_than the higher rateThe new proposal is expected to include a new minimum tax that US companies will be required to pay on certain foreign earnings as a way to prevent them from moving US operations to low-tax countries Businesses are watching carefully how the House bill deals with US companies that produce goods overseas and then sell them back into the United StatesThe House GOP plan would also allow companies to immediately expense capital investments such as new equipment for five_years but cut back the ability to deduct interest paymentsMany businesses and the wealthy are expected to be the biggest beneficiaries according to initial versions of the plan while the impact on many in the middle class is disputed and less clearThe proposal would roughly double the standard deduction that many Americans can claim to exempt a portion of their income from taxation but it would also eliminate the personal exemption which tends to benefit families with multiple children But the tax plan is expected to expand the child tax credit something Ivanka Trump has said will help working familiesThe House GOP plan would allow Americans to deduct the property taxes they pay from their income but prohibit for the first time Americans from deducting the state and local income taxes they pay from their federal taxable income a simmering issue that threatens to rip apart the GOP coalition needed to approve the billThe plan would also abolish the alternative minimum tax a system set_up to ensure people do not claim so many deductions that they pay too little in taxes McCarthy saidThe economic success of the package hinges on controversial economic theories that assume large tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy will lead to economic growth and wage gains for everyone else a conclusion that economists and policymakers have debated for decadesBut Republicans have a rare lock of political power controlling the White_House House and Senate and are desperate to regain political footing lost after a number of missteps this year particularly the failure to rewrite health-care policyThe speed with which they are doing this is more about politics than it is about policy said Rep Richard E Neal (Mass) the ranking_Democrat on Bradys committee They dont_want people to see whats in it and I_think they need a victoryThe tax package is expected to reduce revenue by more_than $4trillion over 10 years Republicans hope to recoup some of that lost revenue by eliminating a number of tax breaks but they have been careful not to identify all of these changes in part because they expect a revolt from interest groups that would be affectedTheyve got $4trillion worth of tax promises and they basically at this point have got virtually no revenue in order to pay for it Sen Ron Wyden (D-Ore) said Tuesday So what they have done is basically made it clear that their promises to the middle class are really not worth the paper they are written on They are false promises to the middle classWhite House officials and GOP congressional leaders have met for months to try to establish the framework for rewriting the tax code but they agreed only on broad parameters Big tests now loom for Brady and his Senate counterpart Finance Committee_Chairman Orrin G Hatch (R-Utah) to craft legislation that can pass both chambersThe government collects roughly $4trillion a year in taxes and other revenue a threshold that still falls short of how_much money it spendsTrump says the changes could lead to an immediate jolt in economic growth saying on Tuesday that it could lead companies to bring more_than $4trillion in past foreign earnings back to the United_States He also said it would lead to a flood of companies moving back to the country lured by big tax cuts and the threat that their foreign earnings will be subject to stricter taxation for the first timeIt is details such as those though that will be the focus of several intense weeks of negotiations in the House and Senate GOP tax writers are also expected to have a much different approach to the taxation of profits overseasResolving these differences will be crucial because Republicans have signaled they will try to push the tax cuts into law without any support from Democrats testing the slim margin they control in the Senate and their balky caucus in the HouseGiven that they are trying to do this with a one-party approach they dont have a lot of flexibility said Alan Auerbach director of the Burch Center for Tax Policy and Public Finance at the University of California at Berkeley Heather Long contributed to this reportPolicy consultant Maya Rockeymoore Cummings one of two women vying to unseat Maryland Gov Larry

committee this week becomes lawIn general employersdont have that power under existing federal laws which protect genetic privacy and nondiscrimination But a bill passed Wednesday by theHouse Committee on Education and the Workforce would allow employers to get around thoseobstacles if the information is collected as part of a workplace wellness programSuchprograms which offer workers a variety ofcarrots and sticksto monitor and improve their health such as lowering cholesterol have become increasingly popularwith companiesSome offer discounts on health_insurance to employees who complete health-risk assessments Others might charge people more for smokingUnder the Affordable_Care Act employers are allowed to discount health_insurance premiums by up to 30 percent and in some cases 50 percent for employees who voluntarily participate in a wellness program where theyre required to meet certain health targets The bill is under review by other House committees and still must be considered by the Senate But it has already faced strong criticism from a broad array of groups as well as House Democrats In a letter sent to the committee earlier_this week representing consumer health and medical advocacy groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics AARP March of Dimes and the National Womens Law Center said the legislation if enacted would undermine basic privacy provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act and the 2008 Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act()Congress passed GINA to prohibit discrimination by health insurers and employers based on the information that people carry in their genes There is an exception that allows for employees to provide that information as part of voluntary wellness programs But the law states that employee participation must be entirely voluntary with no incentives for providing the dataor penalties for not providing itBut theHouse legislation would allow employers to impose penalties of up to 30

even so the official announcement of the execution of Jang Song Thaek is a step beyond The state-run Korean_Central News_Agency released a long article detailing the alleged crimes and transgressions of Jang a longtime senior regime official who was also the uncle of leader Kim_Jong UnIt really must be read to be believed A typical line asserts for example that Jang behaved so arrogantly and insolently as unwillingly standing up from his seat and half-heartedly clapping touching off towering resentment of our service personnel and people Here is how the release startsPYONGYANG December 13 0623 KST (KCNA) Upon hearing the report on the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers_Party of Korea the service personnel and people throughout the country broke into angry shouts that a stern judgment of the revolution should be meted out to the anti-party counter-revolutionary factional elements Against the backdrop of these shouts rocking the country a special military tribunal of the DPRK Ministry of State Security was held on December 12 against traitor for all ages Jang Song ThaekThe accused Jang brought together undesirable forces and formed a faction as the boss of a modern day factional group for a long time and thus committed such hideous crime as attempting to overthrow the state by all sorts of intrigues and despicable methods with a wild ambition to grab the supreme power of our party and stateThough North_Korea has had many political purges the highly public nature of this one has been unprecedented since Pyongyang first revealed it on Dec 8 when state TV showed uniformed troops escorting Jang out of a Politburo meeting The over-the-top language of this release although awfully easy for outsiders to laugh at is an important component of the purge -- and a potentially significant hint of whats_happening there and why Well have a fuller look at Jangs purge shortly so do check backThe full KCNA release is preserved here (state media has ) The rest of the release followsThe tribunal examined Jangs crimesAll the crimes committed by the accused were proved in the course of hearing and were admitted by himA decision of the special military tribunal of the Ministry of State Security of the DPRK was read out at the trialEvery sentence of the decision served_as sledge-hammer blow brought down by our angry service personnel and people on the head of Jang an anti-party counter-revolutionary factional element and despicable political careerist and tricksterThe accused is a traitor to the nation for all ages who perpetrated anti-party counter-revolutionary factional acts in a bid to overthrow the leadership of our party and state and the socialist systemJang was appointed to responsible posts of the party and state thanks to the deep political trust of President Kim_Il Sung and leader Kim_Jong Il and received benevolence from them more_than any others from long agoHe held higher posts than before and received deeper trust from supreme leader Kim_Jong Un in particularThe political trust and benevolence shown by the peerlessly great men of Mt Paektu were something he hardly deservedIt is an elementary obligation of a human being to repay trust with sense of obligation and benevolence with loyaltyHowever despicable human scum Jang who was worse than a dog perpetrated thrice-cursed acts of treachery in betrayal of such profound trust and warmest paternal love shown by the party and the leader for himFrom long ago Jang had a dirty political ambition He dared not raise his head when Kim_Il Sung and Kim_Jong Il were alive But reading their faces Jang had an axe to grind and involved himself in double-dealing He began revealing his true colors thinking that it was just the time for him to realize his wild ambition in the period of historic turn when the generation of the revolution was replacedJang committed such an unpardonable thrice-cursed treason as overtly and covertly standing in the way of settling the issue of succession to the leadership with an axe to grind when a very important issue was under discussion to hold respected Kim_Jong Un in high esteem as the only successor to Kim_Jong Il in reflection of the unanimous desire and will of the entire party and army and all peopleWhen his cunning move proved futile and the decision that Kim_Jong Un was elected vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Workers_Party of Korea at the Third Conference of the WPK in reflection of the unanimous will of all party members service personnel and people was proclaimed making all participants break into enthusiastic cheers that shook the conference hall he behaved so arrogantly and insolently as unwillingly standing up from his seat and half-heartedly clapping touching off towering resentment of our service personnel and peopleJang confessed that he behaved so at that time as a knee-jerk reaction as he thought that if Kim_Jong Uns base and system for leading the army were consolidated this would lay a stumbling block in the way of grabbing the power of the party and stateWhen Kim_Jong Il passed away so suddenly and untimely to our sorrow he began working in real earnest to realize its long-cherished greed for powerAbusing the honor of often accompanying Kim_Jong Un during his field guidance Jang tried hard to create illusion about him by projecting himself internally and externally as a special being on a par with the headquarters of the revolutionIn a bid to rally a group of reactionaries to be used by him for toppling the leadership of the party and state he let the undesirable and alien elements including those who had been dismissed and relieved of their posts after being severely punished for disobeying the instructions of Kim_Jong Il and kowtowing to him work in a department of the Central Committee of the WPK and organs under it in a crafty mannerJang did serious harm to the youth movement in our country being part of the group of renegades and traitors in the field of youth work bribed by enemies Even after they were disclosed and purged by the resolute measure of the party he patronized those cats paws and let them hold important posts of the party and stateThere are so many twists and turns in the story involving President Trump and his team and Russian_meddling in the 2016 US elections As a public service The Fact_Checker is keeping track of the various tentacles of this complex saga and highlighting any inconsistencies or falsehoods we can findReviewing our fact_checks so_far its clear that in many cases the White Houses rhetoric shifted as The Washington_Post or the New_York Times uncovered new information and revealed that officials were being misleading or obfuscating the truth with their rhetoric Since January 2017 we compiled numerous timelines just to keep track of what Trump and his aides said when they said it what the public knew at the time of their statements and how they shifted over time We also fact-checked misleading attacks by Democrats about actions by Trump administration officialsThe special_counsels investigation is underway so this story keeps evolving Each fact check and this roundup will be updated as new information becomes availableHeres a chronological compilation of 14 Trump-Russia fact_checks since January 2017 We linked to video fact_checks where available Click on the headline to read each columnOn Jan 6 2017 US intelligence_agencies published a high-confidence assessment that Russian President_Vladimir Putin ordered a cyberattack during the 2016_presidential election with the aim of undermining faith in the US democratic process and hurting Hillary_Clintons electability We decoded then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebuss spin misleading the public in an effort to play down the findings in the assessmentOn Feb 13 2017 then-national security_adviser Michael_Flynn was fired White_House officials knew for weeks that Flynn had misled about the nature of his December 2016 calls with Russian_Ambassador Sergey_Kislyak but he was only pressured to resign after The_Post uncovered it Flynns statements to The_Post shifted from an outright denial to a less equivocal one as The_Post uncovered more information We compiled a timeline of events dating to December 2016 that led to Flynns firingOn March 1 that Attorney_General Jeff_Sessions in 2016 had met twice with Russian_Ambassador Sergey_Kislyak but did_not disclose them in his Senate confirmation_hearing In a swipe at Sessions Sen Claire McCaskill (D-Mo) tweeted that she had no calls or meetings with the Russian_ambassador over her 10 years on the Senate Armed_Services Committee But we easily found earlier tweets from 2013 and 2015 that showed she did indeed have such interactions with the Russian_ambassador in the past McCaskill received Three PinocchiosHouse Minority Leader Nancy_Pelosi (D-Calif) rebuked Sessions for not disclosing his contacts with Kislyak and claimed Congress impeached President Bill_Clinton for something far less_than what Sessions had done But that description was a stretch While the Sessions and Clinton cases both involve statements made under oath the circumstances were vastly different (Later Sessions would recuse_himself from the Trump-Russia investigation due to his campaign contacts with Kislyak) Pelosi earned Two PinocchiosOn May 8 former acting attorney_general Sally Yates testified that she had informed White_House Counsel on Jan 26 that Flynn lied about the nature of his calls with Kislyak Yet it took 18 days and The Posts reporting for Trump to act In response to Yatess testimony Trump blamed former president Barack_Obama for giving Flynn a security clearance in the first place and elevating Flynn But this was just a distraction with little factual basis Trump received Three PinocchiosOn May 9 2017 Trump fired James_B Comey as FBI_director As a justification Trump and Attorney_General Jeff_Sessions pointed to Comeys handling of the agencys investigation_into Hillary_Clintons private email server But during the 2016_presidential campaigns neither Trump nor Sessions was outwardly critical of Comeys decisions at_least in the same way they were in May 2017 In this column we explored inconsistencies in both mens rhetoric over Comeys handling of the Clinton investigationOver the three days after Comeys firing the exact reason for his dismissal remained elusive In this column we outlined all the contradictory explanations from Trump and his White_House At first Trump said he was merely acting on a Justice_Department recommendation Several explanations later Trump ultimately revealedthat he had planned on firing Comey all along because Trump did_not want Comey overseeing the FBI investigation_into Russian_meddling in the 2016 electionOn May 15 The_Post reported that Trump revealed highly classified information to the Russian foreign_minister and ambassador in a White_House meeting and that Trumps disclosures jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic_State In response national_security adviser HR McMaster made comments that obscured the fact that he essentially confirmed the key factual elements of The_Post article In this column we translated McMasters rhetoricBy the end of May it was clear that the story of Flynn merged with the firing of Comey So we compiled a new timeline of events incorporating both story lines showing the complicated relationship between Trump and ComeyOn June 8 Comey testified to the Senate_Intelligence Committee and offered his version of events for the first time The testimony revealed several contradictory statements made by Trump and Comey about the same meetings and discussions We also compiled a Fact_Checker video timeline of the he-said he-said storyNo matter what new development is revealed in the Trump-Russia story one thing has remained consistent Trump blames the Democrats not the Russians Trump calls it a hoax witch_hunt and fake_news despite findings by the US intelligence_community and even after the White_House confirmed reports of his teams interactions with RussiansAfter Comey was fired former FBI_director Robert_S Mueller_III was appointed special_counsel to oversee the Russia investigation and related matters As Mueller assembled his team of investigators Trump and his surrogates began attacking donations made by some of Muellers attorneys They questioned Muellers independence as some members of his team previously donated to Hillary_Clinton Barack_Obama or the Democratic_Party But this is a baseless attack legally and under federal ethics rules such donations pose no conflict of interest Trump earned Three PinocchiosIn June Mueller widened the scope of his investigation including whether Trump obstructed justice when firing Comey As a result with every new development Trumps critics are quick to call for his impeachment and label his actions as obstruction of justice But its not so simple and the complexities of the process get muddled with heated rhetoric In this column we answered some key questions about obstruction of justice impeachment and executive privilegeOn July 8 2017 the New_York Times revealed that Donald Trump Jr met with a Russian attorney with ties to the Kremlin during the 2016 campaign In following days Trump Jr provided contradictory and misleading statements that shifted as the Times uncovered new information about the meeting While Trump Jr previously claimed that he never set_up a meeting with a Russian national for campaign purposes that turned out to be falseIn response to questions about the Trump campaigns contacts with Russia the White_House began deflecting to efforts by a Ukrainian American operative to expose former Trump campaign_chairman Paul Manaforts ties to the Russian_government The White_House now claims that the real story of coordination is between the Clinton campaign and Ukraine But this is a facile comparison with key differences between the situations that make them fundamentally different We left the claim unrated for now because we do not know the full set of facts in either the Trump-Russia or Clinton-Ukraine storiesWhite House Press Secretary Sarah_Huckabee Sanders asserted that Fusion_GPS a research firm run by ex-journalists took money from the Russian_government while it arranged for the creation of a dossier about Trumps ties to RussiaBut she is mixing up two unrelated clients of the firm There were Russian entities involved but there is currently no_evidence that the Russian_government paid for Fusions work on the defense of a Russian bank accused of fraud at the same_time Fusion investigated Trumps business_dealings in Russia Huckabee earned Three Pinocchios for spin that fell flat()FBI agents raided the home in Alexandria Va of President Trumps former campaign_chairman arriving in the pre-dawn hours late last_month andseizing documents and other materials related to the special_counsel investigation of Russian_meddling in the 2016 electionThe raid which occurred without warning on July26 signaled an aggressive new approach by special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III and his team in dealing with a key figure in the Russia inquiry Manafort has been under increasing pressure as the Mueller team looked into his personal finances and his professional career as a highly paid foreign political consultantUsing a search_warrant agents appeared the day Manafort was scheduled to testify before the Senate_Judiciary Committee and a day after he met voluntarily with Senate_Intelligence Committee staff membersThe search_warrant requested documents related to tax banking and other matters People familiar with the search said agents departed the Manafort residence with a trove of material including binders prepared ahead of Manaforts congressional testimonyInvestigators in the Russia inquiry have previously sought documents with subpoenas which are less intrusive and confrontational than a search_warrant With a warrant agents can inspect a physical location and seize any useful information To get a judge to sign off on a search_warrant prosecutors must show that there is probable_cause that a crime has been committed I_think it adds a shock and awe enforcement component to what until now has followed a natural path for a white-collar investigation said Jacob Frenkel a former federal_prosecutor More so than anything else weve seen so_far it really does send a powerful law_enforcement message when the search_warrant is used That message is that the special_counsel team will use all criminal investigative tools available to advance the investigation as quickly and as comprehensively as possibleJason Maloni a spokesman for Manafort confirmed that agents executed a warrant at one of the political consultants homes and that Manafort cooperated with the searchManafort has been voluntarily providing documents to congressional_committees investigating Russias election interference The search_warrant indicates that investigators may have argued to a federal_judge that they had reason to think Manafort could not be trusted to turn over all records in response to a grand_jury subpoenaThe raid also could have been intended to send a message to Trumps former campaign_chairman that he should not expect gentle treatment or legal courtesies from Muellers_team members who already have begun combing through Manaforts complicated financial past The documents seizedin the raid include materials Manafort already had provided to Congress said people_familiar with the search and the significance of what was obtained remained unclear Wednesday eveningIf the FBI wanted the documents they could just ask [Manafort] and he would have turned them over said one adviser close to the White HouseJosh Stueve spokesman for Mueller declined to comment as did Reginald Brown an attorney for Manafort Mr Manafort has consistently cooperated with law_enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well said Maloni the Manafort spokesmanSen Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn) a member of the Judiciary_Committee and a former US attorney called the search a significant and even stunning development noting that such raids are generally reserved for the most serious criminal investigations dealing with uncooperative or untrusted potential targetsA federal_judge signing this warrant would demand persuasive evidence of probable_cause that a serious crime has been committed and that less intrusive and dramatic investigative means would be ineffective he said in a statement Mueller has increased legal pressure on Manafort consolidating under his authority unrelated investigations of various aspects of Manaforts professional and personal lifeManaforts allies fear that Mueller hopes to build a case against Manafort unrelated to the 2016 campaign in hopes that he would provide information against others in Trumps inner circle in exchange for lessening his legal exposureManafort has provided more_than 300 pages ofdocuments to the Senate_Judiciary Committee and

that Trump Jr accepted the meeting and invited Manafort after he was told that the Russian lawyer would provide damaging_information about Democrat Hillary_Clinton as part of a Russian_government effort to assist his fathers campaignThe special_counsels office has subpoenaed records and testimony related to the Trump_Tower meeting people_familiar with the investigation saidLast week the Trump campaign turned over more_than 20000 pages of documents to congressional investigators examining Russian efforts to influence the election Manafort and Trump Jr separately turned over hundreds of documents requested by congressional committeesManafort had been subpoenaed to appear before the Senate_Judiciary Committee on July 26 the day of the raid Ultimately however the subpoena was withdrawn and he did_not testify Thecommittee chairman Sen Charles E Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen Dianne Feinstein (Calif) the panels ranking_Democrat said in a joint statement that they had dropped the demand after Manafort began producing documents Manafort an experienced political operative who was oncea business_partner of Trump confidant Roger Stonewas hired to professionalize the Trump campaign at the recommendationof another Trump friend Tom Barrack an international real_estate investorAs a political consultant Manafort traveled the world at times offering advice to despots and dictatorsHis decade of work in Ukraine on behalf of a Russia-friendly political party has drawn attention from the FBI In Kiev he advised the Party of Regions helping to elect former president Viktor_Yanukovych who was ousted from power amid public protests in 2014 and fled to RussiaA few days after attending the Trump_Tower meeting in June_2016 at the urging of Trump Jr Manafort was named chairman of Trumps campaign following the ouster of campaign_manager Corey_Lewandowski Manafort remained in that role through the Republican National_Convention and into August when he resigned amid growing scrutiny of his work in Ukraine The New_York Times reported at the time that his name was found in a ledger of off-the-books cash payments made by the Party of Regions Manafort has denied receiving any improper payments from the partyStill the work was lucrative In June Manafort filed Foreign_Agents Registration_Act paperwork with the Justice_Department providing new details about his work in Ukraine The documents showed that his firm was paid $171million for its work in Ukraine over two years before expensesManaforts retroactive filing about his Ukraine work came as investigators scrutinized his foreign lobbying and began to aggressively probe his financial pastDuring the spring prosecutors issued subpoenas seeking information about his income sources and financial transactions One subpoena reviewed by The Washington_Post sought information concerning contracts for work communication or other records of correspondence related to about two dozen people and businesses that appeared to be connected to Manafort or his wife including some who worked for Manafort while he was a political consultant in UkraineThe subpoena was issued by a federal grand_jury in the Eastern District of Virginia where Manaforts consulting business has been located Also named in the subpoena were various corporations formed in Cyprus Manafort appeared to have routed money he earned in Ukraine and in business_dealings with a Russian business magnate through Cyprus-based bank accountsAfter Mueller was appointed his team took over the Manafort investigation that was underway in VirginiaState authorities in New_York also have issued subpoenas seeking information about Manaforts real_estate loansAnd Muellers office has taken over an investigation of financial dealings that involved Manafort and his son-in-law a real_estate investor including real_estate transactions in California Philip Rucker Matt Zapotosky and Julie Tate contributed to this reportThe FBI obtained a secret court order last_summer to monitor the communications of an adviser to presidential_candidate Donald Trump part of an investigation_into possible links_between Russia and the campaign law_enforcement and other US officials said The FBI and the Justice_Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Pages communications after convincing a Foreign_Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable_cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power in this case Russia according to the officials This is the clearest evidence so_far that the FBI had reason to believe during the 2016_presidential campaign that a Trump campaign adviser was in touch with Russian agents Such contacts are now at the center of an investigation_into whether the campaign coordinated with the Russian_government to swing the election Page has not been accused of any crimes and it is unclear_whether the Justice_Department might later seek charges_against him or others in connection with Russias meddling in the 2016_presidential electioninvestigations dont result in criminal chargesThe officials spoke about the court order on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of a counterintelligence probeDuring an interview with the Washington_Post editorial page staff in March_2016 who had previously been an investment banker in Moscow as a foreign_policy adviser to his campaign Campaign spokeswoman Pages role as informalPage has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in his dealings with the Trump campaign or Russia This confirms all of my suspicions about unjustified politically motivated government surveillance Page said in an interview Tuesday I have nothing to hide He compared surveillance of him to the eavesdropping that the FBI and Justice_Department conducted against civil_rights leader Martin Luther King Jr The White_House FBI and Justice_Department declined to commentFBI Director_James B_Comey disclosed in public testimony to the House_Intelligence Committee last_month that the bureau is investigating efforts by the Russian_government to interfere in the 2016_presidential election Comey said this includes investigating the nature of any links_between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian_government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russias effortsComey declined to comment during the hearing about any individuals including Page who worked in Moscow for Merrill Lynch a decade ago and who has said he invested in Russian energy giant Gazprom In a letter to Comey in September Page had said he had sold his Gazprom investmentDuring the hearing last_month Democratic lawmakers repeatedly singled out Pages contacts in Russia as a cause for concern The judges who rule on Foreign_Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requests oversee the nations most sensitive national_security cases and their warrants are some of the most closely guarded secrets in the world of US law_enforcement and intelligence gathering Any FISA application has to be approved at the highest levels of the Justice_Department and the FBIApplications for FISA warrants Comey said are often thicker than his wrists and that thickness represents all the work Justice_Department attorneys and FBI agents have to do to convince a judge that such surveillance is appropriate in an investigation The governments application for the surveillance order targeting Page included a lengthy declaration that laid out investigators basis for believing that Page was an agent of the Russian_government and knowingly engaged in clandestine intelligence activities on behalf of Moscow officials said Among other things the application cited contacts that he had with a Russian intelligence operative in New_York City in 2013 officials said Those contacts had earlier surfaced in a federal espionage case brought by the Justice_Department against the intelligence operative and two other Russian agents In_addition the application said Page had other contacts with Russian operatives that have not been publicly disclosed officials said An application for electronic surveillance under the Foreign_Intelligence Surveillance Act need not show evidence of a crime But the information obtained through the intercepts can be used to open a criminal investigation and may be used in a prosecutionThe application also showed that the FBI and the Justice Departments national_security division have been seeking since July to determine how broad a network of accomplices Russia enlisted in attempting to influence the 2016_presidential election the officials saidSince the 90-day warrant was first issued it has been renewed more_than once by the FISA court the officials said In February Page told PBS NewsHour that he was a junior member of the [Trump] campaigns foreign_policy advisory groupA former Trump campaign adviser said Page submitted policy memos to the campaign and several times asked to be given a meeting with Trump though his request was never granted He was one of the more active ones in terms of being in touch the adviser saidThe campaign adviser said Page participated in three dinners held for the campaigns volunteer foreign_policy advisers in the spring and summer of 2016 coming from New_York to Washington to meet with the group Although Trump did_not attend Sen_Jeff Sessions (R-Ala) a top Trump confidant who became his attorney_general attended one meeting of the group with Page in late summer the campaign adviser said Pages role as an adviser to the Trump campaign drew alarm last_year from more-established foreign_policy experts in part because of Pages effusive praise for Russian President_Vladimir Putin and his criticism of US sanctions over Moscows military intervention in Ukraine In July Page traveled to Moscow where he delivered a speech harshly critical of the United_States policy toward Russia While there Page allegedly met with Igor Sechin a Putin confidant and chief_executive of the energy company Rosneft according to a dossier compiled by a former_British intelligence_officer and cited at a congressional hearing by Rep Adam B Schiff (Calif) the ranking_Democrat on the House_Intelligence Committee Officials said some of the information in the dossier has been verified by US intelligence_agencies and some of it hasnt while other parts are unlikely to ever be proved or disprovedOn Tuesday Page dismissed what he called the dodgy dossier of false allegationsPage has denied such a meeting occurred saying he has never met Sechin in his life and that he wants to testify before Congress to clear his name A spokesman for Rosneft told Politico in September that the notion that Page met with Sechin was absurd Page said in September that he briefly met Russian Deputy Prime_Minister Arkady Dvorkovich during that trip Comey has declined to discuss the details of the Russia probe but in an appearance last_month he cited the process for getting FISA warrants as proof that the governments surveillance powers are very carefully used with significant oversightIt is a pain in the neck to get permission to conduct electronic surveillance in the United_States And thats good he told an audience at the University of Texas in Austin Officials have said the FBI and the Justice_Department were particularly reluctant to seek FISA warrants of campaign figures during the 2016_presidential race because of concerns that agents would inadvertently eavesdrop on political talk To obtain a FISA warrant prosecutors must show that a significant purpose of the warrant is to obtain foreign intelligence information Page is the only American to have had his communications directly targeted with a FISA warrant in 2016 as part of the Russia probe officials said The FBI routinely obtains FISA warrants to monitor the communications of foreign diplomats in the United_States including the Russian_ambassador The conversations between Kislyak and Michael_Flynn who became Trumps first national_security adviser were recorded in December In February The Washington_Post reported that Flynn misled Vice President-elect Mike_Pence and others about his discussions with Kislyak prompting Trumps decision to fire himIn March Trump made unsubstantiated claims about US surveillance of Trump_Tower in New_York Later that month Rep Devin_Nunes (R-Calif) chairman of the House_Intelligence Committee and a Trump transition official charged that details about people associated with the incoming administration details with little apparent foreign intelligence value were widely disseminated in intelligence_community reporting He said none of the surveillance was related to Russia The FISA order on Page is unrelated to either chargeLast month the former director of national intelligence James R Clapper Jr told NBCs Meet the Press that US law_enforcement agencies did_not have any FISA orders to monitor the communications of Trump either as a candidate or as a president-elect or his campaign But Clapper did_not address whether there were any FISA warrants targeting Trump associates Three years before Page became an adviser to the Trump campaign he came to the attention of FBI counterintelligence agents who learned that Russian spy suspects had sought to use Page as a source for information In that case one of the Russian suspects Victor Podobnyy who was posing as a diplomat and was later charged by federal_prosecutors with acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government was captured on tape in 2013 discussing an effort to get information and documents from Page That discussion was detailed in a federal complaint filed against Podobnyy and two others The court_documents in that spy case only identify Page as Male 1 Officials familiar with the case said that Male 1 is PageIn one secretly recorded conversation detailed in the complaint Podobnyy said Page wrote that he is sorry he went to Moscow and forgot to check his inbox but he wants to meet when he gets back I_think he is an idiot and forgot who I am Plus he writes to me in Russian [to] practice the language He flies to Moscow more often than I do He got hooked on Gazprom thinking that if they have a project he could rise up Maybe he can I dont_know but its obvious that he wants to earn lots of moneyThe same court document says that in June 2013 Page told FBI agents that he met Podobnyy at an energy symposium in New_York where they exchanged contact information In subsequent meetings Page shared with the Russian his outlook on the state of the energy industry as well as documents about the energy business according to the court papersIn the secret tape Podobnyy said he liked the mans enthusiasm but planned to use him to get information and give him little in return You promise a favor for a favor You get the documents from him and tell him to go f--- himself Podobnyy said on the tape according to court papersPage has said the information he provided to the Russians in 2013 was innocuous describing it as basic immaterial information and publicly available research documents He said he had assisted the prosecutors in their case against Evgeny Buryakov who pleaded_guilty to conspiring to act in the United_States as an unregistered agent of Russian intelligence Rosalind S Helderman contributed to this reportThe former_British spy who authored a controversial dossier on behalf of Donald Trumps political opponents alleging ties between Trump and Russia reached an agreement with the FBI a few weeks before the election for the bureau to pay him to continue his work according to several people_familiar with the arrangementThe agreement to compensate former MI6 agent Christopher_Steele came as US intelligence_agencies reached a consensus that the Russians had interfered in the presidential_election by orchestrating hacks of Democratic_Party email accountsWhile Trump has derided the dossier as fake_news compiled by his political opponents the FBIs arrangement with Steele shows that the bureau considered him credible and found his information while unproved to be worthy of further investigationUltimately the FBI did_not pay Steele Communications between the bureau and the former spy were interrupted as Steeles now-famous dossier became the subject of news stories congressional inquiries and presidential denials according to the people_familiar with the arrangement who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matterAt the time of the October agreement FBI officials probing Russian activities including possible contacts between Trump associates and Russian entities were aware of the information that Steele had been gathering while working for a Washington research firm hired by supporters of Democratic nominee Hillary_Clinton according to the people_familiar with the agreement The firm was due to stop paying Steele as Election_Day approached but Steele felt his work was not done these people said Steele was familiar to the FBI in part because the bureau had previously hired him to help a US inquiry into alleged corruption in the The FBI sometimes pays informants sources and outside investigators to assist in its work Steele was known for the quality of his past work and for the knowledge he had developed over nearly 20 years working on Russia-related issues for British_intelligence The Washington_Post was not able to determine how_much the FBI intended to pay Steele had their relationship remained intactThe dossier he produced last_year alleged among other things that associates of Trump colluded with the Kremlin on cyberattacks on Democrats and that the Russians held compromising material about the Republican nomineeThese and other explosive claims have not been verified and they have been by Trump and his alliesThe FBI as well as the Senate_Intelligence Committee is investigating Russian_interference in the election and alleged contacts between Trumps associates and the KremlinOn Tuesday House Speaker Paul D Ryan (R-Wis) told_reporters that he had seen no_evidence so_far of Trump campaign contacts with Russia but said a bipartisan House inquiry would proceed so that no stone is unturnedThe revelation that the FBI agreed to pay Steele at the same_time he was being paid by Clinton supporters to dig into Trumps background could further strain relations between the law_enforcement agency and the White HouseA spokesman for the FBI declined to comment Steeles London-based attorney did_not respond to questions about the agreementWhite House_press secretary_Sean Spicer declined to

reports alleged a plan directed by Russian President_Vladimir Putin to help Trump in 2016Russian regime has been cultivating supporting and assisting TRUMP for at_least 5 years Steele wrote in JuneSteeles information was provided by an intermediary to the FBI and US intelligence officials after the Democratic_National Convention in July when were first released by WikiLeaks according to a source familiar with the events After the convention Steele contacted a friend in the FBI to personally explain what he had foundAs summer turned to fall Steele became concerned that the US government was not taking the information he had uncovered seriously enough according to two people_familiar with the situationIn October anticipating that funding supplied through the original client would dry up Steele and the FBI reached a spoken understanding He would continue his work looking at the Kremlins ties to Trump and receive compensation for his effortsBut Steeles frustration deepened when FBI Director_James B_Comey who had been silent on the Russia inquiry publicly 11_days before the election that the bureau was investigating a newly discovered cache of emails Clinton had exchanged using her private server according to people_familiar with Steeles thinkingThose people say Steeles frustration with the FBI peaked after an Oct 31 New_York Times story that cited law_enforcement sources drawing conclusions that he considered premature The said that the FBI had not yet found any conclusive or direct link between Trump and the Russian_government and that the Russian hacking was not intended to help TrumpAfter the election the intelligence_community concluded that Russias interference had been intended to assist TrumpIn January top intelligence and law_enforcement officials briefed Trump and President_Barack Obama on those findings In_addition they provided a summary of the core allegations of Steeles dossier News of that briefing soon became public Then BuzzFeed posted a copy of Steeles salacious but unproven dossier online sparking outrage from TrumpIts all fake_news Its phony stuff It didnt happen Trump in January It was a group of opponents that got together sick people and they put that crap togetherHe later tweeted that Steele was a failed spyThe development marked the end of the FBIs relationship with SteeleAfter he was publicly identified by the Wall_Street Journal as the dossiers author Steele US officials took pains to stress that his report was not a US government product and that it had not influenced their broader conclusions that the Russian_government had hacked the emails of Democratic officials and released those emails with the intention of helping Trump win the presidencyThe [intelligence community] has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable and we did_not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions then-Director of National Intelligence James R Clapper Jr said in in JanuaryThe owner of a technology company identified in Steeles dossier as a participant in the hacks is now suing Steele and BuzzFeed for defamation BuzzFeed apologized to the executive and blocked out his name in the published documentComey spent almost two hours this month briefing the Senate_Intelligence Committee Democrats in the House have informally reached out to Steele in recent_weeks to ask about his willingness to testify or cooperate according to people_familiar with the requests Steele has so_far not responded they saidA federal_judge in Washington blocked the Trump Administrations proposed transgender military ban writing in a strongly worded opinion that the policy does_not appear to be supported by any factsUS District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly issued the preliminary injunction Monday finding that a group of transgender service_members would have a strong chance of prevailing in their lawsuit to have the ban declared unconstitutional The injunction remains in place until the lawsuit is resolved or a judge lifts itThe move is another legal setback for the president who surprised military leaders and members of Congress when he announced the proposal in late July that reversed an Obama_administration policy allowing transgender service_members to serve openly and begin enlisting in JanuaryThe tweets were followed by a presidential directive and a plan set to take effect in March that would have blocked military recruitment of transgender people and would have of current transgender service membersThe judges injunction effectively reverts Trumps policy to the one issued under ObamaThe Obama_administration announced its policy after a Pentagon review found no basis to exclude transgender people from the military after it examined medical care military readiness and other factorsThe Monday ruling was hailed by GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders (GLAD) and the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) who sued in August on behalf of six active-duty transgender service_members who had come out to their superiors and had roughly 60years combined in the military It was the first of to challenge the ban and the first significant ruling by a judge on Trumps policyThis is a complete victory for our plaintiffs and all transgender service_members who are now once again able to serve on equal terms and without the threat of being discharged said NCLR Legal Director Shannon MinterDepartment of Justice spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam issued a statement saying the department is currently evaluating the next steps Department attorneys had previously asked for the suit to be dismissedPlaintiffs lawsuit challenging military service requirements is premature for many reasons including that the Defense Department is actively reviewing such service requirements as the President ordered and because none of the Plaintiffs have established that they will be impacted by current policies on military service the statement read The six service_members in the lawsuit contended that their Fifth Amendment rights to equal protection were being violated a claim bolstered by three former Obama_administration service branch chiefs and a senior Pentagon official who offered statements saying the ban would harm readiness staffing recruitment and moraleKollar-Kotelly was unsparing in her ruling saying the hastily announced Trump policy did_not pass muster on many frontsThere is absolutely no support for the claim that the ongoing service of transgender people would have any negative effect on the military at all In fact there is considerable evidence that it is the discharge and banning of such individuals that would have such effects Kollar-Kotelly wroteCarl Tobias a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law said the Trump administration would likely have to go all the way to the Supreme_Court to have any chance of getting the preliminary injunction nullifiedIf they go to the DC Circuit I cant imagine they are going to overturn this Tobias said The judge was strong in her opinion She just didnt see any support for the policy on the factsMore than a dozen states filed a brief in October supporting the arguments of the service_members in the case writing that Trump was pursuing an irrational return to discrimination in the military One aspect of the opinion that continued to be debated Monday was the barring of military funding for sex-reassignment surgery which is part of the banKollar-Kotellys order found that none of the plaintiffs had shown they were likely to be affected by that funding ban so the court was not in a position to rule on the propriety of this directiveTransgender advocates however insisted that the ruling allowed the military to continue to pay for such surgeries The Department of Justice declined to comment on its understanding of the ruling as it relates to the surgery issueThere is no official tally of transgender military members and estimates vary widely One recent study by the Rand Corp put the number on active duty at about 2500 while another from the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law estimated that there were 15500 on active duty in the National Guard and in the reserves Currently allow transgender troops to serve in the militaryTrumps proposal was cheered by many religious conservatives but outraged transgender advocates and many liberals Trump blindsided many when he announced the policy on TwitterAfter consultation with my Generals and military experts please be advised that the United_States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the US Military Trump wrote in the tweets Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entailLesbian gay and transgender advocates say the ban is part of a broader pattern of discrimination by the Trump administration This month Attorney_General Jeff_Sessions reversed a Justice_Department policy protecting transgender workers from discrimination under federal lawPresident Trump on Tuesday belittled former foreign_policy adviser_George Papadopoulos who pleaded_guilty this week to lying to federal agents investigating Russias interference in the 2016 election tweeting that few people knew the young low_level volunteer named George who has already proven to be a liarBut interviews and documents_show that Papadopoulos was in regular contact with the Trump campaigns most senior officials and held himself out as a Trump surrogate as he traveled the world to meet with foreign officials and reportersPapadopoulos sat at the elbow of one of Trumps top campaign advisers then-Sen Jeff_Sessions during a dinner for campaign advisers weeks before the Republican National_Convention according to an individual who attended the meeting He met in London in September 2016 with a mid-level representative of the British Foreign Office where he said he had contacts at the senior level of the Russian_government And he conferred at one point with the foreign_minister of Greece at a meeting in New YorkWhile some top campaign aides appeared to rebuff there is no sign they told him directly to cease his activities or sought to end his affiliation with the campaignEmails included in court_documents released Monday show that Papadopoulos repeatedly told Trump campaign officials about his contacts with people he believed were representing the Russian governmentThe court_documents do not answer a key question whether Papadopoulos also told his superiors that he had met a London-based professor who claimed to know that the Russians had dirt on Democratic candidate Hillary_Clinton including thousands of her emailsAn FBI agent told the court in July that Papadopoulos lied in an interview with federal agents saying he did_not tell anyone on the campaign about the dirt because he thought the professor was a nothing At 29 Papadopoulos had scant experience that qualified him to advise a presidential_candidate He had entered the Trump campaign after a six-week stint working for the campaign of Trumps rival for the Republican nomination neurosurgeon Ben CarsonCarsons campaign_manager Barry Bennett recalled that Papadopoulos was hired after sending him an unsolicited message via LinkedIn seeking a jobAt the time Carsons campaign was desperate to show it had policy experts advising his campaign given that most leading Republican foreign_policy thinkers had been snapped up by other candidatesBennett said his only vetting was to ask a friend at the Washington-based Hudson Institute where Papadopouloss rsum indicated he had worked as a researcher whether Papadopoulos was an okay guyI wasnt looking for something stellar Bennett said I wanted to make_sure he was okayFor six weeks of work Bennett said Papadopoulos was paid $8500 before he was let go from the campaign at the end of January 2016 as it shed staffBy March_2016 Trumps campaign like Carsons before it was eagerly searching for foreign_policy expertise As Trump rose in the polls and won Republican primaries the former reality TV host was under pressure to announce a group of advisers with whom he was consulting on foreign_policy issuesThe scrutiny intensified early that month after 70 conservative national_security experts signed an open letter opposing Trumps candidacy In mid-March Trump was asked on the MSNBC show Morning Joe to name people with whom he spoke about foreign affairs Im speaking with myself number one because I have a very good brain Trump responded prompting more calls for a list of formal advisersTo come up with names the campaign turned to Sam_Clovis a former Iowa radio_host who served_as national campaign co-chairman an attorney for Clovis confirmed Tuesday in a statementBut the statement did_not address how Papadopoulos ended up on the list Bennett said he was not consulted and would not have recommended his former employee if he had been asked because he found him unimpressiveOn March 21 Trump included Papadopoulos among five men he announced were advising him on matters of national_security in a meeting with The Washington_Post editorial board An energy and oil consultant Excellent guy Trump said If Trump or his team had undertaken even a cursory vetting of Papadopoulos they would have found that much of his already-slim rsum was either exaggerated or falseWhile he claimed to have served for several years as a fellow at the Hudson Institute officials there said he had been an unpaid intern and a researcher under contract to several fellows who were writing a bookAlthough he claimed to be US Representative at the 2012 Geneva International Model United_Nations officials at that organization said they had no record of him Papadopoulos said he had delivered the keynote address at a leading American-Greek organization in 2008 while a student at DePaul University But records from the gathering indicate he merely participated in a youth panel with other participants The keynote was delivered by 1988 Democratic presidential_candidate Michael DukakisThough Papadopouloss exaggerated rsum issues quickly became public he remained a part of the Trump advisory panel and soon began urging campaign aides to let him set_up a meeting between Trump and Russian officialsCourt documents_show he raised the idea at a March 31 meeting of the group attended by both Trump and Sessions who had endorsed Trumps campaign telling the group that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President [Vladimir] PutinHe also began appearing in the foreign press While visiting Israel the next month he told a group of researchers that Trump saw Putin as a responsible actor and potential partner according to a column in the Jerusalem PostIn May he told the Telegraph of London that Prime_Minister David Cameron should apologize to Trump for calling the candidate divisive stupid and wrong Camerons comments had come after Trump announced that he supported a ban on Muslims entering the United StatesPapadopouloss comments were big news in Britain and the campaign took notice JD Gordon a former Pentagon spokesman and Trump national_security adviser said campaign officials were displeased and Papadopoulos was counseled that he should clear future media appearances with campaign staff and keep a low profileI was surprised to learn what George_Papadopoulos was up to during the campaign he said Tuesday in a text message He obviously went to great lengths to go around me and Sen SessionsAnd yet Papadopoulos continued to be invited to campaign events In late June or early July he attended a dinner at the Capitol_Hill Club along with several other national_security advisers for the Trump campaign Another person who was at the meeting said Sessions also attended Papadopoulos was seated to Sessionss leftA spokeswoman for Sessions declined to commentMedia appearances by Papadopoulos continued In September he spoke extensively to Interfax telling the Russian news_agency that Trump has been open about his willingness to usher in a new chapter in US-Russia relations depending on Russia acting as a responsible stake holder in the international system He also questioned the effectiveness of US sanctions on RussiaBy that time WikiLeaks had released emails hacked from the Democratic_National Committee that were widely suspected to have been stolen at the direction of the Russian_government Trumps warm rhetoric toward Putin had become a controversial topic on the campaign trailCourt documents_show that Papadopoulos forwarded a copy of the Interfax article to a Russian woman with whom he had been corresponding during the campaign British sources said it was around that time that he approached British government officials to say he was traveling to London and asked to be given a meeting with senior government ministers Instead he was offered a session with a mid-level official at the Foreign Office in LondonDuring the meeting Papadopoulos made a comment indicating he had contacts at the senior level of the Russian_government British sources said British officials quickly concluded he was not a major or knowledgeable player in the Trump orbit and did_not pursue the issue or continue contactA spokesman for the Greek Embassy said he met with that nations foreign_minister in New_York Spokesman Efthymios Aravantinos said the conversation was conducted as part of a routine effort that the embassy makes to reach out to Greek Americans hoping they have a sentimental attachment to Greece and that we can connectIt is not clear how_much the campaign knew about Papadopouloss activities But he continued through these months to have contact with other Trump officialsIn September Papadopoulos_emailed another Trump aide Boris Epshteyn and told him he planned to be in New_York and hoped to set_up meetings around the UN General Assembly meetingThe email was in August of this year and is among 20000 pages of documents that the Trump campaign has turned over to the White_House Congressional committees and defense attorneysPapadopoulos wrote that he wanted to connect Epshteyn with a friend Sergei Millian of the Russian American_Chamber of Commerce the emails saidMillian would later be identified as a major source for the author of a dossier that included unsubstantiated salacious allegations about Trumps activities in Russia a claim Millian has denied Epshteyn said he never met Millian and declined to comment further Asked in August to describe his relationship with Papadopoulos Millian responded by email I can meet and talk to any person Its none of your businessMillian did_not respond to a request for comment TuesdayPapadopoulos continued to hold himself out as a Trump adviser even after the November election Two days after Trumps inauguration in January he met in Washington with a group of Israelis headed by Yossi Dagan a leader of the West Bank settler movement that prepared a video of the session to be shown at homeWe had an excellent meeting with Yossi and we hope that the people of Judea and Samaria the name used by the Israeli right for the West Bank will have a great 2017 Papadopoulos said according to the video We are looking forward to ushering in a new relationship with all of IsraelAccording to an account in the Jerusalem Post the settler leaders had been invited to attend the inauguration and meet with senators congressmen and members of the Presidents team Dagan reached by telephone Tuesday in Israel declined to comment on the visit or who had arranged the meeting with Papadopoulos While the president now seems to have left Papadopoulos behind Papadopoulos has continued to highlight the tie On LinkedIn he indicates he was a Trump adviser through January

Sari Horwitz and Devlin Barrett in Washington and Ruth Eglash in Jerusalem contributed to this reportOn Sunday morning President Trump expressed frustration that his campaign is under investigation

that work was for other legal matters and how_much of it related to Fusion_GPS Its unclear how Trump arrived at the $12 million figure used in his tweets When it comes to the Uranium to Russia deal

store Gillespie said [Rubios] parents worked on their feet all day long His mother was a hotel maid His father was a bartender He too is the son of immigrantsWe appreciate and understand the importance of the American Dream because our parents have seen it here firsthand he saidThen he introduced Rubio but just before the senator took the stage an activist jumped up on the stage holding a sign protesting deportations Sheriffs deputies quickly hustled her out of the building as the audience clappedWithin minutes Rubio alluded to the immigration controversy telling the crowd that Gillespie would work for them no matter where your family came from or how your last name is pronouncedRubio said he too comes from a community affected by gang violence and said it would make no sense to ignore MS-13 in a state impacted by the gangThat would be like talking_about organized crime but refusing to talk about the Mafia he said to chuckles from supportersLater he joked about his

said Gillespie is trying to win the election based on racism and fearHe is using racist imagery and language to send his message she said When he shows images of Latino-looking people and says Fear

on CNN ManafortMSNBC ManafortFox News Hamburger emoji Roberto Ferdman (@robferdman)For three hours Saturday Rep Darrell Issa (R-Calif) endured pointed questions jeers and derisive laughter during two successive town halls in this northern suburb of San DiegoBut this wasnt just a moment for Issa to let anxious constituents vent their worries about immigration policy health-care reform or the first seven weeks of President Trumps tenure It was a major first test of the Democratic Partys efforts to turn antipathy toward Trump into electoral gains in 2018 It was also a chance for Issa to show that he is willing to stand apart from Trump for a district that has rapidly grown more liberal in recent yearsI do not work for the executive branch Issa said in an opening statement Saturday at one of two morning town hall meetings at a community center here I investigated the Obama_administration I also investigated the Bush administrationIssa 63 has been distancing himself from Trump for some time Widely seen as a partisan flamethrower during his years leading the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and its many investigations of the Obama_administration Issa is more likely these days to defend the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency or to demand a rigorous investigation_into allegations of Russian intervention in the 2016 electionHe has good reason to moderate Californias 49th Congressional District which encompasses the increasingly diverse and liberal suburban cities in northern San Diego County and southern Orange County is no_longer the safely Republican terrain that it was for Issas first eight elections to CongressLast year Issa won narrowly against a lawyer and retired Marine colonel Douglas Applegate who has announced plans to challenge him again in 2018 Last week environmental lawyer Mike Levin another Democrat announced that he too plans to challenge IssaOn Saturday one questioner noted that some Democrats have wondered whether Trump is too emotionally unstable to be trusted with nuclear weaponsIssas answer stopped short of a full-throated show of support for the new commander in chief If the issue comes up in front of the appropriate body he said I will vote my conscienceYet Issas attempts to distance himself from Trump were met with derision and boos When he referred to Russian President_Vladimir Putin as an evil son of a blank who sows chaos and then capitalizes on it an audience member yelled so does Trump The crowd cheeredA protester outside the community center held a sign that seemed to sum up the attitude of many if not most of the more_than 1000 who attended the two sessions Repeal and Replace the PresidentOne man wore a Russian military hat Another wore a T-shirt that read Trump-Putin 16 A woman held a sign Russia-Gate Follow the Money Another had a shirt signaling that she is a nasty woman a jibe Trump aimed_at Hillary_Clinton during a presidential campaign debateBetween the two sessions a reporter asked Issa whether he is worried about the 2018 congressional election becoming a referendum on TrumpI dont care he said Fact is that Im_going to be with Trump sometimes against him sometimesOnly a few of Issas colleagues held town hall meetings after Congresss workweek ended but questions about the American Health Care_Act as the House GOP plan to replace the Affordable_Care Act is known were rampant Rep Douglas A Collins (R-Ga) a supporter of the bill was confronted in a Friday night tele-town hall by a man named Bill who demanded that Republicans pass the repeal package of 2015 That has been the plan favored by Sen Rand Paul (R-Ky) and most of the conservative House Freedom Caucus Collins assured the constituent that the 2015 bill is in this package thats going to be sent to the president which is not true as the AHCA keeps some parts of the ACA that Republicans formerly voted to repealRep Ron DeSantis (R-Fla) a Freedom Caucus member whose district backed Trump by 17points told a morning crowd in St Augustine that he wasnt ready to back the billI dont_think you can come to grips with the bill in 36 hours I dont DeSantis said Im not sure it does enough to lower the costs of health careDeSantis was booed when he praised the idea of expanding health savings accounts a part of the GOPs plans he also said that a viral moment from a CNN interview he did where he appeared to be saying that cancer patients could get coverage at emergency rooms was misinterpreted He was received more sympathetically when he criticized the bill saying that as structured it might lead to higher premiumsIf you do it right people are going to have access to cheaper plans DeSantis said If you dont Im not sure its going to reduce costsIssa faced questions about the Affordable_Care Act too He did_not fully buy into the current GOP plan being promoted by House Speaker Paul D Ryan (R-Wis) But he didnt help himself with many in the crowd when he referred to the ACA as Obamacare which prompted the audience to boo and cry out the Affordable_Care ActIssa responded sharply Hey its not affordableAs at so many other town halls across the country in recent_weeks no one asked Issa about local issues not even about a recent deployment of Marines from nearby Camp Pendleton to Syria That suggests that the electorate is primed to turn the 2018 election into a referendum on Trump something of which Democrats are likely to try to take advantageAfter last years squeaker election in the 49th District Democrats listed Issa as among the most vulnerable Republican incumbents in 2018 The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has hired a full-time organizer in the district In response the GOP campaign committee has included Issa among 10 House incumbents who will receive additional help from the partyWhile most of the crowd Saturday was markedly anti-Trump a smattering of the presidents supporters were present some wearing the red Make America Great Again campaign hats A bare-chested man outside held a sign asking Whats Not To Like about Trumps viewsRepeatedly Issa asked questioners to be succinct and implored the rest of the audience to not drown out the question or answer His goal for the meeting was modest he joked with the crowdThe only thing I ask is that it not end like [the play] Hamilton he said referring to Alexander Hamiltons untimely death in a duel with Aaron Burr David Weigel in Fort Lauderdale Fla contributed to this reportWikiLeaks released yet_another batch of hacked emails from inside Hillary_Clintons campaign Wednesday and with them came another_round of embarrassing headlines and new glimpses of internal anxiety over the candidates weaknessesRepublican Donald Trump and his allies seized on the emails which reveal comments by an aide about Catholics a line from a paid speech in which Clinton might be seen as playing down the threat of terrorism and an internal dispute over potential conflicts of interest posed by the Clinton FoundationThe drip-drip-drip of damaging attention is likely to continue WikiLeaks the anti-secrecy organization began releasing new messages last Friday from the personal email account of Clintons campaign_chairman John_Podesta and has promised to issue tens of thousands moreThe correspondence reveals a campaign that has struggled all year to improve a flawed candidate As far back as March aides were keenly aware that she was resistant to the media perhaps out of touch with regular Americans and unable to convey a clear message to votersA month before Clinton launched her campaign her aides worked to corral her well-known love for granular policy details into a message that would both capture her agenda and present a forward-looking aspirational vision for her presidencyNearly a year later a similar struggle cropped up as they attempted to revise her core campaign messageDo we have any sense from her what she believes or wants her core message to be asked Clinton adviser Joel BenensonBenenson contrasted the simplicity of Bernie Sanderss anti-Wall Street message with Clintons multitiered campaign slogansSeven months later and on the cusp of Election_Day the concerns laid out in these emails and others largely remain Clinton has proven to be a lackluster candidate who has struggled to win over the liberals who gravitated to Sanders during the primary and who remains ahead in large part due to Trumps historic weaknessesRight now I am petrified that Hillary is almost totally dependent on Republicans nominating Trump Brent Budowsky a political columnist and former political adviser wrote in a March_2016 email to Podesta and Roy Spence an ad maker for the campaign She has huge endemic political weaknesses that she would be wise to rectifyEven a clown like Ted_Cruz would be an even money bet to beat and this scares the hell of out me Budowsky addedIndeed at_least one aide Benenson believed that Marco Rubio posed the greatest threat to Clinton if he were to become the Republican nomineeHovering over the trickle of embarrassing emails are suspicions both within the Clinton campaign and in intelligence circles that Russia is behind the hack The FBI is investigating the cyber incident as part of a broader inquiry into Russian hacking of political organizations such as the Democratic_National Committee law_enforcement officials said Clinton and her allies have linked the hacking to an attempt by the Russians to influence an American electionBy dribbling these out every day WikiLeaks is proving they are nothing but a propaganda arm of the Kremlin with a political agenda doing Putins dirty work to help elect Donald Trump said Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin The FBI is now investigating this crime The unanswered questions are why Donald Trump strangely wont condemn it and whether any of his associates are involvedRegardless the emails are likely to be a source of headaches for Clinton from now until Election_Day The Clinton campaign has declined to confirm the authenticity of the emails nor has it denied itAt a Wednesday afternoon rally in Lakeland Fla Trump called the WikiLeaks revelations big stuff and repeatedly slammed his Democratic rival over themThe Hillary_Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how_much is at stake on Nov 8 She would be the most dishonest and the most corrupt person ever elected to high office Trump told the crowdHis campaign held a conference call with reporters singling out an exchange showing campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri describing people who convert to CatholicismI imagine they think it is the most socially acceptable politically conservative religion their rich friends wouldnt understand if they became evangelicals Palmieri wrote according to WikiLeaks Palmieri who is Catholic said Wednesday aboard Clintons campaign plane that she has no recollection of the emailHouse Speaker Paul D Ryan (R-Wis) seized on the email in a statement denouncing the Clinton campaigns disdain for the Catholic faith although he cited a portion of the email not written by Palmieri or any other Clinton staffer The emails also show the campaigns internal struggle with how best to address the controversy surrounding the use of an email server while Clinton was at the State_Department and her resistance to her aides counsel about how best to but the issue asideIn March 2015 Nick Merrill now Clintons traveling press_secretary wrote to Palmieri suggesting that Clinton sit down with comedian and writer Larry Wilmore who was already scheduled to appear with Bill and Chelsea Clinton at a Clinton Global Initiative eventHRC is not slated to join but maybe she should Merrill wrote suggesting Wilmore could make a joke about hearing Hillary_Clinton is a big emailer As the email issue persisted top aide Huma Abedin asked Clintons advisers in May 2015 whether Clinton could survive not answering questions from press at events during the first leg of the campaign when she rolled out new policyIn the fall starting to do avails at message events interviews and Q and A with press but having had a series of policy proposals already announced and reported on that she could point to Abedin suggested seemingly to relay Clintons thinking to a number of top aidesPodesta disagreed in no uncertain termsIf she thinks we can get to Labor Day without taking press questions I_think thats suicidal Podesta wrote We have to find some mechanism to let the stream out of the pressure cookerA similar debate re-emerged in 2016 after Clinton went months without answering questions from her traveling press only to change course after Labor Day with more frequent news conferencesStill unable to lay the email issue to rest in 2015 Clintons aides talked about their effort to persuade Clinton to use the decision to turn over her server to the Justice_Department as an opportunity for her to be seen as having dealt with the issueIt is clear that she is not in same place (unless John has a convo with her and gets her in a different place) Palmieri wrote in August 2015To this day Clintons email server is a major part of Trumps case against her and is regularly cited by voters as among the reasons they dont trust herThe battle with Sanders also proved challenging Campaign aides sought to balance the need to reduce the damage his candidacy did to hers by bringing the primary to an end while also not alienating his liberal supporters whom she planned to rely in during the general electionIn the wake of Sanderss resounding defeat of Clinton in the New Hampshire primary the emails show top Clinton advisers discussing ways to slow the momentum of the senator from Vermont a self-described democratic socialistIn one email Clinton adviser Mandy Grunwald discusses several possible lines of attack including one under the header FREE STUFF FOR EVERYBODYCombined Sanders proposals would put the government in control of more_than half of the American economy but Sanders has never told anyone who would pay for all of this or how it would work she wroteOthers warned against attacking Sanders too hard and risking turning away his supportersThe emails show that Clintons campaign also worried about the influence of Sen Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) over the left wing of the party and the possibility that she might endorse SandersIn October 2015 as Sanders was attracting huge crowds on the campaign_trail Grunwald asked whether Clinton should modify her views on a proposed banking regulation to mollify WarrenI am still worried that we will antagonize and activate Elizabeth Warren by opposing a new Glass-Steagall Grunwald wrote I worry about defending the banks in the debateAn excerpt of one of Clintons paid speeches show some aides were concerned that her comments seemed like an admission that she is out of touchAnd Clinton mused about her own shortcomings and challenges with being a more authentic candidate in an off-the-record interview she had with New_York Times journalist Mark Leibovich in the summer of 2015Im trying to let people into my_life she said according to the transcript Im trying to relate to people not relate to them you know talk about being a grandmother talk about you know the experiences I had growing up and all that Talk about my own mother And in that way kind of make connectionsThe leaked emails also offer a glimpse of the often plodding nature of her campaign While Trump often speaks off the cuff and his staff doesnt even know some of what hell say most everything Clinton does is scriptedOn an email chain in October 2015 that included more_than a dozen aides there was great debate over whether Clinton should tell a joke at an Iowa dinner about her grueling 11-hour testimony before a House panel investigating the Benghazi attackAs described the joke which was apparently suggested by Bill_Clinton involved the former secretary of state half-expecting Sanders to burst in during hour eight of her testimony and repeat his famous debate line Enough about your damn emails HillaryIn the end the line never saw the light of dayI defer if others think this buys us good will with Sanders people Podesta wrote But email jokes in Iowa usually end up badly and dont we want to move on Anu Narayanswamy Sean Sullivan Carol Morello and Ellen_Nakashima contributed to this reportWhen BuzzFeed published that now-infamous dossier of unproven claims about Donald Trump and Russia in January former Hillary_Clinton campaign aides expressed outrage that news outletsthat had obtained the dossier before Election_Day did_not make its contents public in time to influence voters and Clinton lateraired the same grievancein her book about the presidential raceIt turns out that the reaction of the Democratic presidential nominee and her team was disingenuous The Washington_Post reported on Tuesday night that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic_National Committee helpedfund the dossier compiled by a former_British intelligence_officer through a law_firm hired to conduct opposition researchThe Clinton camp left out its own role in the dossiers creation as it ripped the media for sitting on information that journalists had been unable to verify What Clinton and her advisers presented as their judgment that themedia had made the wrong call was in fact their frustration at having failed to plant negative news reports before ballots were cast Recall that BuzzFeed published the dossier in full on Jan 10 after CNN reported that the FBI had briefed President_Barack Obama and then-President-elect Trump on its contents Many journalists criticized BuzzFeeds decision arguing that news outlets should not spread claims they cant corroborate even if the FBI considers the claims significant enough to share with the president and his soon-to-be successorBut Clinton press aides Brian Fallon and Nick Merrill contended on Twitter that the real journalistic malpractice was not publishing information contained in the dossier earlierThis was long rumored during the campaign and many reporters know at_least some of what Russia was alleged to have Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) Today has brought a gush of reporting that outlets knew about and sat on prior to November 8cc Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) I repeat certain media outlets were told this prior to November 8 Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) In fact if we want to get specific one outlet a very very prominent outlet threw cold water on this when Slate beat them to the punch Nick Merrill (@NickMerrill) Merrill was referring to the New_York Times which on Oct 31 2016 that the FBI had chased a lead which they ultimately came to doubt about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank Journalist Franklin Foer had reported on the possible secret channel earlier that dayAlso that day Mother Jones magazine that a former senior intelligence_officer for a Western countryhadprovided the [FBI] with memos based on his recent interactions with Russian sources contending the Russian_government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trump and that the FBI requested more information from him The memos comprised the dossier that BuzzFeed later publishedConsistent with the Mother Jones report the Times reported that intelligence officials have said in interviews over the last six weeks that apparent connections between some of Mr Trumps aides and Moscow originally compelled them to open a broad investigation_into possible links_between the Russian_government and the Republican presidential candidateStill the Times added throwing the cold water Merrill spoke of they have said that Mr Trump himself has not become a target And no_evidence has emerged that would link him or anyone else in his business or political circle directly to Russias election operationsClinton complained about the Times report in her post-election book What HappenedIn the summer of 2016 according to The Washington_Post the FBI convinced a special Foreign_Intelligence Surveillance Court that there was probably cause to believe that Trump adviser Carter_Page was acting as a Russian agent and the received a warrant to monitor his communications The FBI also began investigating a dossier prepared by a well-respected former_British spy that contained explosive and salacious allegations about compromising_information the Russians had on Trump The intelligence_community took the dossier seriously enough that it briefed both President_Obama and President-elect Trump on its contents before the inaugurationSources within the FBI also convinced the New_York Times to run a story saying they saw no clear link to Russia countering Franklin Foers scoop in Slate about unusual computer traffic between Trump_Tower and a Russian bankNote that Clinton described the dossier only as having been prepared by a well-respected former_British spy as if the spy Christopher_Steele had acted on his own Clinton certainly gave no indication that her campaign helped finance his workThere is a fundamental contradiction here Clinton wanted the dossier to be viewed as credible yet she did_not want to be connected to it She hoped the media before Election_Day would publish claims about Trump to which she was unwilling to attach her own nameThe nations capital lost out on hosting the Gay_Games 2022 to Hong Kong the federation of Gay_Games announced Monday afternoon Mayor Muriel E Bowser (D) and 23 city

there with Manafort connected him with one of the countrys most_powerful politicians Viktor_Yanukovych Back home corporations linked to Manafort purchased a unit in Trump_Tower for $37million and then two other high-priced apartments in New_York while Manafort and his wife bought a new house in FloridaThis spring Manafort returned to the US spotlight from the wilderness of Eastern European politics and business to run Republican Donald Trumps presidential campaign Manafort was considered a steady professional who could stabilize the chaotic operation while the campaign offered him a chance to reclaim a major role in US politics Manaforts reentry sputtered this week as Trump diminished his role selecting two other strategists to take charge even as Manafort retained his title of chairmanThe campaign shake-up followed reports this week that Manaforts name had surfaced in an inquiry by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of UkraineThe agency has been investigating claims that Yanukovych who won the presidency with Manaforts help in 2010 and others aligned with his Party of Regions stole up to $100billion in assets before Yanukovych fled to Russia in 2014Investigators said this week that they discovered a black ledger showing that $127million had been designated for Manafort between 2007 and 2012 by Yanukovychs party The anti-corruption agency published a list Thursday on its page of the alleged payments showing 22 installments assigned to ManafortManafort issued a strong denial this week in response to reports of the alleged payments saying that he never received a single off-the-books cash payment and that he never represented the governments of Ukraine or Russia He said his firm received payments for political work in the country and called the alleged secret cash payments first reported by the New_York Times unfounded silly and nonsensicalNeither Manafort nor his attorney responded to requests for further commentThe discovery of the ledger could trigger scrutiny of Manaforts connections to Ukraine by FBI officials who have been on the ground in Kiev working under a June agreement with the anti-corruption agencyFBI officials declined to comment on the specifics of the agencys involvement Peter Carr a spokesman said that we remain committed to helping recover stolen assets on behalf of the people of UkraineManaforts 2005 entry into Ukrainian politics and finances came when he signed on as an adviser to the steel magnate Rinat Akhmetov one of Ukraines richest oligarchs and a key supporter of Yanukovych and the Party of Regions according to interviews with Ukrainians and Americans who worked with ManafortManaforts first job was to burnish the local and international reputation of a company owned by Akhmetov based in the Russian-speaking industrial Donetsk regionAkhmetov was one of several oligarchs involved with the Party of Regions which was led largely by men who made a quick fortune after the Soviet Union dissolved and Ukraine became a financial free-for-allThe report said that a third of the 50 wealthiest oligarchs in Ukraine belonged to the party and together had an estimated wealth of $354billion according to a report by the private intelligence firm StratforOver time Manaforts role with the party expanded He was tasked with rehabilitating the image of the partys leader Yanukovych who had been imprisoned twice according to people_familiar with Manaforts work thereIt was in the words of John E Herbst the US ambassador at the time an extreme makeover according to a cable he sent Washington that was subsequently published by the WikiLeaks organizationManafort and half a dozen businessmen lawyers and political analysts involved in Ukraine at the time brought discipline and focus that the Yanukovych-led campaigns had lackedHe got Yanukovych to comb his hair better to stay on message during public appearances and to adopt the kind of sharp rhetoric that had worked so well for Manaforts mentor Republican strategist Lee AtwaterPaul gave the team a belief in victory said Hanna Herman a former press_secretary and close adviser to Yanukovych That was his higher purpose Then all the professional American tactics he brought also helpedTaras Chornovil a former member of the Party of Regions recalled in an interview how Manafort provided image consulting to Yanukovych and members of his party during the parliamentary elections of 2006 and 2007 seeking to soften the edges of politicians from the rough industrial cities in Ukraines southeastHe drilled them on talking_points and told them what suits to wearHe tried to control everything Chornovil recalled How people who represented the party would be dressed the words they said their makeup and the stylists Every small detailYevgen Kopachko a pollster who worked with Yanukovych on parliamentary and presidential campaigns said that Manafort had a phenomenal ability to work with sociological informationUkrainian political consultants said that Yanukovych grew to trust Manafort and that Yanukovychs victory in the 2010 presidential_election was considered proof that Manaforts approach was successfulSince Yanukovych became president that means he worked pretty effectively said Boris Kolesnikov a former Party of Regions lawmaker and Yanukovych allyIn Washington Manafort and his team met with State_Department officials and other opinion leaders to convince them that Yanukovych was a pro-Western democrat who supported NATO and was willing to work more closely with Washington said several colleagues and former US officials Manafort tried to influence US officials into thinking that Yanukovych was redeemable a guy who could be oriented toward the West said one former senior State_Department official who met with him at the time and spoke on the condition of anonymityManafort did_not however register as a foreign agent or as a lobbyist in Washington for his work with Ukraine Two well-known Washington firms that helped with the Ukrainian lobbying effort Mercury LLC and the Podesta_Group registered as lobbyists but not as foreign agentsAlthough it is common for US political consultants to work for overseas candidates and political parties ethics_experts say that anyone who is directly paid by a foreign government or political party for work in the United_States must register as a foreign agent under the Foreign_Agents Registration_Act Officials at Mercury a Republican-leaning firm and Podesta a Democratic-oriented firm led by Tony Podesta the brother of Hillary_Clinton adviser John D Podesta said they received signed assurances that the money they received came from a Brussels-based nonprofit called the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine not from any government or political party The two lobbying_firms whose work linked to Manafort was first reported by the registered under the Lobbying Disclosure Act rather_than the Foreign_Agents Registration_Act on the advice of an attorney Had the firms been advised that the foreign-agent registry was appropriate we would have gladly registered under FARA said Kimberley Fritts chief_executive of the Podesta GroupAs Manafort built a political consulting practice in Ukraine he also developed financial connections with wealthy figures in the region some of whom face ongoing scrutiny from the Justice DepartmentIn 2008 he tried to develop an $850million Manhattan luxury apartment project with Dmitry Firtash a Ukrainian energy tycoon with a history of legal trouble US prosecutors charged Firtash in 2013 with money-laundering and bribery as part of a broad international corruption investigation and have sought his extradition although Firtashs attorneys have called the effort politically motivatedManaforts alleged role in the deal was detailed in documents submitted as part of a 2011 New_York lawsuit that accused Firtash of working with Manafort and others to invest ill-gotten profits from energy transactions in Ukraine Manafort denied wrongdoing and the case against Manafort and Firtashs energy company ultimately was dismissedIn another business venture Oleg Deripaska a Russian aluminum magnate accused Manafort in a court in the Cayman Islands of taking nearly $19million intended for investments then not accounting for the money returning it or responding to numerous inquiries about exactly how the money was usedIn his legal filing Deripaska said he expected that the money would be used to make acquisitions in Russia Ukraine and other countries in eastern and southern Europe Instead the petition argues the partnership made only one purchase buying a stake in Ukrainian cable television and Internet ventures Deripaska squeezed by the 2008 credit crunch asked for the partnership to be liquidated and his money returned according to Deripaskas petition But the filing said it was unclear who was controlling the Ukrainian cable TV and Internet assets and what_happened to the money Deripaska initially provided Richard Hibey Manaforts attorney did_not respond to repeated Washington_Post requests for comment on the current status of the disputeManaforts financial connections to the region along with those of other top Trump advisers have fueled concerns among US national_security experts about Trumps foreign_policy positions which included praising Russian President_Vladimir Putin and expressing some doubt about the US commitment to NATO countries that have not paid their share of defense costsAs the controversy regarding Manafort and Ukraine swelled this week Manafort said he had cut his ties with his Ukrainian client in 2014But colleagues in Kiev and Moscow said he continued to work for the Party of Regions now called the Opposition Bloc led by Yanukovychs former chief of staff and was seen in the country as recently as last yearHe was with the Opposition Bloc said one colleague who said he saw him in Kiev in October adding that Manafort said he was in Kiev to negotiate for money he was owed for consulting with the new partyUkrainian business registration records reviewed by The_Post show that Manafort

Anu Narayanswamy in Washington contributed to this reportIf President Trump is the finicky client describing what he wants for a monstrous wall-building project along the Mexican border Stephen Colbert is the flummoxed architect trying to fashion a blueprint from his bombastic adjectivesOn The Late_Show Friday night Colbert assembled a team of builders to come up with a ballpark estimate of how_much it would cost to erect the presidents promised wallThe answer a lot based on Trumps descriptionsThat wall is going to be so big and so strong and so powerful then-candidate Trump said at a campaign stop in Holderness NHImpenetrable physical tall powerful he said in another speechWe know the length of the United_States southern border about 2000miles Colbert said and Trump gave people watching the GOP debate in Houston a sense of how tall it would be A heck of a lot taller than the ceiling youre looking atThat was all Colbert needed to pull out his whiteboard and start in on some simple calculations Colberts efforts are a comedic version of what builders have been doing since Trump was elected after making campaign promises about a massive border wallUS Customs and Border Protection has said it plans to start awarding contracts for the wall by mid-April Concept papers were due Friday its unclear_whether Colbert submitted oneThe candidate field will be narrowed by March 20 and finalists would submit offers with their proposed costs by March 24Trump has suggested the wall would cost $12 billion the AP reported Republican leaders say it would cost between $12 billion and $15 billion although an internal Department of Homeland_Security report for Secretary John_F Kelly said the final total could reach $21 billion Colberts estimate came in a heck of a lot higher 200 million cubic yards of wall his team of builders concluded would mean $400 billion just for concreteThat number more_than doubled to $985 billion when the team factored in other costs 12000 workers portable concrete plants a road next to the wall and the cost of draining swamps along the borderTotal cost $2 trillionBut that doesnt account for another of Trumps adjectives beautiful Beautifying the border wall would take something like 100 million rolls of wallpaper one of Colberts experts estimatedClearly the costs were adding up Fortunately at_least for the United_States Trump has announced where he would send the billAnd Colbert had the Mexican Consulate on speed dialThis is Stephen Colbert from The Late_Show he told the woman who answered the phone Were trying to come up with just some rough numbers Obviously dont hold my feet to the fire over this but weve got a rough number of $2 trillion to build the border wall and I was wondering if you had that in petty cash right nowFor hundreds of years this small-scale city in Englands industrial north has been synonymous with pottery colorful plates bowls and tiles fired by workers in the heat of the local kilns and sold in fine ceramics shops the world overBut come Thursday Stoke-on-Trent could be known less for shaping crockery than for smashing itThe British political order virtually unchanged for a century as the Conservative and Labour parties have traded control is under threat of a populist-infused realignment as the UK Independence Party seeks to capitalize on its success inHaving helped to push Britain toward the departure lounge of the European_Union the anti-immigration UKIP is now seeking to displace Labour as the countrys natural home for working-class votersAnd a Thursday election here to fill a vacant parliamentary seat while minor in the overall calculus of British power could be a telling indicator of just how far the countrys politics have shifted in Brexits wakeTo the right-wing UKIP the seat represents a prime opportunity to break through with working-class voters who have for decades habitually backed the center-left Labour Party but who feel increasingly disconnected from the partys cosmopolitan white-collar outlookKnown for its pottery the area is blessed with exceptional clay Stoke still produces vast quantities But its once-burgeoning coal industry has disappeared and the areas tidy central shopping district is pocked with vacant storefrontsLike Rust Belt residents who helped deliver the White_House to Donald Trump Stokes working class last_year defied the pleas of Labour leaders who advocated for Britain to stay in the EU and instead made this city the Brexit capital of Britain with nearly 70percent of voters opting for outNow UKIP is hoping to convert those Brexit voters into supporters and in the process win just its third parliamentary seat since its founding nearly a quarter-century agoPolitics is changing said Paul Nuttall a mild-mannered academic who succeeded the bombastic Nigel Farage as UKIP leader and is campaigning to represent Stoke Its not just changing in this country Its changing all over the worldUnlike Farage who focused UKIP firepower in the more traditionally conservative country landscapes of southern England Nuttall has zeroed in on the struggling postindustrial centers of Englands north Traditionally Labour strongholds they have become vulnerable as the party has become more detached from its roots Nuttall said in an interview at the partys purple-streaked offices in the citys centerThe Labour Party is more London-centric than its ever been They talk about the issues that may concern an Islington dinner party climate_change Palestine free_trade human_rights Nuttall said referring to the trendy north-London neighborhood that happens to be home to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn But those are not the issues on the doorstep in working-class areas Those issues are immigration cutting foreign-aid budgets law and order and putting British people firstThe echoes of Trump are no accident even if Nuttall insists that unlike Farage he didnt support the New_York billionaireUKIP is hoping to use at_least part of the Trump playbook and ride a populist wave to powerBut Labour has recognized the threat and is waging a determined battle to keep a seat it has held for nearly 70 years from falling into the hands of the far rightThis is a defining moment said Jack Dromey a Labour member of Parliament who is directing the partys campaign here Its the moment where either UKIP breaks through or we turn the tide against a grotesque populism purporting to be the party of the working classDromey a former union leader said voters in areas such as Stoke were right to feel discontent with a political establishment that hasnt always defended the interests of the working classTheres a distinct pride in Stoke Theres also a sense that Stoke is not the city it once was he said as party activists rushed in and out of party headquarters bearing stacks of red Labour leaflets I understand why people feel the way they doBut he depicted UKIP and Nuttall as opportunists seeking to capitalize on the working classs grievances for their own gainsUKIP is a party with no answers he said They simply seek to exploit discontentAnalysts say the outcome of Thursdays contest is impossible to predict with Labour UKIP and even the ruling Conservatives jousting over a seat that is normally so comfortably in Labours column that a vote count is hardly neededRob Ford a University of Manchester political scientist who co-wrote a book on UKIP said that Stoke with its high concentration of white working-class and less-educated voters is exactly the sort of seat UKIP has long covetedOn paper its an area where UKIP should do well he saidBut paradoxically its success in pushing Britain toward Brexit and Prime_Minister Theresa Mays insistence on following through on UKIP demands for a clean break with Europe may have blunted the partys appeal By promising to deliver on UKIPs core demand May and her ruling Conservative Party have co-opted the anger that fed last years referendum vote at_least for the time beingThe large dissatisfied and distrustful element is still out there Its just that theyre unusually happy right_now Ford said They wont stay that way for too longIf UKIP comes up short in Stoke it would mark a significant setback to Nuttalls strategy of broadening UKIPs appeal by targeting working-class voters The UKIP leader who was Farages longtime deputy has already been damaged by claims he inflated his connections to the 1989 Hillsborough disaster when 96 soccer fans were crushed to death at a crowded stadiumBut in many ways Labour and its leader Corbyn have more on the line The party is suffering from historically bad polling figures that should they hold point to a Tory rout in the next general election in 2020On Thursday Labour faces the prospect of losing not only Stoke but also another traditionally safe Labour seat Copeland where the Tories are running hardCorbyn who shocked Britain by emerging from the far-left backbenches to become party leader in late 2015 has been unable to satisfy the partys pro-EU progressive wing or its Euroskeptical working-class base If his party loses both seats Thursday Labour could drift even further into the political wildernessCorbyn is not their only problem Ford said But hes made all their problems worseThose problems are easy enough to see on the streets of StokeTo Peter Doyle a cheerful pub and hotel owner Corbyn is a waste of space who hasnt used his role to defend Britain from the most dire impacts of Brexit Instead of Labour which sometimes gets his vote Doyle will be backing the ardently pro-EU Liberal DemocratsIm in business Doyle said Ive just come through one of the biggest recessions in British history I dont_want to go through another oneBut to Graham Patrick a longtime pottery worker who is now retired Labours opposition to Brexit marks it as out of touchLabour hasnt done much for us said Patrick who wore a faded blue Yankees cap with a purple UKIP rosette pinned to his chest as he walked through

former presidents George_W Bush and Bill ClintonLewis said on Meet the Press that he would not extend an invitation to TrumpThe Chinese_tourists were hesitant for a second perhaps startled by their North_Korean guides perfect use of Chinese curse words perhaps surprised by the sentimentF--- the Japanese devils F--- their mothers Mr Lee the guide shouted out to a busload of visitors making a day trip across the Yalu River into Sinuiju North KoreaRecovering from their initial surprise most of the middle-aged Chinese visitors joined in F--- the Japanese devils F--- their mothers they cheered back with whistles and clapping in an expletive-filled echoIt was a bonding moment between the neighborsThe excursion into North_Korea from this border town in northeastern China took a group of 51 Chinese_tourists by turns curious and nostalgic into the land of the Kims Their small green bus which carried them over the river and back in time was for Chinese visitors only The people on the bus did_not want to be fully identified because it could go badly for them but here is their accountIts like going back to elementary school said Lin a professor from Fujian And that was not criticismFirst stop a central square in Sinuiju with its new bronze statues of Kim_Il Sung and Kim_Jong Il the first two generations of the worlds only communist dynasty The tourists were told to get gaudy bunches of flowers at $3 a pop that was $150 for North_Korea to place at the feet of the two KimsThey had not even left the square before the flower vendors began clearing away the flowers and placing them back in their plastic baskets for the next wave of tourists They should at_least wait until we leave said Gu a middle-aged businesswoman from Shenzhen They need to work on their skillsRelations between Beijing and Pyongyang have become strained in recent years as North_Korean leader Kim_Jong Un has repeatedly defied and snubbed Xi_Jinping the Chinese president who is three decades his senior and many multiples his powerBut even as economic and political ties wobble tourism has become an important source of foreign revenue for North_Korea and it is more easily extracted from Chinese_tourists who tend to be obedient and sympathetic than say Americans who have proved less so Many Chinese come for what might be described as communostalgia a chance to reminisce about the good old days of iron-fisted central planningWith Sinuiju not having a lot of what would be called in any other country tourist attractions the next stop was a museum at which the guide talked crying about the time Kim_Il Sung visited The unfazed Chinese_tourists quietly waited for it to endLuckily they soon found themselves in the museum gift shop where cases displayed creams and lotions made in the local cosmetics factory another of Sinuijus attractionsThis stuff is so cheap And its natural and pure North_Korea isnt polluted like China Gu said She bought a dozen gift sets That was $550 more for North KoreaBack on the bus Mr Lee a slickly dressed 27-year-old started his anti-Japanese tirade simultaneously shocking and uniting his audience But he did allow that not all Japanese people are bad Then Mr Lee led the group into a restaurant designed for tourists After a lunch of fried fish kimchi glass noodles and pork with potato North_Korean women in bright traditional dress began singing old Red Army songs transporting the older Chinese_tourists back to their youths Gu and her friends had tears in their eyes These are songs we sang when we were growing up one saidPretty young North_Korean women took middle-aged Chinese men with beer bellies by the hand and dragged them onstage to sing together while the guides snapped photosThe North_Korean tour guides were perhaps better proponents of Chinese nationalism than the officials Xi has dispatched to try to whip up domestic fervorAfter another gift shop the final stop on the tour was a kindergarten where 5-year-olds welcomed the tourists in Korean and Chinese The most popular performance featured five boys dressed as North_Korean soldiers going through field exercises Then out came two dressed as Japanese soldiers with rats tails and then one as a senior American officer with a wolfs tail The Chinese_tourists lapped it upYoung kids in China these days are too spoiled too materialistic said Qi a man from Liaoning province We should have more nationalist education in our schools Look at North_Korea They know how to educate kidsAt the end of the performance one of the guides announced that the teachers would happily accept any gifts for the children Some tourists offered pencils cookies and sausages they had brought from ChinaOn the bus others felt bad they had nothing to give Not to worry Mr Lee had a planThe children had trained for a whole year for this performance he said They have eaten bitterness he said using a Chinese phrase for enduring hardshipPassengers began handing over Chinese notes worth $750 or $15When they arrived at the tourist center on the border it was time to hand over something else This time it was their cameras which had to be checked for photos deemed undesirable As the North_Koreans were censoring the photos the guides came out with flashy individualized folders featuring pictures of each tourist at the sites they had visited There were photos of them singing with North_Korean women at lunch pictures from the museum and snapshots of a chance encounter in a park with a couple on their wedding dayThe tourists were surprised at all of the trouble the North_Koreans had gone to and so quickly Many did_not have photos of themselves And it was good to help the poor starving North_Koreans wasnt it More than half of the tourists handed over $30 for their folder exorbitant at local pricesTheyre very smart Lin said While our photos were being deleted they were selling us pictures From the first step we took in this land they had planned out exactly how to get our money Congcong_Zhang in Sinuiju North_Korea contributed to this reportScott Pruitt the head of the Environmental Protection Agency is poised to make wholesale changestothe agencys key advisory group by jettisoning scientists who have received grants from the EPA and replacing them with industry experts and state government officialsThe move represents a fundamental shift one that could change the scientific and technical advice that historically has guided the agency as it crafts environmental regulations The decision to bar any researcher who receives EPA grant money from serving as an adviser appears to be unprecedentedA list of expected appointees to the EPAs Science Advisory Board obtained by The Washington_Post from multiple individuals familiar with the appointmentsinclude several categories of experts voices from regulated industries academics and environmental regulators from conservative states and researchers who have a history of critiquing the science and economics underpinning tighter environmental regulations They would replace a number of scientists who currently have agency grants and whose terms areexpiringThe formal list of appointees is scheduled to be announced TuesdayTerry F Yosie who was the advisory boards director during the Reagan administration said the changes represent a major purge of independent scientists and a decision to sideline the SAB from major EPA decision-making in the futureThe EPA could not immediately be reached for comment but Pruitt suggested in a speech this month at the Heritage Foundation that he planned to rid the agencys scientific advisory boards of researchers with EPA funding He argued that the current structure raises questions about their independence though he did_not voice similar objections to industry-funded scientistsWhats most important at the agency is to have scientific advisers that are objective independent-minded providing transparent recommendations Pruitt If we have individuals who are on those boards sometimes receiving money from the agency that to me causes questions on the independence and the veracity and the transparency of those recommendations that are coming our wayAmong the likely appointees are sharp proponents of deregulation who have argued both in academic circles and while serving in government that federal regulators need to raise the bar before imposing new burdens on the private sectorJohn D Graham who now serves as dean ofIndiana Universitys School of Public and Environmental Affairs launched a major deregulatory push while head of the Office of Management and Budgets Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under George_W Bush He repeatedly informed agencies that they had not sufficiently justified the rules they wanted to enact establishing a process under the Data Quality Act that allowed petitioners to ask agencies to withdraw information that did_not meet OMB standards for quality objectivity utility and

Smith who serves as managing director of NERA Economic Consulting and co-heads its environmental practice belongs to a firm that has done extensive workfor groups that fought the Obama administrations regulatory agendaIn June President Trump cited a report NERA produced for the American Council for Capital Formation and the US Chamber of Commerce when announcing his decision to exit the international Paris climate agreement The report projected that meeting Americas commitment under the accord would mean as much as 27 million lost jobs by 2025That study was based on several assumptions including the idea that the United_States would meet its emissions targets not by maximizing energy efficiency or other low-cost approaches but by forcing the industrial sector to cut emissions by 40 percent between 2005 and 2025 The report did_not take into account potential benefits from cutting greenhouse gas emissions or technological advances that could make cutting carbon emissions cheaperAfter Trumps use of these statistics drew criticism NERA issued a statement saying that the 2016 reportstudy was not a cost-benefit analysis of the Paris agreement nor does it purport to be oneAt least three of thelisted appointees have backgrounds working for large corporations whose activities are or could potentially be regulated by the EPA including the French oil giant Total Phillips 66 and Southern Co one the largest US utilitiesOne of them Larry Monroe was previously chief environmental officer at Southern which hasmillions of customers in the Southeast Monroe has particular expertise in how the EPA regulated emissions from coal-fired power plants and criticized the Obama administrations Clean Power Plan which Pruitt is trying to roll backMonroe argued that the plan which was intended to reduce carbon emissions was unworkable and would increase electricity prices to customers while hurting reliabilityIn addition the group of new appointees include those who have like Pruitt battled the EPA in the pastThey include Michael Honeycutt head of the Texas Commission on Environmental Qualitys toxicology division he hasthat the health risks associated with smog are overstated Another expected appointeeisDonald van der Vaart the former secretary of the North CarolinaDepartment of Environmental Quality who has called Obama-era efforts to slash carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and to regulate water quality in the nations rivers and wetlands glaring examples of federal overreachThe move toprohibit anyone receivingEPA grant money from serving on the board has prompted questions and criticism from independent researchers and from some of the agencys current advisers who noted that they follow strict ethics procedures to avoid conflicts of interestRobyn Wilson an Ohio State University professor and an advisory board member who specializes in risk analysis said in an interview Monday that she received a grant this year to work on a project evaluatingthe extent to which federal funds spent on restoring the Great Lakes have made an impact The agency approved a roughly $750000 grant that will be divided among about 10 researchers at three different institutions about $150000 would go to Ohio StateYou want people there with expertise who have experience with the issues EPA is dealing with Wilson said adding that with each assignment board members must go through a pretty elaborate conflict of interest process to make clear that they dont have a stake in the outcomeI just study how farmers make decisions she added Whether EPA regulates something or not that doesnt play into what I doAngela Nugent who previously worked for the EPA as the designated federal officer for the board said that the determination regarding EPA grants would differ from how the agency used to determine when a conflict of interest had occurredIt would be a major departure from current policy to assume that board members have a conflict of interest based on their grants without looking at the actual situation in which they are being asked to do their work and how those grants might affect it she saidIn the past Nugent said the board has required financial disclosures from members in relation to each particular study or project on which they were advisingDeterminations of conflict of interest were then made relating to the specifics of the subject matter conflicts rather_than a blanket bar because an individual had an EPA grantCurrent advisory members reached out to Pruitt on Sept 13 formally asking him to meet with them so they could discuss his agenda and their role in advising the agencySuch a meeting would afford you the opportunity to highlight EPA activities and priorities and would allow for a dialogue on how best the SAB can work to ensure the highest quality science supports Agencys policies and decisions wrote board chair Peter Thorne a professor of occupational and environmental health at the

Britain wrested control of a seat from the opposition between general electionsWelcome to Trudy Harrison Copelands first Conservative MP since 1935 Conservatives (@Conservatives) Once the naturalhome of Britains working class the Labour Party has seen disaffected voters lured away by anti-immigrant platforms Itsembattled leader leftist Jeremy Corbyn is fighting apitched battle with the moderate factions that have controlled theparty since the ascent of Tony BlairLabourbetween members of a working-class base who want out of the EU and a young urban and progressive contingent that favors staying in my colleague Griff Witte last_week Corbyn has alienated both factions reluctantly favoring remain last June and putting up only halfhearted resistance to Mays plansAll the while Labour lagging far behind the Conservatives Some analysts even suggest that Britain under Conservative Prime_Minister Theresa May is turning into with May more concerned about internal divisions on the right than the challenge posed by the left said Alex Callinicos a European studies professor at Kings College London in Social-democratic parties may have helped fashion Europes welfare states and enshrined workers rights but in recent years many have become synonymous with the corporatized faceless establishmentThe merger of traditional social democracy with neoliberalism and globalized free-market policies has fallen apart in fairly disastrous fashion said CallinicosThe situation is also dire for the center-left in the Netherlands which holds elections this month The focus there is on the contest between far-right anti-Muslim candidate Geert Wilders and the countrys center-right classically liberal Prime_Minister Mark RutteGeert Wilders PVV slips to second place in poll of polls two weeks before Dutch election Peter Thal Larsen (@peter_tl) The Dutch Labor party which allied itself with Rutte in a coalition government It appears to behemorrhaging voters to both the anti-immigrant

center-lefts inability to hold onto its working-class base They have felt most of the crisis said referring to the toll of the 2008 global financial crisis We have to find a solution for that rather_than telling them its all somebody elses fault which holds its presidential_election in AprilFrench President Francois Hollande an unpopular Socialist has been a lame-duck leader for months The French left divided intoa constellation ofcompeting personalities and interests will likelynot be able to rival the bids of far-right leaderMarine Le_Pen centrist Emmanuel Macron or even the center-rights Francois Fillon who despite being still commands greater support than any leftist candidateEven in countries without ascendantfar-right movements such as Spain and Italy the is hobbled by The solution argue some politicians is a return to the core strengths of left-leaning parties The best thing to do is to fight our own battle for social rights solidarity and equality president of the Party of European Socialists a center-left bloc in the European parliament This is our winning strategy and this is where we should aim our powerful left punchIt is nonsense to suggest that the moderate European left is a political carcass But its electorate is deeply split One side consists of less well-off voters with conservative social values who feel under siege from EU policies and globalization The other consists of affluent cosmopolitan liberals who like the EU and benefit from an open worldThere are still possibilities for center-left success in Europe this year In France

probably more united Europe will square off against a nationalist-populist US Or if their victories offer Democrats any inspiration the center-lefts resurgence could come on both_sides of the AtlanticGrard Araud Frances highly regarded ambassador to the United_States didnt mince words when I asked him what would happen if Marine Le Penwon the countrys upcoming presidential_election said Araud He explained that shouldLe Pen make good on her vowsto remove France from the European_Union and the eurozone these departures would trigger a political earthquake inthe WestIt means the collapse of the EU because the EU without France doesnt make any sense he said And it means the collapse of the euro and a financial crisis which will have consequences throughout the worldAraudspoke with Todays WorldView on Wednesday at the French embassy a vast and secluded compound on the leafy fringes of Georgetown Just a day earlier another French ambassador had seemingly broken diplomatic protocol to protest Le_Pen Thierry Dana Francesenvoy in Japan saying he would not serve in a government run by the far-rightIf the pieces of the French tragedy which are being put in place were to lead to her election I would stand aside from any diplomatic role Dana Araud on Twitter tweeted praise of Danas excellent articleTrs beau texte de mon homologue Tokyo Grard Araud (@GerardAraud) Le_Pen an ultra-nationalist who takes a hardline stance on immigration and Islam stands herbest chance yet to become president For now she isstill likely toBut in thewake of last years seismic political upheavals it would be foolish towrite her offAs Arauds tenure as Frances representative in the United Statesdraws to an end the 64-year-old can perhaps afford to be outspoken A career diplomat he has spent more_than a decade in the US in various posts including a stint as the French ambassador to the United_Nations He has watched with interest as his counterpartsin Washington come to grips with the new reality of life under PresidentTrumpThis city was in denial that something was happening said Araud gesturing to the capitals wonks and officialdom This city woke up on the ninth of November and its still under shockTill Nov 8 when I was asked whether our [own] far-right candidate would be elected my answer was no Suddenly I felt that I couldnt have the same answer Araud said He added that Trumps victory signaled that something major was happening in western democracies that Brexit was not an accident that we were facing a global crisis and that the world of our certainties was collapsing (Araud said as much on Twitterat the time provoking enough of a firestorm that he was )Like many other diplomats in Washington Araud says its too early to draw any real conclusions about the shape of US foreign_policy under Trump But officialsin European capitals have expressed general alarm over a vision of the global order that seems a radical rejection of longstanding American policiesMy advice to my authorities is to say try to forget the tweets and wait for the real policy said Araud He stressed that he has not had any hint from the new administration that Frances close relationship to the United_States willchangeI personally met Secretary [of Defense James] Mattis and his first sentence to me was that the French were the best allies of the US on the battlefield right_now said Araud a reference to French counterterrorism efforts in Syria Iraq and North AfricaMattis Vice_President Pence and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have all sought to reassure their European counterparts thatAmerican commitments wont change Next weeks visit to Washington by German Chancellor_Angela Merkelmay also generate more positive soundbitesI have spent twelve years of my_life in [the United States] but I have never felt the sort of paranoid frenzy that I see now on both_sides the sort of take-no-prisoners [approach to politics] and conspiracy theories he said What happened with the election comes on the top of a radicalization process that we are facing everywhere In Europe also our political life is much more radicalized than it was fifteen or twenty years agoWhileAraud is sanguine about the social tensions and economic inequities that have led us to this moment of crisis he also expressed bewildermentwith those in the United_States including who seem to be cheering the unraveling of the European_Union and the wider international liberal orderWhen you talk about the liberal order it isa Western order an American-led order said Araud before embarking on a bit of a history lesson The European_Union basically has two godfathers One is the president of the United_States and the other one is the pope In the 1950s Washington and the Catholic Church championed European integration as a bulwark against communismSo its a bit paradoxical to see the Americans joining the adversaries of what is an American order he said Thats a bit weirdPresident Trump pledged Friday that his administration remains committed to maintaining the United_States long-standing security alliance with Japan aiming to calm jitters in Tokyo over his inflammatory rhetoric on the campaign trailIn a news_conference with Prime_Minister Shinzo_Abe at the White_House Trump called the alliance the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Pacific region and he vowed to make ties between the two_countries even closerTrumps remarks on the alliance which hewed closely to statements of previous US presidents would not have been remarkable were it not for he aimed_at Japan during the 2016_presidential campaign He denounced a sizable US trade deficit to Japan and suggested Japan and South_Korea were not paying their share to support American troops based in the regionBut the summit aggressively pursued by the Japanese aimed to erase doubts even as the two sides remain at odds over how to move_forward on trade and economic tiesTrump sought to present the two_countries in close harmony over shared challenges on North_Koreas nuclear_weapons programs and Chinas aggression in the South China Sea both of which I consider a very very high priority he saidOn several occasions Trump gave Abe extended handshakes one in the Oval_Office lasted 19 seconds and patted him on the back displaying a personal warmth that has begun to develop between the two men since Abe became the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his election victory in November Strong hands Trump remarked in the Oval_Office mimicking a golf swing The two were scheduled to play a round this weekend at Mar-a-Lago Trumps winter retreat in Palm_Beach FlaI grabbed him and hugged him because thats the way we feel Trump said at the news_conference describing his greeting of Abe outside the West_Wing We have a very very good bond very very good chemistryIll let you know if it changes Trump added drawing laughs in the East Room before adding But I dont_think it will Abe who has made a concerted effort to court Trump since his election praised the presidents outsider candidacy and uphill struggle and fight to win the White HouseThe Japanese leader also pledged that his country would play a greater role in defense and security operations although he was vague on what that might entail Japans Self-Defense Forces are prohibited from combat missions abroad under the constitution imposed on the country by the United_States after World_War IIOf course there are disagreements Abe said but we should not close down the dialogue just by pointing to the differences and ignoring the common interests and common goalsThe summit was being watched closely by US allies and partners across the globe for signs over how Trump would deal with a powerful ally after the unpredictable bluster of his campaign and early weeks of his presidency Trump has clashed with the leaders of Mexico and Australia and his move to cancel US participation in a 12-nation Pacific Rim trade pact that includes Japan raised alarms over how he would receive AbeAfter finishing formal talks Trump and Abe left the White_House together through the South Lawn entrance and boarded Marine One followed by Trumps daughter Ivanka and her_husband Jared_Kushner a senior adviser to Trump Another Trump adviser Stephen_K Bannon also joined them on the presidential helicopter which whisked them past the Washington Monument on a flight path to Joint Base Andrews in Camp Springs Md where Air Force One was waitingThere the two leaders were met by their wives first lady Melania Trump and Akie Abe for the trip to Mar-a-Lago White_House officials said Trump plans to use the retreat for diplomatic bonding sessions in the way other presidents have used Camp DavidDuring the news_conference Trump was asked about his first phone conversation with Chinese President_Xi Jinping which had come Thursday evening The White_House said Trump reaffirmed his administration would honor Beijings One China policy that stipulates Taiwan is officially part of China despite the island having a separate governmentTrump angered Beijing by receiving a congratulatory phone_call from Taiwans president after his election and publicly questioning the One China policy suggesting his administration might renounce it unless China offered better trade deals to the United StatesOn Friday Trump characterized the call with Xi as very very warmI think we are on the process of getting along very well he saidFor his part Abe largely avoided talking in specifics about Trumps decision to break with his predecessor and withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership a 12-nation Pacific Rim free-trade deal that Trump opposed during the campaignBut he did promise that Japan would support Trumps economic growth strategyThere will be even more new jobs born in the US Abe saidTrump promised that the United_States would be an even bigger player than it is right_now by a lot when it comes to tradeIn a joint statement the two nations said Trump accepted Abes invitation to visit Japan later this yearAnd in another gesture of goodwill Abe made sure to praise Trumps golf gameMy scores in golf are not up to the level of Donald at all Abe said in Japanese according to a translatorIt was not clear however whether Trump understood him the president failed to attach the earpiece of his translation device until after Abes opening statementInvestigators are focusing on a series of meetings held by Jared_Kushner President Trumps son-in-law and an influential White_House adviser as part of their probe into Russian_meddling in the 2016 election and related matters according to people_familiar with the investigationKushner who held meetings in December with the Russian_ambassador and a banker from Moscow is being investigated because of the extent and nature of his interactions with the Russians the people saidThe Washington_Post reported last_week that a senior White_House official close to the president was a significant focus of the high-stakes investigation though it did_not name KushnerFBI agents also remain keenly interested in former Trump national_security adviser_Michael Flynn and former Trump campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort but Kushner is the only current White_House official known to be considered a key person in the probeThe Post has not been told that Kushner is a target or the central focus of the investigation and he has not been accused of any wrongdoing Target is a word that generally refers to someone who is the main suspect of investigators attention though prosecutors can and do bring charges_against people who are not marked with that distinctionMr Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry said Jamie Gorelick one of his attorneysIn addition to possible_coordination between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign to influence the 2016_presidential election investigators are also looking broadly into possible financial crimes but the people_familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly did_not specify who or what was being examined Sarah Isgur Flores a Justice_Department spokeswoman said I cant confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of investigations or subjects of investigations The FBI declined to comment At the time of the December meetings Trump already had won the election Contacts between people on the transition team and foreign governments can be routine but the meetings and phone calls with the Russians were not made public at the timeIn early December Kushner met in New_York with the Russian_ambassador to the United_States Sergey_Kislyak and he later sent a deputy to meet with Kislyak Flynn was also present at the early-December meeting and later that month Flynn held a call with Kislyak to discuss US-imposed sanctions against Russia Flynn initially mischaracterized the conversation even to Vice_President Pence ultimately prompting his ouster from the White HouseKushner also met in December with Sergey Gorkov the head of Vnesheconombank which has been the subject of US sanctions following Russias annexation of Crimea and its support of separatists in eastern UkraineIn addition to the December meetings a former senior intelligence official said FBI agents had been looking closely at earlier exchanges between Trump associates and the Russians dating to the spring of 2016 including one at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington Kushner and Kislyak along with close Trump adviser and current attorney_general Jeff_Sessions were present at an where then-candidate Trump promised in a speech to seek better relations with Russia It is unclear_whether Kushner and Kislyak interacted thereThe that Kushner omitted from security-clearance forms his December meetings with Kislyak and Gorkov though his attorney said that was a mere error and he told the FBI soon after that he would amend the forms The White_House said that his meetings were and inconsequentialKushner has with the Senate_Intelligence Committee which is conducting one of several investigations into Russian_meddling in the 2016 electionIn many ways Kushner is a unique figure inside the White HouseHe is arguably the presidents most trusted adviser and he is also a close member of the presidents family His list of policy responsibilities is vast his foreign_policy portfolio alone includes Canada and Mexico China and peace in the Middle_East yet he rarely speaks publicly about any of themFormer FBI_director Robert_S Mueller_III is now leading the probe into possible_coordination between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign and he has set_up shop in the Patrick Henry Building in downtown DC Even before he was picked by Deputy Attorney_General Rod J Rosenstein to take over the case investigators had been stepping up their efforts issuing subpoenas and looking to conduct interviews people_familiar with the matter saidA small group of lawmakers known as the Gang of Eight was recently notified of the change in tempo and focus in the investigation at a classified briefingIt is unclear exactly how Muellers leadership will affect the direction of the probe This week Justice_Department ethics_experts even though lawyers at his former firm WilmerHale represent several people who could be caught up in the matter including Kushner Manafort and Trumps daughter Ivanka who is married to KushnerMueller resigned from the firm to take over the investigationInvestigators are continuing to look aggressively into the dealings of Flynn and a grand_jury in Alexandria Va recently issued a subpoenas for records related to Flynns businesses and finances according to people_familiar with the matterFlynns company the Flynn Intel Group was paid more_than $500000 by a company owned by a Turkish American businessman close to top Turkish officials for research on Fethullah Gulen a cleric who Turkeys president claims was responsible for a coup attempt last_summer Flynn retroactively registered with the Justice_Department in March as a paid foreign agent for Turkish interestsSeparately from the probe now run by Mueller Flynn is being investigated by the Pentagons top watchdog for his foreign payments Flynn also received $45000 to appear

that the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil Waronce again thrusting himself into the public spotlight on an emotionally charged issueThe comments made on the debut night of conservative media host Laura Ingrahams show on Fox_News came after Kelly was asked about the recent decision by a Virginia church to that honoredthe Confederate general and George WashingtonI would tell_you that Robert_E Lee was an honorable man Kelly told Ingraham He was a man that gave up his country to fight for his state which 150 years_ago was more important than country It was always loyalty to state first back in those days Now its different today But the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War and men and women of good faith on both_sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their standThe commentscame in the midst of an interview that touched on a wide range of topics including the indictments in the investigation by special_counsel Robert F Mueller the United_States relationship with China and Kellys work as the secretary of the Department of Homeland SecurityLong seen as a force of order anddiscipline in the White_House the retired Marine

showKelly made the comments as part of a larger point about historyas it is seen througha modern lensI think we make a mistake though and as a society and certainly as as individuals when we take what is today accepted as right and wrong and go back 100 200 300 years or more and say what those you know what Christopher Columbus did was wrong he said You_know 500 years later its inconceivable to me that you would take what we think now and apply it back then The comments quickly touched off a cascade of strong reactionsamong progressives on social_media author Ta-Nehisi Coates pointed out that myriad compromises were made before the first battles of the Civil WarI mean like its called The three fifths compromise for a reason he wrote But it doesnt stand alone Missouri Compromise Kansas-Nebraska ActLincolns own platform was a compromise Lincoln was not an abolitionist He proposed to limit slaverys expansion not end itDuring the Civil War Lincoln repeatedly sought to compromise by paying reparations to slaveholders and shipping blacks out the countryThat would make Robert_E Lee a traitor to the United_States and John Kelly a defender of said traitor Keith Boykin

reemerged as a particularly potent and emotional fight exploding into full view in August after a weekend of white nationalist rallies in Charlottesville protesting the planned removal of a Robert_E Lee statue devolved into violence Trumps comments on the rally brought the simmering racial tensions to the fore when he said there were very fine people on of the Of the push to take down the statue he saidYoure changing history youre changing cultureTo some Kellys comments on Monday echoed Trumps both-sides assertionsKelly on both sidesed the Civil WarGood people on both_sides who should have compromisedThe arrogant assertions of historyThe lack of understanding of the good and bad in our historyThe ugly messages in those assertions Joanne Freeman (@jbf1755) Many cities and stateshave begun debating how to addressthe Confederate statues that dot the South with many choosing to remove the monuments But the issue has taken an increasingly political turn since Charlottesville emerging asan in the gubernatorial race in VirginiaSome polls have shown that the public is divided about the statues and what they represent About 54 percent of Americans viewed the statues as symbols of Southern pride and not white supremacy to a poll from the Economist and YouGov in the summerWhile some contend that the Civil War was fought over states rights scholars that slavery was the primary driver of theconflictWhite House Chief of Staff John_F Kelly said Monday he would not apologize for the false attacks he leveled against Rep Frederica S Wilson (D-Fla) this month when he sought to defend President Trump for his handling of a condolence call to the widow of a fallen soldierOn Oct 19 ina rare appearance at the White Housemedia briefing Kelly attacked Wilson as an empty barrel and accused her ofgrandstanding at a public event two years_ago in Florida by takingcredit for securing federal funding for a new buildingVideo of the event soon released by the Florida Sun Sentinel showed Wilson did no such thing Rather she used her speech to praise the two slainFBI agents in whose memorythe building was namedWilson accused Kelly of character assassination and members of the Congressional Black Caucus demanded that Kelly apologizeIn an interview to be broadcast Monday_night Fox_News Channel host Laura Ingraham asked Kelly whether hehad something to apologize forOh no Kelly replied No Never Well Ill apologize if I need to But for something like that absolutely not I stand by my comments Kelly suggested that he may have been accusing Wilson of grandstanding in a private discussion as opposed to in her public speech although his comment to Ingraham was vagueIll go back and talk about before her comments and at the reception afterwards Kelly said Again it was a package deal Dont want to get into itKelly went on to say that Myeshia Johnson the widow of fallen Sgt La David Johnson has actedwithin her rights to speak out publicly about Trumps handling of his condolence callAs far as the young widow goes she has every right to say what she wants to say Kelly told Ingraham But its the politicization of something that was so from the heartIngrahams interview one of Kellys rare public appearances delved into a range of other topics including the removal of Confederate and other historical monuments an issue that has animated Trump in recent monthsIngraham asked Kelly about a historic church in Alexandria Va where former president George Washington worshiped deciding to remove plaques memorializing both Washington and Confederate general Robert_E Lee because they were considered intolerant Well historys history Kelly said And there are certain things in history that were not so good and other things that were very very good I_think we make a mistake though and as a society and certainly as individuals when we take what is today accepted as right and wrong and go back 100 200 300 years or more and say what those you know what Christopher Columbus did was wrongKelly added Human history our culture is an evolving thing There will be 100 or 200 years from now people that criticize us for what we do and I guess theyll tear down you know statues of people that we revere today I_think its dangerous I_think its just very very dangerous and it shows you what how_much of a lack of appreciation of history and what history isTry as he might Jon Stewart just cant stay off television On Tuesday the former Daily Show host once again joined his old friend Stephen Colbert on The Late_Show This time Stewart wanted to share his thoughts on the first 11_days of President Trump in the White HouseOf course he did so while wearing a very long tie and an animal skin cap Is this your Donald Trump impression Colbert inquired I thought this is how men dress now said Stewart who that he lives in Colberts studio since The Daily Show is off the air The president sets mens fashion super long tie dead animal on headStewart said he stopped by to deliver some news Hehad special exclusive access to even of Suddenly part of Stewarts animal hat fell in his face and he and Colbert could barely hold it together The audience also couldnt stop laughingPeople this nation is in crisis Stewart admonished This is seriousOnce the crowd settled down Stewart read his version of Trumps next executive orderBy the authority vested in me by the Constitution I Donald_J Jonah Jameson Trump hereby direct that to secure our border China shall immediately and without hesitation send us their wall Stewart said slipping into a Trump accent Done boom Done Boom Done Boom Done Chinas wall sent to us boom DoneHow then do we get ColbertaskedThis is the genius Stephen Stewart said When the wall arrives at the Southern border we shut the lights we pretend were not home Its COD Mexico has to sign for it Boom they pay for it doneStewart moved on to the next order I Donald_J Lincoln Kennedy Trump III do pronounceAmerica now finally has an official language the new official language of the United_States is bull-He paused for the audience to cheer I Donald_J Trump have instructed my staff to speak only in bull- By the way none of that Sure Im gonna talk bull- at work but at home Im_going to use facts and real information No Bull- all the time immersion its the only way to be fluentOn the final executive_order Stewart turned serious as he mostly lookeddirectly into the cameraI Donald_J Trump dodeclare by executive_order that I Donald_J Trump am exhausting It has been 11_days Stephen Eleven fing days Eleven The presidency is supposed to age the president not the publicThe reason that I Donald_J Trump am exhausting is that every instinct and fiber of my pathological self-regard calls me to abuse of power I Donald_J Trump want no not just your respect but your adoration Parades with the tanks and the synchronized dancing And why cant they train 10000 doves to spell out Trumpin the clouds How hard can it be theyre already flyingI Donald_J Trump am exhausting because it is going to take relentless stamina vigilance and every institutional check and balance this great country can muster to keep me Donald_J Trump from going full with the lightning coming out of the fingertips and the We have never faced this before purposeful vindictive chaos But perhaps therein lies the saving grace of my Donald_J Trumps presidency No one action will be adequate All actions will be necessary And if we do not allow Donald Trump to exhaust our fight and somehow come through this presidency calamity-less and constitutionally partially intact then I Donald_J Trump will have demonstrated the greatness of America just not the way I thought I was gonnaThe acting attorney_general informed the Trump White_House late last_month that she believed Michael_Flynn had misled senior administration officials about the nature of his communications with the Russian_ambassador to the United_States and warned that the national_security adviser was potentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail current and former US officials saidThe message delivered by and a senior career national_security official to the White_House counsel was prompted by concerns that Flynn when asked about his calls and texts with the Russiandiplomat had told Vice President-elect Mike_Pence and others that he had not discussed the on Russia for its interference in the 2016 election the officials said It is unclear what the White_House counsel Donald McGahn did with the information night in the wake of revelations about his contacts with the Russian_ambassador In the waning days of the Obama_administration James R Clapper Jr who was the director of national intelligence and John Brennan the CIA_director at the time shared Yatess concerns and concurred with her recommendation to inform the Trump White_House They feared that Flynn had put himself in a compromising position and thought that Pence had a right to know that he had been misled according to one of the officials who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence mattersA senior Trump administration official said before Flynns resignation that the White_House was aware of the matter adding that weve been working on this for weeksThe current and former officials said that although they believed that Pence was misled about the contents of Flynns communications with the Russian_ambassador they couldnt rule out that Flynn was acting with the knowledge of others in the transitionThe FBI Yates Clapper and Brennan declined to comment on the matter In a Feb8 interview with The Washington_Post Flynn categorically denied discussing sanctions with Russian_Ambassador Sergey_Kislyak repeating public assertions made in January by top Trump officials One day after the interview Flynn revised his account telling The_Post through a spokesman that he couldnt be certain that the topic never came upTwo officials said a main topic of the relevant call was the sanctions Officials also said there was no_evidence that Russia had attempted to exploit the discrepancy between public statements by Trump officials and what Flynn had discussed Flynn told The_Post earlier_this month that he first met Kislyak in 2013 when Flynn was director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and made a trip to MoscowUS intelligence reports during the 2016_presidential campaign showed that Kislyak was in touch with Flynn officials said Communications between the two continued after Trumps victory on Nov8 according to officials with access to intelligence reports on the matterKislyak in a brief interview with The_Post confirmed having contacts with Flynn before and after the election but he declined to say what was discussedFor Yates and other officials concerns about the communications peaked in the days after the Obama_administration on Dec29 announced measures to punish Russia for what it said was the Kremlins interference in the election in an attempt to helpTrumpAfter the sanctions were rolled out the Obama_administration braced itself for the Russian retaliation To the surprise of many US officials Russian President_Vladimir Putin announced on Dec30 that there would be no response Trump praised the decision on TwitterIntelligence analysts began to search for clues that could help explain Putins move The search turned up Kislyaks communications which the FBI routinely monitors and the phone_call in question with Flynn From that call and subsequent intercepts FBI agents wrote a secret report summarizing Flynns discussions with KislyakYates then the deputy attorney_general considered Flynns comments in the intercepted call to be highly significant and potentially illegal according to an official familiar with herthinkingYates and other intelligence officials suspected that Flynn could be in violation of an obscure US statute known as the Logan Act which bars US citizens from interfering in diplomatic disputes with another countryAt the same_time Yates and other law_enforcement officials knew there was little chance of bringing against Flynn a case related to the Logan Act a statute that has never been used in a prosecution In_addition to the legal and political hurdles Yates and other officials were aware of an FBI investigation looking at possible contacts between Trump associates and Russia which now included the Flynn-Kislyak communicationsWord of the calls leaked out on Jan12 in What did Flynn say and did it undercut US sanctions Ignatius wrote citing the Logan ActThe next day a Trump transition official told The_Post I can tell_you that during his call sanctions were not discussed whatsoeverWhite House_press secretary_Sean Spicer in a conference call with reporters on Jan13 said that the conversation between Flynn and Kislyak had centeredon the logistics of a post-inauguration call between Trump and Putin That was it plain and simple Spicer addedOn Jan15 Pence was asked about the phone_call during Citing a conversation he had with Flynn Pence said the incoming national_security adviser and Kislyak did_not discuss anything having to do with the United_States decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against RussiaBefore the Pence statement on Jan15 top Justice_Department and intelligence officials had discussed whether the incoming Trump White_House should be notified about the contents of the Flynn-Kislyak communicationsPences statement on CBS made the issue more urgent current and former officials said because US intelligence_agencies had reason to believe that Russia was aware that Flynn and Kislyak had discussed sanctions in their December call contrary to public statementsThe internal debate over how to handle the intelligence on Flynn and Kislyak came to a head on Jan19 Obamas last full day in officeYates Clapper and Brennan argued for briefing the incoming administration so the new president could decide how to deal with the matter The officials discussed options including telling Pence the incoming White_House counsel the incoming chief of staff or Trump himselfFBI Director_James B_Comey initially opposed notification citing concerns that it could complicate the agencys investigationClapper and Brennan left their positions when Trump was sworn in but Yates stayed on as acting attorney_general until Jan30 when for refusing to defend his executive_order temporarily barring refugees and people from seven majority-Muslim countries an action that had been challenged in courtA turning point came after Jan23 when Spicer in his first official media briefing again was asked about Flynns communications with Kislyak Spicer said that he had talked to Flynn about the issue again last night There was just one call Spicer said And it covered four subjects a plane crash that claimed the lives of a Russian military choir Christmas greetings Russian-led talks over the Syrian civil_war and the logistics of setting up a call between Putin and Trump Spicer said that was the extent of the conversationYates again raised the issue with Comey who now backed away from his opposition to informing the White_House Yates and the senior career national_security official spoke to McGahn the White_House counsel who didnt respond Monday to a request for comment his national_security adviser after the news brokeOn Monday afternoon Kellyanne_Conway counselor to the president said Trump had full confidence in Flynn Minutes later however Spicer delivered a contradictory statement to reportersThe president is evaluating the situation Spicers statement read Hes speaking to Vice_President Pence relative to the conversation the vice_president had with Gen Flynn and also speaking to various other people about what he considers the single most important subject there is Our national securityAnd then late Monday Flynn resigned Karen DeYoung and Greg Miller contributed to this reportAlternative facts are not facts They are falsehoods Chuck Todd tells Pres Trumps counselor Kellyanne_Conway this morning WATCH Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) If there is one video clip that describes the new reality for the political media and for the truth during the President Trump era it is the one aboveIts a discussion about White_House press_secretary Sean_Spicer on his first full day in that job having taken to the podium and about the size of Trumps inauguration crowdWhy put him out there for the very first time in front of that podium to utter a provable falsehood Chuck Todd Its a small thing but the first time he confronts the public its a falsehoodAfter some tense back and forth Conway offered thisDont be so overly dramatic about it Chuck Youre saying its a falsehood and theyre giving our press_secretary Sean_Spicer gave alternative facts to that But the point really is At this point a visibly exasperated Todd cut in Wait a minute Alternative facts Alternative facts Four of the five facts he uttered were just not true Alternative facts are not facts theyre falsehoodsFake news is so yesterday Alternative facts is where its at nowThis of course isnt the first time the Trump team and its supporters have responded to journalists calling out their falsehoods by claiming the truth isnt so black and white or that its not a big dealFormer Trump campaign_manager Corey_Lewandowski comparing Trump with a guy at the bar and saying Youre going to say things and sometimes you dont have all the facts to back it upThat same week pro-Trump CNN pundit Scottie Nell Hughes One thing thats been interesting this campaign season to watch is that people that say facts are facts theyre not really facts Everybody has a way its kind of like looking at ratings or looking at a glass of half-full water Everybody has a way of interpreting them to be the truth or not trueTheres no such thing unfortunately anymore of factsHughes is not an official spokesman for the Trump team but that last comment is basically what Conway is arguing today that there are so many shades of gray that clear facts just dont really existThis of course is a hugely cynical worldview But its about the only way the Trump team can fight back given how questionable Whether you like Trump or not its demonstrably true that he says things that are easily proved false over and over again The question the media has regularly confronted is not whether Trumps facts are correct but whether to say hes deliberately lying or notA memo is circulating on social_media right_now that claims to be from someone who worked in a past White_House and tries to explain what the Trump team is doingRe Spicers lies this is from someone who worked in a past administration Important read Anna Rascout-Paz (@rascouet) Its not clear where this memo came from but no matter the provenance it makes some good points Trump himself has been using his own brand of the truth which is often false for months And there was really no way that his administration wasnt going to have to deal with that same tendency during his presidencyOn Saturday in Spicers statement and now Sunday in Conways interview the two are attempting to set a precedent that says they dont recognize the concept of facts as the media has come to define them they have their own alternative facts and theyll rely on thoseAnd as brazen as it is its likely to appeal to that one-third of Americans the memo describes as being Trumps base Polls have regularly shown a large portion of Republicans are more apt to believe Trumps claims even if they are pretty patently false Its a symptom of media distrustThe New_York Timess Glenn Thrush tweeted this Saturday after Spicers statementPrediction There will be a poll out next week that will show 70-80% of Trump supporters believing that Mall photos were fake_news Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) Both fake_news and the concept of alternative facts are now cudgels in the effort to obfuscate when reporters point out that Trump and his team have their facts wrong Welcome to our new political reality or rather realitiesKellyanne Conway thinks she took too_much flak for to justify President Trumps travel_ban She said she simply and she later said Except now she doesnt appear to have misspoken at all she seems to have believed that the Bowling_Green massacre was a real thingHow do we know Because she cited the same nonexistent attack in separate interviews with two other outlets Cosmopolitan magazine and TMZWhile discussing why former president Barack_Obama halted refugees from Iraq in 2011 He did that because two Iraqi nationals came to this country joined ISIS traveled back to the Middle_East to get trained and refine their terrorism skills and come back here and were the masterminds behind the Bowling_Green massacre of taking innocent soldiers lives awayAnd she echoed those comments when that same day as Monday afternoonHe did that because I assume there were two Iraqis who came here got radicalized joined ISIS and then were the masterminds behind the Bowling_Green attack on our brave soldiers she saidConways version of events here is a mess The the two men admitted using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) against US soldiers in Iraq and attempted to send weapons and money to al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) for the purpose of killing US soldiers The FBI say the two men traveled back to the Middle_East to train for an attack And there was no attack on US soilConways initial quote last_week about Bowling_Green with MSNBCs Chris Matthews was that the Iraqis were the masterminds behind the Bowling_Green massacreAnd that she meant the men were the masterminds of the plot which was to send weapons to al-Qaeda in IraqBut masterminds is also a word that generally connotes a complex terrorist act And now we have these new quotesshowing Conway believed this Bowling_Green massacre involved overseas training and taking innocent soldiers lives away in Bowling_Green KyTrump supporters will dismiss this as quibbling given that the men did target US soldiers in Iraq But Trumps travel_ban is aimed_at preventing terrorism of which Bowling_Green isnt an example Yet Conway cited it three times as justification and seemed to believe a massacre occurred thereAnd it all goes back to a point I made last_week about what this says about the White Houses messaging operation A week after Trumps travel_ban was instituted Conway still Perhaps it could be excused as a slip of the tongue But in context its just more evidence of a White_House messaging operation that doesnt have its shoes on the right feet Time and again in the last two weeks Trumps top messengers have gotten their facts wrong mixed their messages and struggled to defend their boss There simply doesnt seem to be any planAdd this one to the list was offered to SOTU on Sunday by the White_House We passed Those are the facts CNN Communications (@CNNPR)For a few hours after a bombshell in which actor Anthony Rapp

of sexual assault GLAAD president Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statement This is not a coming out story about Kevin_Spacey but a story of survivorship by Anthony Rapp and all those who bravely speak out against unwanted sexual advancesEven worse they said was the implication that the two paragraphs in his statementmight be related in any wayKevin Spacey has set gay rights back fifty yearsby a) conflating homosexuality with Rapps allegations one Twitter user andb) Saying that being gay is a choice Soon Twitter was flooded with memes from people who were equally dumbfounded and angered by

is amplified here Victims voices are the ones that deserve to be heardIn reporter Ira Madison III called Spaceys decision to come out of the closet all the more cold and calculated seeing as he must know it could change the subject in the wake of Rapps allegationsTheres never truly a wrong time to come out and Id never begrudge anyone for accepting their sexuality Madison wrote But the seediness of using your coming out to deflect from a sexual assault allegation is something else entirelyKevin Spacey has just invented something that has never existed before a bad time to come out billy

Intl Emmy Awards (@iemmys)Kim Jong_Il the North_Korean leader who threatened the world with his nuclear_weapons ambitions and suppressed his own people with imprisonment and isolation left in the wake of his death Saturday an antiquated country with a power vacuum raises immediate questions about the future and the stability of perhaps the worlds most isolated state which for six decades has been held together by the Kim family personality cult Kim was deified by state_media described as the Dear Leader A weeping television anchor Monday told North_Korea of Kims deathSecurity analysts and officials from Seoul to Washington have long believed that Kims death would double as a pivot point on the Korean_Peninsula But that poses a threat of its own as North_Korea tries to pass power to Kims youngest son who is in his 20sIn an announcement Monday North_Korea called Kim_Jong Eun a great successor and urged its people to follow his leadership The state also test-fired two short-range missiles off its east coast according to South_Koreas Yonhap_News Agency Yonhap quoted an official in Seoul as saying the test most likely was part of a routine drill and was not related to Kim_Jong Ils death Until late last_year the younger Kim had lived his life almost entirely behind a wall of privacy But as his father struggled with his health he accelerated a controversial and in late September 2010 named Kim_Jong Eun to several top military and political posts This year when the elder Kim made his customary visits to military camps and factories across the country his son often accompanied him not as an equal but as a traineeOne concern described by numerous Korean security experts is that the younger Kim could face opposition from more senior North_Korean officials including Jang Song Thaek who had been acting as a caretaker for the transition In recent years Kim_Jong Il tried to minimize the power of other older party members often demoting them sometimes even banishing them to the countryside so they wouldnt form allies of their ownSince taking over from his father Kim_Il Sung in 1994 Kim kept a tight hold on North_Korean society using the juche ideology emphasizing national self-reliance to rationalize strict crackdowns on political opposition Those who spoke out against the Kim family were sent to prison camps defectors say along with their parents and childrenThe countrys leadership maintained a ban on most communication Most North_Koreans even now have no access to the Internet Several hundred thousand North_Koreans now have cellphones but they can make only domestic callsAs a result North_Korea dealt with almost no dissent a stark contrast to Arab countries that this year revolted against authoritarian rulers For almost two_decades now North_Korea has defied predictions of its demise Kims death sparked new concerns that the country could become less stableIn Tokyo Japanese leaders held an emergency security meeting South_Koreas Joint Chiefs of Staff put its front-line military on emergency alert with heightened concern about a provocation along the contested maritime border dipped more_than 45 percent amid the news of Kims deathIn recent years particularly since his apparent August 2008 stroke US intelligence_agencies had monitored Kims health closely But it was not clear whether they knew his death was imminent Kim took several trips this year to and Russia traveling by heavily armored trainAnalysts at the CIA and other agencies have warned that his demise could destabilize the country and make it more dangerousThis brings extraordinary change and uncertainty to a country that has seen little change in decades said one US official who spoke on the condition of anonymity South_Koreas concern is warranted frankly because an insecure North_Korea could well be an even more dangerous North KoreaFor almost two_decades South_Korea and the United_States have discussed contingencies in the event of Kims death and North_Koreas collapse If the Korean_Peninsula were to be unified millions of impoverished North_Koreans could flood the border into the South The cost of unification according to one major study could exceed $1 trillion and last_year President Lee Myung-bak proposed a unification tax not yet put into place to prepare for such a momentThe White_House issued a statement late Sunday acknowledging Kims death The president has been notified and we are in close touch with our allies in South_Korea and Japan We remain committed to stability on the Korean peninsula and to the freedom and security of our alliesSecretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was briefed on the reports of Kims death a department spokesman saidClinton has increased the pressure on the North_Korean government in recent_weeks traveling to Burma last_month in a bid to drive a wedge between Pyongyang and one of its few customers for nuclear technology After the trip there was speculation that she might follow her Burma visit with a trip to the North_Korean capital Clinton also appointed a new US envoy last fall to make a new push for a diplomatic breakthrough on North_Koreas nuclear program Especially in the past two years North_Korea has depended for much of its security on China which supplies Pyongyang with much-needed aid and investment China has also used its influence to block UN measures against North_Korea and US officials have called on China to use its influence to encourage North_Koreas liberalizationAlmost nothing is known about how Kim_Jong Eun if he successfully takes power will run the countryBefore his death Kim_Jong Il had been grooming his third and youngest son as his successor Kim_Jong Eun studied for a time in Switzerland at a German-speaking high school in Liebefeld a suburb of the Swiss capital Bern Former classmates remember a shy but determined boy obsessed with American basketball and expensive sports shoes They say he spoke passable German and made some local friends but was monitored closely by staff members s from the North_Korean Embassy in BernHe vanished in the middle of the school year in 2000 apparently to return to Pyongyang and had not been seen in public since until he emerged at his fathers heir apparent last_year A campaign of hagiographic propaganda hailed him as the Dear Young General but it is unclear how_much support he has

major change is needed to kick-start South_Koreas anemic economy South Koreans have long bristled at the power of the conglomerates known here as chaebol but have been afraid that change would inflict huge economic pain on the countryThat thinking has shifted during the scandal embroiling the president which centers on allegations that the chaebol particularly Samsung paid bribes to win favorable treatment from the government thereby becoming even more powerfulThis shift means that the main point of difference between presidential candidates is foreign_policy and national securityEveryone agrees we need to do something about the chaebol said Shim Jae-hoon a veteran political commentator Its North_Korea that will be the deciding factor and that will clinch the presidency in the next election As did former president Roh rival candidate Moon comes from the progressive camp that favors engagement with Pyongyang as a way to minimize tensions and the economic gap_between the two

a hard-line approach to North_Korea and would never vote for MoonI think that this is the direction that a progressive party needs to take he said referring to his centrist positions on foreign_policy

Im_going to win Yoonjung_Seo contributed to this reportSpecial counsel_Robert S_Mueller III on Monday revealed charges_against three former Trump campaign officials including onetime campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort marking the first criminal allegations to come from probes into possible Russian influence in US political affairsThe charges are striking for their breadth touching all levels of the Trump campaign and exploring possible personal financial wrongdoing by those involved as well as what appeared to be a concerted effort by one campaign official to arrange a meeting with Russian officials One of the three charged former Trump admitted to making a false_statement to FBI investigators who asked about his contacts with foreigners claiming to have high-level Russian connections Manafort and longtime business_partner Rick_Gates meanwhile were charged in a 12-count_indictment with conspiracy to launder money making false_statements and other charges in connection with their work advising a Russia-friendly political party in Ukraine The investigation which the FBI began last_year but escalated significantly with Muellers appointment in May has taken a heavy toll on the Trump administration repeatedly putting the president on the defensive as reports have emerged about the work the special_counsels team is doing With Mondays revelations a week that otherwise might have been spent with Washington focused on the Republican tax plan will have talking heads dissecting the criminal counts against former Trump campaign officials and speculating about the next shoe to drop Papadopouloss plea agreement signed earlier_this month and unsealed_Monday described his extensive efforts to try to broker connections with Russian officials and arrange a meeting between them and the Trump campaign Emails show that his offers were sometimes looked at warily though more-senior campaign officials at_least entertained themManafort and Gates pleaded not guilty in a brief appearance in DC federal court Monday afternoon A federal magistrate judge put the men on home confinement and set a $10 million unsecured bond for Manafort and a $5million unsecured bond for Gates That means the men would be in debt to the government if they failed to show up for court though they do not have to put any money down Both surrendered their passports to the FBI The next hearing in the case was scheduled for Nov 2 before US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson a 2011 President_Barack Obama appointee who previously worked as a federal_prosecutor in the DistrictFor their part Trump his spokeswoman and his lawyer sought to cast the charges as having nothing to do with the president White_House press_secretary Sarah_Huckabee Sanders asserted that Papadopoulos had an extremely limited volunteer role in the campaign and said that no activity was ever done in an official capacity on behalf of the campaign in that regard Ty Cobb a White_House lawyer overseeing the administrations handling of the Mueller probe said The one thing thats clear is theres no reference to collusion no reference to the presidentThe president himself to declare Sorry but this is years_ago before Paul_Manafort was part of the Trump campaign But why arent Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus Also there is NO COLLUSION he said in a follow-up Sanders said that Trump had no intention or plan to make any changes with regard to the special_counsel and Cobb said there had been no talk of possible pardons for Manafort or Gates No no no Thats never come up and wont come up Cobb said in an interviewOutside the DC courthouse Kevin Downing a lawyer for Manafort said President Donald Trump was correct There is no_evidence that Mr Manafort and the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian_government Glenn Selig a Gates spokesman said that Gates welcomes the opportunity to confront these charges in courtThis fight is just beginning Selig said The charges are a major step in the investigation but they do not represent a conclusion Court documents revealed that Papadopoulos for example has been cooperating with investigators for three months having been arrested and charged in July after landing at Dulles International Airport on a flight from Germany The information he provides could be key to furthering Muellers_investigation into others legal_analysts said Papadopoulos admitted that he had lied to the FBI about his interactions with people he thought had connections with the Russian_government essentially understating the conversations and claiming falsely that they had occurred before he joined Trumps campaign In a January 2017 interview with the FBI Papadopoulos told agents that a London-based professor claimed to him that he had dirt on Hillary_Clinton including thousands of emails But Papadopoulos said that initially he viewed the professor as a nothing In reality according to his plea Papadopoulos understood that the professor had connections to Russian_government officials and he treated him seriously An email quoted in court_filings appears to match one in which Papadopoulos identified the professor with whom he met as Joseph Mifsud the director of the London Academy of Diplomacy After a March_2016 meeting with the professor who was not identified in court records Papadopoulos_emailed a campaign supervisor and other members of the campaigns foreign_policy team He claimed that the professor had introduced him to Putins_niece and the Russian_ambassador in London and that the purpose was to arrange a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss US-Russia ties under President Trump court_documents say The government noted that the woman was not Russian President_Vladimir Putins_niece and while Papadopoulos expected the professor to introduce him to the Russian_ambassador that never happened But in the months that followed Papadopoulos continued to correspond with the woman and the professor about a meeting between the Trump campaign possibly including Trump himself and Russian officialsThe Russian_government has an open invitation by Putin for Mr Trump to meet him when he is ready Papadopoulos wrote to a senior policy_adviser for the campaign on April 25At one point a campaign official forwarded one of Papadopouloss emails to another campaign official saying We_need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips It should be someone low_level in the campaign so as not to send any signal DT would appear to be a reference to Donald Trump Papadopouloss effort continued into the summer of 2016 and in August 2016 a campaign supervisor told Papadopoulos and another foreign_policy adviser that they should meet with Russian officials That ultimately did_not take_place according to the pleaAccording to documents and interviews the supervisor was national campaign co-chairman Sam_Clovis whose lawyer said he actually opposed the trip and was just being polite Other officials who received emails from Papadopoulos were campaign_manager Corey_Lewandowski and ManafortLawyers for Papadopoulos said in a statement We will have the opportunity to comment on Georges involvement when called upon by the Court at a later date We look forward to telling all of the details of Georges story at that timeIn a separate indictment the special_counsel alleged that Manafort and Gates laundered money for nearly a decade through scores of US and foreign corporations and accounts and gave false_statements to the Justice_Department and others when asked about their work on behalf of a foreign entity The time period stretched into at_least 2016 though it did_not seem to involve the Trump campaign According to the indictment Manafort and Gates arranged to hire two Washington-based lobbying_firms to work on behalf of their Ukrainian clients arranging meetings with US officials and boosting their public image in the United_States Though it was not named one of the firms referenced in the indictment is the Podesta_Group Tony Podesta the head of the firm The other firm is Mercury Public Affairs according to people_familiar with the matter A partner at Mercury said the firm believed our work was intended to serve an important and proper purposeProsecutors say Manafort and Gates arranged for a Brussels-based nonprofit to nominally hire the Washington companies to hide the fact that the two men were working for Ukrainian government officials otherwise they would have been required to register under the Foreign_Agents Registration ActIn fact prosecutors allege Manafort was communicating directly with then-Ukrainian President Viktor_Yanukovych about the effort promising in 2012 to provide him weekly updates Prosecutors say that when the Justice_Department approached Manafort and Gates in 2016 and 2017 about whether they should have registered as foreign agents for the work they responded with false and misleading letters according to the indictmentManafort and Gates also were accused of trying to hide money kept in foreign_bank accounts Manafort from 2011 to 2014 and Gates from 2012 to 2014 And Manafort was accused of filing fraudulent tax_returns stating on tax forms he filed from 2008 to 2014 that he controlled no foreign_bank accountsAll told more_than $75 million flowed through offshore_accounts the special_counsel alleged From 2008 to 2014 according to the indictment Manafort arranged to wire $12 million from offshore_accounts to pay for personal expenses including $5 million to a home renovation contractor in the Hamptons more_than $13 million to a home entertainment and lighting vendor based in Florida $934000 to an antique-rug dealer in Alexandria and $849000 to a mens clothier in New YorkLaw

dossiers allegationsSimpson initially said through his lawyer that he would invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if forced to appear But on Tuesday he agreed to a transcribed interview behind closed doors Grassley and Feinstein said A lawyer for Simpson Joshua Levy declined to commentSimpson and Manafort were initially slated to appear on the same panel along with Trump Jr at Wednesdays hearing where lawmakers were expected to ask the Trump surrogates about the June_2016 Trump_Tower meetingEmails sent to Trump Jr before the meeting show he agreed to meet with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya after being told she was a Russian_government lawyer bearing damaging_information about Trumps opponent Hillary_Clinton that was being shared as part of a Russian_government effort to help his fathers campaignManaforts notes could provide information about what exactly was said at the meeting and how participants responded Manafort who was a top adviser at the time of the meeting was named campaign_chairman days laterIn an initial statement as the New_York Times prepared to report that the meeting had taken place Trump Jr had said it was primarily about the issue of the adoption of Russian children by US families The Russian_government halted such adoptions in retaliation for a US law passed in 2012 that blacklisted top Russian officials over alleged human_rights abusesLater Trump Jr acknowledged that Veselnitskaya had first described information she believed could be damaging to Democrats but has called that information vague and ambiguous Rinat Akhmetshin a Russian American lobbyist who also attended the meeting has said that Veselnitskaya left behind documents describing the informationManaforts notes could shed more light on the information she provided and what_happened to the documents she brought to the session Tom Hamburger and Ellen_Nakashima contributed to this reportRepublican presidential contender Donald Trump on Monday providedfive names onhis foreign_policy team after months of speculation over who could be advising the businessman front-runner Heres what we know so_far about the advisers named byTrump in a meeting with The Washington PostSchmitz served asinspector general at the Department of Defense during the George_W Bush administrationA Los Angeles Times in 2005 revealed a number of issues with Schmitzs termthereSchmitz slowed or blocked investigations of senior Bush administration officials spent taxpayer money on pet projects and accepted gifts that may have violated ethics guidelines according to interviews with current and former senior officials in the inspector generals office congressional investigators and a review of internal email and other documentsSchmitz also drew scrutiny for his unusual fascination with Baron Friedrich Von Steuben a Revolutionary War hero who is considered the militarys first true inspector general Schmitz even replaced the official inspector generals seal in offices nationwide with a new one bearing the Von Steuben family motto according to the documents and interviewsHe later a senior official at the Prince Group the parent company of defense contractor Blackwater In in The Washington_Post covering the move DanielleBrian executive director of the Project on Government Oversight said The inspector general is a standard-bearer for ethics and integrity for the Pentagon To see a person who has been holding that position cash in on his public service and go work for one of their contractors is tremendously disappointing In a brief phone_call Monday Schmitz confirmed that he is working for theTrump campaign and said that he has been involved for the past month He said he frequently confers with Sam_Clovis one of Trumps top policy advisers and that there has been a series of conference calls and briefings in recent weeksAccording to his LinkedIn profile Schmitz attended the US Naval Academy and Stanford Law School and has worked in recent years for two small law firms bearing his name His father is the lateformer Republican congressman John G Schmitz who was also a member of the right-wing John Birch Society One of

people in energy policy circles in London Washington and New_York said they knew nothing of himAlmostall his workappears to have revolved around the role of Greece Cyprus and an Israeli natural_gas discovery in the eastern Mediterranean YetJonathan Sterndirector of gas research at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said when asked about PapadopoulosHe does ring a very faint bell but hes not written anything very significant on East Mediterranean natural_gas and pipelines that I can rememberIndeed Papadopoulos has not left much of a paper trail He has written an oped piece in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz and three articles for Arutz Sheva an Israeli news site He has given an interview on another Web siteHis points in all of them boil down to this Israel should use the natural_gas it has found in the giant Leviathan field offshore in the eastern Mediterranean to build bridges to Greece and Cyprus and avoid dealing with Turkey at all costs Any extra gas could be sent to Egypt which Papadopoulos said already has liquefied natural_gas plants for importing gasHe also Israel to settle antitrust issues regarding its oil and gas industry by providing the regulatory certainty so that relatively large companies can exploit the natural_gas soonPapadopoulos who bears the same name as the Greek colonel who led a 1967 coup has also written the United_States should station a fleet of warships in Crete and that Cyprus should join NATOShipping the natural_gas to Turkey by pipeline and from there to the rest of Europe might be relatively inexpensive Papadopoulos has written but he said Israel should look elsewhere The Turkish option he in March 2014 is bereft of the political realities in the region and does_not take into account the potentially devastating impact this option can have on Israels strategic relations with EU member Cyprus and by extension all of Europe He writes Regional economic cooperation between Israel and Cyprus should be the guiding principle that anchors Israel economically to EuropeIn October 2015 he in Haaretz that Israels energy exports can serve as the basis for enhancing strategic relations between Israel and Egypt They could also serve as the foundation for political and security cooperation with Greece and CyprusElizabeth Rosenberg an energy expert_at the Center for a New American Security said judging from the limited writing Papadopoulos has done that his approach wont square well with an American audience he lacks a strongcontemporary backgroundon domesticenergy issues She added that he has argued forIsraeli gas moving to Europe If that eventually comes to pass it willcompete with US gas to EuropeThe United_States andIsrael are allies butwhose team is he onPapadopoulos also wrote in January 2014 that Israel and Greeces robust military relations have redrawn the political map of the region The US would be wise to shift its policies and resources towards improving relations at all levels with its stalwart allies in the region Israel Greece and Cyprus to contain the newly emergent Russian fleet and malignant jihadist forces operating around Israels bordersEarier Papadopoulos wrote about terrorism for The Chicago Examiner and as an intern at the Jamestown Foundation In 2011 he wrote As history has explained to its readers the ancient Greek mythological hero Hercules fought the mythical hydra which

todays predicamentMichael Flynn the national_security adviser to President Trump resigned late Monday over revelations about his to the United_States and his misleading statements about the matter to senior Trump administration officialsFlynn stepped down amid mounting pressure on the Trump administration to account for its false_statements about Flynns conduct after The Washington_Post reported Monday that the Justice_Department had warned the White_House last_month that Flynn had so mischaracterized his communications with the Russian diplomat that he might be vulnerable to blackmail by Moscow In his Flynn said he had inadvertently briefed the Vice_President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian_ambassador I have sincerely apologized to the president and the vice presidentFlynn was referring to his disproven claims to Vice_President Pence and others a month ago that he had never discussed US sanctions against Moscow with Russian_Ambassador Sergey_Kislyak Pence White_House spokesman Sean_Spicer and others relying on Flynns accounts publicly defended him and repeatedly declared in categorical terms that sanctions were never discussedPresident Trump accepted Flynns resignation letter and appointed Keith Kellogg a decorated retired Army lieutenant general as acting national_security adviserFlynns resignation after just 24 days on the job caps a decorated career in public service for the retired lieutenant general and intelligence officialKellogg is one of three candidates Trump is considering as a permanent replacement for Flynn according to a senior White_House official The other two are David H Petraeus a former CIA_director and retired general and a former deputy commander of the US Central CommandOne senior White_House official said that Trump did_not fire Flynn rather Flynn made the decision to resign on his own late Monday evening because of what this official said was the cumulative effect of damaging news coverage about his conversations with the Russian envoy This official who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the situation said Trump does_not relish firing people despite his television persona on The Apprentice and had intended to wait several more days before deciding whether to seek Flynns resignationThere obviously were a lot of issues but the president was hanging in there this official said Flynns departure just weeks into the Trump administration compounds the confusion in the National Security_Council that is supposed to serve as a disciplined coordination center for the administrations handling of international affairsInstead the White_House faces an escalating court fight over an immigration ban aimed_at Muslim-majority countries has alienated key allies with Trumps brusque phone calls to foreign leaders and seemed so caught off-guard by North_Koreas that Trump and senior officials were shown in full view of patrons at Trumps Mar-a Lago resort Flynn was forced out less_than a week after it was disclosed that he had discussed US sanctions against Russia with that countrys ambassador before Trump was sworn in as presidentBut Flynns undoing was more directly tied to his inaccurate accounts of those contacts to senior Trump officials including Pence who officials said was incensed to learn that Flynn has not told him the truth Flynn again denied that he had discussed the subject in an interview with The Washington_Post last_week only to back away from that statement a day later by acknowledging through a spokesman that while he couldnt recall speaking about sanctions he could not rule it outIn fact US intelligence and law_enforcement officials have said that sanctions were a main subject of Flynns conversation with Kislyak on the day that the Obama_administration announced a series of punitive measures aimed_at punishing Moscow for its meddling in the 2016 US presidential electionUS officials said that Flynn told Kislyak that Moscow should not overreact to the sanctions indicating that the two sides would soon be in position to revisit the matter presumably in Moscows favorIn conveying that message Flynn may have broken a law against unauthorized individuals negotiating with foreign governments over conflicts He is unlikely to face legal sanction however because that law dates to 1799 and has never been used in a prosecutionBut Flynns departure is unlikely to end the trouble the issue has created for the Trump administration The_Post reported Monday that then-acting US attorney_general Sally Q Yates told the White_House counsel last_month that Flynns misleading statements to Pence and others whose own government would have known that sanctions were discussedThe White_House appears to have let its repeated false_statements about Flynn stand for weeks after that notification from Yates and has yet to account for what it did with the warning she conveyed The disclosures about Flynn have added to the swirling suspicion about the Trump administrations relationship with Moscow suspicion based in part on Trumps repeated expressions of Flynns resignation appears to end the career of a highly decorated US military intelligence_officer who served repeated tours in Afghanistan and Iraq but became a polarizing figure in last years presidential campaignIn a speech at the Republican National_Convention Flynn led vitriolic attacks on Democratic nominee Hillary_Clinton leading chants of Lock_her up and declaring that if he had been even partly as careless as she was in her handling of sensitive material by email he would be in jail Flynn spent last weekend at Mar-a-Lago with Trump staffing the president during his visit with Japanese_Prime Minister_Shinzo Abe Back at the White_House on Monday Flynn attended classified briefings helped orchestrate the visit of Canadian Prime_Minister Justin Trudeau and led Trumps morning intelligence briefing this official saidSome of Trumps political advisers felt Flynn should not be fired in the midst of intense media scrutiny and calls for his resignation from Democratic opponentsPart of me said nobody should be firing this guy not on the day that Nancy_Pelosi said fire this guy the official said But by Monday evening Flynn had decided he could not surviveIt was when you feel like youre looking around the room and asking Wheres my friend the White_House official said The Pence thing was huge He is not somebody whos quick to anger That was very telling to everybodyFlynn presented his resignation letter to Trump roughly around 9 pm shortly_after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchins swearing-in ceremony in the Oval_Office Trump accepted the letterIt was a sad moment the White_House official saidIt took Stephen Colbert and Joe Scarborough all of two minutes to get to Kellyanne_Conway and the L-wordScarborough was a guest Tuesday night on Colberts Late_Show and he seemed eager to explain the decision to last weekIt got to a point where Kellyanne would keep coming out and everything she said was disproven like five minutes later Scarborough said And it wasnt disproven by a fact-checker it was somebody else in the administration that would come out and actually say well actually no thats not trueTheres a quicker way to say that entire sentence Colbert replied She just liedScarborough a former Republican congressman from Florida is the host of Morning Joe Co-host Mika Brzezinski said earlier_this month that Conway tries to book herself on the show but I wont do it cause I dont believe in fake_news or information that is not true Every time Ive seen her on television somethings askew off or incorrect Conway was the person who ushered the phrase alternative facts into the popular American lexicon It was January on Meet the Press and host Chuck Todd was pressing her on why the White_House press_secretary made easily disproved claims about the size of Trumps inauguration crowdConway told Todd that White_House press_secretary Sean_Spicer had alternative factsAlternative facts are not facts Todd responded Theyre falsehoodsThe statement and Conways credibility took a hitTim OBrien (@obrienillustration Instagram) has created perhaps the ultimate visual on Andy Revkin (@Revkin) It got worse a few days later when Conwayused the Bowling_Green massacre in justifying Trumps travel_ban saying most people dont_know about it because it didnt get coveredIt also didnt happen There has by terrorists or anyone elseConway said shed misspoken but The Washington Posts Aaron Blake reported that On I meant to say Bowling_Green terrorists as reported here Kellyanne_Conway (@KellyannePolls) As The Posts the Morning Joe hosts have characterized Conway as an attention seeker who texts TV producers in a constant effort to get on air so she can speak for a White_House where she actually isnt in the knowBorchers wrote that the morning show hosts described Conway as pretty much like her caricature on Saturday Night LiveScarborough also used his time on the show to talk about Conways boss the president who they think based on his Twitter feed is an avid watcher Hes watched the show for years kind of goes in waves Well always look in the camera and say Donald we know youre not watching the show but how you doingColbert pushed back jesting about calling Trump Donald instead of Mr PresidentThe way hes acted over the past month has made it even harder to call him Mr President Scarborough repliedSince Trump took_office Colberts show has gotten more political a topical shift toward more timely material orchestrated by Chris Lichts takeover backstage In early February Colberts The Late_Show beat out Jimmy Fallons The Tonight Show for the first time since Colbert replaced David Letterman in September 2015And Colbert has kept pouring it on Last week he He has made fun of Trump calling the media and he hasA little-noticed court filing unsealed this week as part of special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_IIIs ongoing probe could have big consequences for his other targets showing hes willing to use suspects lawyers to provide evidence against themAfter unsealing a 12-count_indictment against Paul_Manafort the US District Court also unsealed an opinion from Chief Judge Beryl A Howell saying one of Manaforts former lawyers could be compelled to testify to the grand juryTypically such information is protected by attorney-client privilege a bedrock principle of US legal practice that says a lawyer must keep confidential what they are told by their clientsThere are some exceptions to that confidentiality including in instances where a suspect may have lied to his or her lawyer causing that lawyer to unwittingly lie to the government Howell ruled that in Manaforts case the exception applied and the attorney could be called to testify before the grand juryThe opinion is troubling because people make representations to the government all the time through their lawyers and I_think theres a general expectation of confidentiality behind the conversations that go into those representations said Peter D Hardy a partner at the Ballard Spahr law_firm Its widening a door thats not often used And the wider the door gets maybe the more people will use it Hardy said the use of what lawyers call the crime-fraud exception indicates the special_counsel team is highly intelligent highly aggressive and theyre going to pursue legal theories that your average prosecutor will not use Will they use the specific theory again Its certainly possibleManafort is hardly the only person under_scrutiny who used lawyers to make government filings One of Muellers other key targets Michael_Flynn has also filed government papers regarding his work on behalf of another governmentNo public charges have been filed against Flynn former national_security adviser in the Trump administration but he remains under investigation according to officials familiar with the matter who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigationIn the Manafort case the judge began her ruling by declaring This is a matter of national importance The ruling does_not identify Manaforts lawyer it refers to the attorney simply as the Witness but people_familiar with the case said it was Melissa Laurenza who was willing to testify if her clients consented which they did_not Neither Laurenza nor her lawyer responded to a request for comment TuesdayA Manafort spokesman also declined to commentAfter several hearings on the subject the judge decided prosecutors could ask the lawyer seven out of eight proposed questions ruling one went too far The judge said investigators had gathered enough evidence from other sources to justify questioning the lawyer though the details of that evidence were redacted from the court filingThat legal fight took_place under seal in September but the opinion was unsealed_Monday the same day charges were announced against Manafort and his deputy_Rick GatesProsecutors also revealed Monday that a had pleaded_guilty and been cooperating with investigators for monthsIn Manaforts case prosecutors used information from his former lawyer to charge him with lying to the government about his work for a foreign government Ukraine While most of the indictment focuses on issues of alleged money_laundering conspiracy and failure to file reports to tax authorities the last two counts of the indictment say that Manafort and Gates knowingly and willfully caused to be made a false_statement in a government filing required under the Foreign_Agents Registration_Act or FARA Court filings suggest those two charges stem in part from information provided by Manaforts former lawyerIn the FARA filing Manafort and Gates denied that their work on the part of Ukraines Party of Regions constituted lobbying on behalf of a foreign governmentJacob Frenkel a white-collar attorney at Dickinson Wright who previously worked in the Office of the Independent Counsel said Howells ruling was likely a critical one for prosecutors who otherwise would need to jump over and avoid altogether the communications with counselIt is invaluable to the FARA counts and to the issue of Manaforts state of mind more broadly in the indictment because an experienced credible lawyer is going to have instant credibility with a jury Frenkel saidFrenkel said that the ruling was written in such a way that Howell seemed to believe it would be appealedThe attorneys testimony will be central to an actual case if this case ever gets there Frenkel saidWith the guilty plea of one Trump campaign official and a 31-page indictment of two others special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III spoke volumes more about the Russia probe than months of heated public debate Without uttering a word Muellers message was clear according to veteran lawyers He isnt bluffing and witnesses are talkingThe double-barreled court_filings ratchet up the pressure on everyone under_scrutiny in the investigation lawyers said in part because they show that a former Trump campaign adviser began cooperating with the FBI three months_ago This is the way you kick off a big case said Patrick Cotter a white-collar defense lawyer in Chicago who once worked as a federal_prosecutor in New_York alongside Andrew Weissmann who is spearheading the prosecution of former Trump campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort and his deputy_Rick Gates Prosecutors also announced a guilty plea from former campaign adviser_George Papadopoulos about his interactions with people linked to the Russian_government Papadopoulos has who questioned him about those contacts according to court recordsOh man they couldnt have sent a message any clearer if theyd rented a revolving neon sign in Times Square Cotter said And the message isnt just about Manafort Its a message to the next five guys they talk to And the message is We are coming and we are not playing and we are not bluffingThe special_counsel also appears to be moving fastWhite-collar cases often begin by flipping bit players far down the chain of command The prosecution team that sent WorldCom chief_executive Bernie Ebbers to prison for decades began with charges_against a low-level accountant Prosecutors then worked their way up the corporate ladder flipping senior managers until they had a case against EbbersAnd as Mueller probes whether Trump associates conspired with Russian_government actors to influence the 2016_presidential election he already has a cooperator at the lower rungs of the campaign Papadopoulos The prosecutors court_filings say that Papadopoulos sought to arrange a meeting between officials with the Trump campaign and the Russian_government and talked to people connected to the Russian_government about providing dirt on Democratic candidate Hillary ClintonPeter Zeidenberg a former federal_prosecutor with expertise in national_security called the Papadopoulos plea a big deal because it goes much closer to the issue of collusionThe fact that hes been cooperating for three months is important too he said Who else is cooperating that we dont_know about Thats what people in the White_House need to be worried aboutWhile the Papadopoulos court_filings offer more links_between Trump associates and Russian figures they do not define the extent to which senior campaign officials supported that effortIts not a direct connection as yet said Daniel E Toomey a former prosecutor in Washington There are additional bread crumbs that are missing leading to the White HouseToomey called the indictment of Manafort and Gates extraordinarily intricate and said it will put enormous pressure on the defendants to cooperate This becomes a paper case The documents speak for themselves he said This case by my estimation will take months to try The cost of the litigation for Manafort will be in the millions of dollars Veteran lawyers described the indictment as daunting alleging $18 million worth of money_laundering which prosecutors said in court could mean more_than a dozen years in prisonThe indictment even seems to go out of its way to kneecap a standard defense argument in such cases that the defendant got bad advice from his accountant The indictment charges that Manafort wrote specifically to his accountant that he did_not have foreign_bank accounts Nick Akerman a former assistant special Watergate prosecutor said the court_filings all spell bad news for President TrumpAkerman said he could not see any defense to the Manafort indictmentHe has no choice but to plead guilty Thats what the indictment says to me he said The only defense that youve got is to go in there and start singing like a canary to avoid jail time And once he starts singing one of the tunes is bound to be Donald Trump But Jay Nanavati a former Justice_Department tax prosecutor said the filing of the indictment shows that so_far prosecutors have not been able to convince Manafort to cooperate but this is still how you start moving up the ladder in any organizationWhats striking about the indictment Nanavati said is the number of people who worked for Manafort accountants lawyers and others who provided key evidence against him That could be an ominous warning for other subjects of the probe like former national_security adviser_Michael Flynn who used lawyers to make official statements to the government that have now come into question And unidentified lobbying_firms indirectly hired by Manafort he said are in significant trouble because of the written exchanges referenced in the indictment alleging that some people at the firms were aware that Manafort was lying about their work togetherNanavati said a key change in US tax enforcement that began in 2008 going after foreign_bank accounts controlled by Americans probably played an important role in the case against Manafort Before the Justice_Department started cracking through the layers of Swiss banking secrecy that hid Americans accounts in 2008 he said the requirement on Americans to declare foreign_bank accounts was on the books but basically nobody ever did it and almost no one ever got prosecuted for it That changed in 2008 and tax return preparers started asking With the decline of bank secrecy Nanavati said crimes such as tax evasion and money_laundering through foreign accounts became harder to hide and made the charges_against Manafort easier to bringA key leader of the tax enforcement effort was then-Justice Department lawyer Kevin DowningDowning is now Manaforts defense lawyer Outside court on Monday he blasted the governments indictment for claiming his client committed crimes via foreign_bank accounts To claim that maintaining such accounts to bring all your funds into the United_States as a scheme to conceal from the United_States government is ridiculous Downing saidTaking off his glasses and affecting a somber tone Stephen Colbert encouraged his viewers to never fjorget the people who didnt die in a Swedish terrorist attack that never happenedThen a video montage flashed images of the Swedes who were not lost Swedish Fish Ikea the pop group Abba even the Muppet known as Colbert went on the air with new material on Presidents Day and the Late_Show host had some low-hanging fruit to work withAt a Florida rally on Saturday President Trump mentioned several countries that had been attacked by terrorists after taking in refugeesWeve got to keep our country safe he said You look at whats_happening in Germany You look at whats_happening last night in Sweden Sweden who would believe thisThe answer according to Colbert No one would believe that but maybe someone who skips their intelligence briefingsTrump later said his statements were in response to something hed seen on Fox NewsMy statement as to whats_happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on concerning immigrants & Sweden Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) In_addition to being simply inaccurate Saturdays statements about Sweden were the third time Trump or people in his administration had tried to make a policy point by talking_about an attack by foreign terrorists that didnt in fact happenTragically Sweden is the third not-a-terrorist attack that hasnot shocked the world in the last_month Colbert said First there wasnt the Bowling_Green massacre then no one was lost in Atlanta And now its not Swedens turn When will it begin Earlier this month White_House counselor Kellyanne_Conway defended Trumps travel_ban Most people dont_know that because it didnt get covered Conway told MSNBCs Chris MatthewsBut there has never been a terrorist attack in Bowling_Green KyWhite House_press secretary in defending the ban Later he clarified saying he meant OrlandoColbert was hardly the only one who took a swing at Trump after Saturdays statementSeth Meyers hammered the president on Late NightAnd former Swedish prime_minister Carl Bildt who has written about Trumps presidency in a serious tone wondered What has he been smokingSweden Terror attack What has he been smoking Questions abound Carl Bildt (@carlbildt) Bildt of Colberts Trump takeSweden has seenrecent immigration-related tension just not the issues Trump spoke ofPolice in Sweden say that Monday_night a riot broke out in a predominantly immigrant suburb after police arrested a suspect on drug charges During the arrest people started throwing stones at police and the situation escalatedLater unidentified people set cars on fires and looted shops In total police were investigating a case of vandalism and aggravated thefts three incidents of violent rioting and three assaults including one against a police officerPreet Bharara one of the most high-profile federal_prosecutors in the country said he was fired Saturday after refusing to submit a letter of resignation as part of an ouster of the remaining US attorneys who were holdovers from the Obama_administration according to people_familiar with the matterBhararas dismissal was an about-face from President Trumps assurances to the Manhattan-based prosecutor in November weeks after the election that he wanted him to stay on the job following a meeting at Trump_Tower according to BhararaTwo people close to Trump said the presidents chief_strategist Stephen_K Bannon and Attorney_General Jeff_Sessions wanted a clean slate of federal_prosecutors and were unconcerned about any perception that the White_House changed its mind about Bharara The removal of former president Barack_Obamas federal_prosecutors is about asserting whos in power the two saidThe departure of Bharara the US attorney for the Southern_District of New_York capped a confusing sequence of events beginning Friday when acting deputy attorney_general Dana Boente began making calls to 46 prosecutors asking for their resignations by the end of the day Requests for resignation are a normal part of a transition of power from one administration to another although both the Bush and Obama administrations let their US attorneys leave gradually During Fridays call with Bharara the New_York prosecutor asked for clarity about whether the requests for resignations applied to him given his previous conversation with Trump and did_not immediately get a definitive answer according to a person_familiar with the exchangeWhen asked Friday whether Bharara was also being asked for a resignation letter one White_House official not authorized to speak publicly said Everybodys gone and would not engage further on the issueOn Saturday morning when the administration had still not received Bhararas resignation Boente attempted to call the US attorney to find out why but the two men did_not immediately connect according to people_familiar with the discussionsWhen they finally did speak shortly before 230 pm Boente informed Bharara that the order to submit his resignation indeed applied to him because he was a presidentially appointed US attorney according to a Justice_Department official with knowledge of the conversationBharara asked Boente if he was firing him and Boente replied that he was asking him to submit his resignation the official saidMinutes later Bharara announced on Twitter that he was out I did_not resign Bharara said Moments ago I was fired Being the US Attorney in SDNY will forever be the greatest honor of my professional lifeBharara sent an email to his staff asserting again that Boente had removed him from his jobNeedless to say it is personally very sad for me the note said This is the greatest place on Earth and I love you all Even on a day when your US Attorney gets fired it is still Thanksgiving because you all still get to do the most honorable work there is to doBharara added that the office could not be in better hands than with the deputy US attorney for the Southern_District of New_York Joon H Kim whom he called a tremendous leader and public servant and who loves the office just as much as I doWithin the Justice_Department some are questioning whether a recent phone_call from Trump to Bharara may have contributed to the decision to remove the Obama holdovers according to a person_familiar with the matterOn Thursday a White_House aide called and left a message for Bharara saying the president wanted to speak with him though the prospective topic of discussion was unclear Bharara consulted his staff and determined that it would probably be a violation of Justice_Department protocols for him to speak directly to the president this person said That protocol exists in order to prevent political interference or the appearance of political interference with Justice_Department workBharara then contacted the chief of staff for the attorney_general Jody Hunt told him of his own determination and the two agreed that it would be a violation of the Justice_Department protocol for Bharara to call the president back Bharara then called the White_House staffer who had left the message and said he wouldnt be talking to the president and explained why this person said Its unclear_whether the Trump call and its aftermath had anything to do with Fridays decision Bharara who was born in India and came to the United_States as a child had a particularly powerful perch in the criminal justice system The Southern_District of New_York has 220 assistant US attorneys making it one of the largest federal_prosecutors offices in the countryDuring his tenure Bharara indicted 17 prominent New_York politicians for malfeasance 10of them Democrats Along with his bipartisan prosecutions Bharara developed a reputation for being tough on insider trading although he was criticized for the lack of prosecutions that followed the financial crisisBharara was an outspoken man in a job that has been held by vocal and politically aspirant predecessors including former New_York mayor Rudolph W Giuliani and FBI Director_James B ComeyThere is no indication that the ouster of Bharara stems from a disagreement about a particular case or investigation While the FBI has been conducting a counterintelligence inquiry looking for evidence of contacts between agents of the Russian_government and Trump campaign advisers and a former campaign adviser to Trump has been part of an investigation_into possible overseas corruption there have been no signs that Bhararas office has been involved in either of those probes or any other inquiries that might touch on the president or people close to him On Wednesday watchdog groups Bharara to probe whether Trump has received payments or other benefits from foreign governments through his business_interests in violation of the Constitutions emoluments_clause which prohibits top officials from receiving favors or payments from foreign governmentsThe president complained on Twitter earlier_this month that Obama had ordered wiretapping of Trump_Tower during the election season an accusation that multiple federal law_enforcement officials have said is untrue partly because presidents cannot order the FBI to wiretap Americans and also because no such surveillance was undertaken But Bharara was not drawn into that debate which principally revolved around the Justice_Department and FBI headquartersInitially after Trump won the presidency it looked as if Bhararas position was safe Trump brought up Bhararas name in November during a phone conversation with Sen Charles E Schumer (D-NY) whom the president-elect was calling to congratulate on becoming the leader of the Senate Democrats according to people_familiar with the matter In that conversation Trump said he was thinking of keeping Bharara in his job these people said Schumer praised Bharara and Trump then arranged a meeting with Bharara at Trump TowerDuring the conversation Trump told Bharara to call Sessions his nominee for attorney_general who also asked Bharara to stay people_familiar with the conversation saidWhen Bharara was leaving according to one person he asked the president-elect what he should tell the reporters in the lobby Trump told Bharara to tell them he was staying on this person saidBharara told_reporters afterward that the president-elect presumably because hes a New_Yorker and is aware of the great work that our office has done over the past seven years asked to meet with him and discuss whether he would remain in his positionWe had a good meeting Bharara said I agreed to stay on Matt Zapotosky Rosalind S Helderman Cleve R Wootson Jr Amy B Wang and Ellen_Nakashima contributed to this reportA newly disclosed email sent on the morning of a Trump_Tower meeting held during last years presidential campaign between Donald Trump Jr and a Russian lawyer raises new questions about how the key session came togetherThe note was written by the Russian lawyer and sent to a music promoter who had helped arrange the sessionIt could offer evidence backing up the Russian lawyers claims that she was meeting with Trump Jr solely to discuss a 2012 law despised by the Kremlin that imposed financial sanctions on wealthy Russians as punishment for human_rights abusesThat is the version of events the lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya has asserted in media interviews since the New_York Times first disclosed the Trump_Tower meeting in JulyBut her version conflicts with explosive correspondence released previously that shows the music promoter told Trump Jr before the meeting that Veselnitskaya would bring damaging_information about Hillary_Clinton on behalf of the Russian_government to help the Trump campaignThe newly disclosed email was provided to The Washington_Post by Scott Balber a US lawyer representing Aras Agalarov the Russian billionaire who hosted the Trump-owned Miss_Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013 and who had helped secure the Trump_Tower meeting for VeselnitskayaBalber said he was releasing the email from Veselnitskaya because he thinks it bolsters his clients claim that the Trump_Tower meeting was not part of a Russian_government effort to assist President Trumps campaign despite what music publicist Rob Goldstone had writtenThe newly disclosed email shows Veselnitskaya wrote Goldstone on the morning of the scheduled meeting to ask whether she could bring a lobbyist and trusted associateThe lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin is working to advance these issues with several congressmen she continued He has invaluable knowledge about the positions held by the members of the Foreign_Relations Committee that will be important to our discussionAt the time Veselnitskaya was preparing to testify before the congressional committee about the law the Magnitsky ActThe email offers no conclusive evidence about why Trump Jr accepted the meeting with Russians as his father prepared to accept the Republican nomination for president Trump Jr had reacted enthusiastically when told over email by Goldstone that Agalarov had met with a top prosecutor in Russia and been provided incriminating information about Clinton that the Russian lawyer would conveyIf its what you say I love it Trump Jr wroteBalbers clients also include Agalarovs pop star son Emin who is represented by Goldstone and asked Goldstone to set_up a meeting He also represents Ike Kaveladze a US-based employee of the Agalarovs Agalarov denies that he met with a Russian prosecutor about the US presidential campaign as Goldstone wroteBalber said Veselnitskaya provided him with the email during an interview in Moscow last_month which he conducted to better understand how the Trump_Tower meeting came together by speaking to the person who had first requested itMy clients have been implicated in my view unfairly in some theory that they were involved in an effort to influence the election campaign by providing some secret damaging_information about Hillary_Clinton he said The documents he said are consistent with what my clients have saidVeselnitskaya did_not respond to a request for commentBalber said Veselnitskaya also provided him a detailed account of how she secured the meetingHer account began when she was extended an offer to testify at a June 14 2016 congressional hearing about the Magnitsky Act by US Rep Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif) an advocate of closer ties with Russia The_Post has reported that her testimony was ultimately scuttled after opposition from Foreign_Affairs Committee_Chairman Edward R Royce (R-Calif)Veselnitskaya has said she was interested in the Magnitsky Act issue on behalf of a private client She was working closely in the United_States with Akhmetshin a Russian American lobbyist who has been accused of having ties to Russian intelligence He has denied ties to the Russian governmentVeselnitskaya told Balber that she met with a series of well-connected Russians in early June_2016 to discuss her upcoming trip to the United_States One person with whom she met was Agalarov for whom she had previously done legal workVeselnitskaya told Balber she did_not seek a meeting with the Trump campaign but was surprised and pleased when Agalarov explained his business connection to the presidential_candidate and offered to make a connection Veselnitskaya told Agalarov that she had in October 2015 provided information intended to undermine the US law to Yuri Chaika the Russian prosecutor general Balber said Balber said he believes it is possible Veselnitskayas statement resulted in a misunderstanding about the prosecutors roleRobert Gage an attorney for Goldstone declined to commentBy June 7 2016 Goldstone had confirmed that Veselnitskaya and her translator were confirmed to meet with the candidates son along with top campaign aide Paul_Manafort and Trumps son-in-law Jared_Kushner Two days later Veselnitskaya sent the email asking if she could bring AkhmetshinAkhmetshin has previously told The_Post that he was invited to the meeting at the last minute after having lunch in New_York City with Veselnitskaya where she asked his advice on what to say The newly released email shows Veselnitskaya asked Goldstone if the lobbyist could attend at 924 am not after lunch and that she wrote she had a signed a nondisclosure agreement with AkhmetshinMichael Tremonte a lawyer for Akhmetshin said that the lobbyist was invited to the meeting over lunchHe has no recollection of signing a nondisclosure agreement in connection with the meeting and was not

gardensThe coastline is a few_minutes walk from the door with a private trail that leads down to the beachNorth Korea has announced its first five-year plan since the 1980s with leader Kim_Jong Un issuing instructions for developing the Korean revolution on a higher stageThe prominence put on the economy at the first to be held in 36 years underscores the emphasis that Kim the third-generation leader of North_Korea has placed on improving living standards and at the same_time pursuing nuclear_weapons But it is something of a risky move for Kim because he could be held accountable for itAlso at the congress which got underway Friday Kim said North_Korea would not use its nuclear_weapons unless its sovereignty was violated a familiar refrain from Pyongyang which presents its nuclear and missile program as necessary for self-defense Kim has lauded North_Koreas advances in nuclear technology as South_Korean officials continue to warn that a fifth test could be imminentThe surprisingly full remarks from Kim were reported on North_Koreas state television and in the official media Sunday Foreign journalists allowed to travel to Pyongyang for the congress have not been given any access to the forum apart from being taken to a street corner across from the venueThe agenda for the congress includes a review of the partys work and rules the election of Kim to the top position in the party and the filling of other senior positions according to the Norths official Korean_Central News AgencyAnalysts seized on the news that Kim has announced a plan for developing which remains in dire shape despite growing modestly in the past few years International sanctions_imposed this year after nuclear and ballistic_missile tests are expected to create additional challenges Michael Madden who runs the site said the plan is a big deal because Kim is taking public responsibility for economic_development something his father never didIt has appeared that Kim has been trying to rule like his grandfather Kim_Il Sung who placed more importance on the Workers_Party than on the military His father and predecessor Kim_Jong Il promoted a military first policyThe announcement of a five-year economic plan slightly proves the hypothesis that Kim_Jong Un is ruling like his grandfather he even appropriated a Kim_Il Sung policy direction here with more formal lines of control and authority like a five-year economic plan Madden saidIn an address at the congress Kim announced a five-year strategy for the state economic_development from 2016 to 2020 Such plans are commonplace in communist systems but North_Korea hasnt produced one since the 1980sKim said that the period since the last Workers_Party congress was an unprecedentedly grim struggle in North_Koreas long history Over the next five_years North_Korea should fly the flag of victory and become a scientific and technological economic and highly civilized power Kim saidIt is imperative to carry through the five-year strategy for the state economic_development from 2016 to 2020 Kim reportedly told the congress It is necessary to further increase the might of the politico-ideological power and military powerAlthough there were few other details analysts said it was remarkable that Kim had spoken publicly about his plans for economic growth His father who died in 2011 and presided over a period of economic devastation and widespread famine did_not utter public statements that he could be held accountable forBut Kim_Jong Un has been promoting a byungjin or simultaneous pursuit policy under which he has been trying to grow the economy and develop nuclear_weapons and ballistic_missiles to deliver them The Souths Bank of Korea estimates that the Norths economy has been growing at about 1 or 2percent a year but Andrei Lankov a North_Korea specialist at Kookmin University in Seoul agrees with other analysts who think that its growth has been much higher potentially as high as the 7percent estimate from the Hyundai Economic Research Institute in SeoulRecent events also prove that North_Korea is making technical advances on its weapons_program North_Korean scientists would have learned more about their technical abilities and shortcomings during the nuclear_test in January and a long-range rocket launch in February They would also have learned from their more Jeffrey_Lewis an arms control expert_at the Center for Nonproliferation_Studies in California has saidDuring the congress Kim repeated the line that North_Korea would not go on the offensive with its weaponsAs a responsible nuclear_weapons state our republic will not use a nuclear_weapon unless its sovereignty is encroached upon by any aggressive hostile forces with nukes Kim told the meeting according to KCNAPlans to deploy an American antimissile_battery to South_Korea and the growing North_Korean threat will be at the top of James Mattiss agenda this week when the new defense secretary visits South_Korea and Japan on his first foreign tripMattis a retired Marine general nicknamed Mad Dog will meet with Han Min-koo the South_Korean defense minister in Seoul on Thursday before heading to Tokyo Han is expected to reiterate South_Koreas commitment to hosting the Terminal_High Altitude Aerial Defense system or THAADBut with China exacting economic revenge on South_Korea over its and the South_Korean government in crisis some in Seoul now have jitters about the planMoon Jae-in an opposition candidate running at the top of the presidential polls has said decisions on the THAAD_deployment should wait until the next South_Korean administration is in placeThat could take months with the Constitutional_Court now deciding whether to uphold the National Assemblys motion to impeach President Park_Geun-hye who made the decision to host THAAD for her role in a sensational political scandal If the court forces her from office elections must be held within 60 days Otherwise they will take_place in December as scheduled In the meantime the Chinese government which has made no secret of its opposition to the THAAD plan is trying to persuade South_Korean political leaders to change their mindsAlthough Washington and Seoul insist that its purpose is to guard against the threat of North_Korean missiles Beijing views the system as another attempt to curtail its military expansionIn recent_weeks China has slapped a number of trade sanctions on South_Korea in an apparent effort to dissuade Seoul from going ahead with the deploymentChina is one of the biggest reasons why people are opposing THAAD and I would say that its based on reasonable concerns said Kim Dong-yub of the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul Just go into a department store and you can feel the change he said referring to the sudden drop in Chinese_tourists coming to South KoreaIn the past month China has banned imports of South_Korean bidet toilet seats and South_Korean cosmetics which are hugely popular among young women who love Korean dramas Classical musicians have joined K-pop stars in having visas denied and concerts canceled Meanwhile department stores in China run by Lotte the South_Korean retail group have been subject to a sudden flurry of safety and hygiene inspections and tax audits although Beijing rejects any suggestion that this is related to THAADLotte owns the country club 200 miles from Seoul earmarked for the THAAD battery It will swap with the government for another parcel of landLotte appeared to be taking it slow with the internal procedures needed to be completed before the swap can take_place a possible sign that it is worried about the impact on its business in China It has more_than 150 stores in China and is building a huge retail and amusement park complex in the southwestern city of ChengduChinese tourists accounted for more_than 70percent of Lotte Duty Frees sales in the first quarter of last_year It is true that we are sandwiched between our role as a South_Korean enterprise South_Koreas relations with China and possible economic loss the Yonhap_News Agency quoted a senior Lotte official as saying Small South_Korean companies are suffering too There has been a sharp decrease in Chinese_tourists said Kim Seo-kyung who owns a clothing store in Myeongdong a fashion district in Seoul usually teeming with Chinese shoppersMaybe its because of THAAD and because the relationship between South_Korea and China has soured Kim said She estimated that her revenue had fallen about 40percent since last yearBusinesses around South_Korea reported a sharp drop in tourist numbers over the Lunar New Year holiday this past weekendAmerican proponents of THAAD say they hope South_Korean authorities will not waverThe THAAD is a far more effective ballistic_missile defense_system than anything South_Korea has or will have for decades said Bruce Klingner a Northeast Asia specialist at the Heritage Foundation To not deploy THAAD is to choose to put South_Korea and US forces stationed there at grave risk to North_Korean nuclear chemical and biological attackNorth Koreas Kim_Jong Un has overseen the test of a solid-fuel_rocket engine state_media announced Thursday claiming a major technological advancement that could greatly increase Pyongyangs ability to strike other countries including the United StatesExperts are working to verify North_Koreas latest boast but if true it would mark another worrying development in the states pursuit of weapons of mass destructionThis is dangerous said senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation_Studies in Monterey CalifBased on the images we have we cant say whether this is functional she said But at this point we need to stop thinking about whether they have this technology or not because if they dont have it now they will have it soon and we need to start preparing for that dayNorth Koreas Korean_Central News_Agency (KCNA) on Thursday published a photo of Kim with the rocket against a graffiti-style sign that read Ruthless thunderbolt of fire for the American imperialists and Park Geun-hyes clique Park is the president of South_Korea and has been adopting an increasingly tough line against the North KCNA said Kim ordered the launch of a high-power solid-fuel_rocket engine that was designed and manufactured by the Korean styleThe engine spewed out huge flames with a deafening boom it saidThe engine would boost the power of ballistic rockets capable of mercilessly striking hostile forces the report said noting Kims great pleasure and satisfaction with what KCNA said was a successful testNorth Koreas rockets and missiles have been powered by a Soviet-era liquid-fuel engine which has to be loaded at the launch site That takes time which gives satellites an opportunity to spot activity taking placeBut solid-fuel rockets can be deployed much more quickly meaning there could be much less warning if any of a North_Korean missile_launch experts saidIf solid-fuel rockets are on mobile launchers which can be hidden in tunnels or buildings and wheeled out when theyre needed they could be deployed anywhere at short notice Analysts are now poring over photos to estimate the size of the rocket and glean any other details they can about its capability But in Seoul South_Koreas defense ministry was taking the claim seriouslyMoon Sang-gyun a spokesman for the defense ministry told_reporters Thursday that the military is preparing countermeasuresSeparately to be fully prepared to aggressively cope with North_Koreas reckless provocations her spokesman said Thursday The previous day North_Korea had threatened to North_Korea has a habit of making boasts that do not appear true as it continues work on nuclear_weapons and the means to deliver themIn recent months Pyongyang has claimed to have developed and a submarine-launched_ballistic missile Neither claim is borne out by seismic data and photo analysis experts say This month Kim claimed that North_Korea was able to miniaturize a nuclear_warhead Analysts were skeptical although US military leaders say it is only a matter of time until North_Korea masters this technologyNorth Korea is clearly making progress in some areas It is conducting frequent medium- and long-range missile_tests and every test enables its scientists to fix problems and improve capabilityThis should be a concern for American policymakers Hanham saidWe have a laundry list of things that we dont_want North_Korea to have We dont_want them to be road mobile we dont_want them to have longer ranges we dont_want them to have compact warheads we dont_want them to have solid-fuel motors she said The North_Koreans are basically going down that list and ticking everything offNorth Korea defiantly celebrated its fifth nuclear_test Friday claiming that it can now make warheads small enough to fit onto a missile and warning its enemies specifically the United_States that it has the ability to counter any attackAlthough the Norths proclaimed advancements could not be verified and Pyongyang has a track record of exaggeration the test appeared to mark another step toward North_Koreas goal of putting a nuclear_warhead on a weapon_capable of reaching the mainland United StatesFridays test the Norths second this year underscored the ability of Kim_Jong Uns_regime to make progress on its nuclear and missile_programs despite waves of international sanctions and isolation This is our response to hostile powers including the United_States We are sending out a message that if the enemies attack us we can counterattack Ri Chun Hee a veteran North_Korean newsreader said on state television We will_continue taking measures to protect our dignity and our right to exist from the American threat The test also appeared to be much bigger than North_Koreas previous four detonations since its first in 2006The US Geological Survey detected an artificial near North_Koreas nuclear_test site at 9 am local time on Friday a national holiday marking the 68th anniversary of the formation of the communist regime by Kim_Il Sung the current leaders grandfatherThis is clearly a nuclear_test said Jeffrey_Lewis director of the East_Asia nonproliferation program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation_Studies in Monterey Calif He estimated the size at between 10 and 20 kilotons The Norths last nuclear_test carried_out in January was about six kilotonsThe test happened just a few hours after President Obamas plane stopped in Japan to refuel on his way home from Laos where he attended a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) The president talked to South_Koreas president Park_Geun-hye who was still in Laos and Japanese_Prime Minister_Shinzo Abe said White_House press_secretary Josh EarnestIn a White_House statement Friday Obama called the test a grave threat to regional and international security and noted Pyongyangs claims to be developing nuclear warheads capable of hitting the United_States and its alliesThe United_States does_not and never will accept North_Korea as a nuclear state Obama said Far from achieving its stated national_security and economic_development goals North_Koreas provocative and destabilizing actions have instead served to isolate and impoverish its people through its relentless pursuit of nuclear_weapons and ballistic_missile capabilities He said the latest test shows that North_Korea has no interest in being a responsible member of the international communityAfter consulting by phone with the South_Korean and Japanese leaders Obama said they would work with the UN_Security Council and international_community to impose significant penalties including new sanctions He also vowed to push ahead with deployment of a Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defense_(THAAD) battery in South_Korea and pledged to provide extended deterrence guaranteed by the full spectrum of US defense capabilitiesAt a news_conference Thursday in Laos Obama dismissed Chinas objections to the THAAD_deployment saying he told Chinese President_Xi Jinping that we cannot have a situation where were unable to defend either ourselves or our treaty allies against increasingly provocative behavior and escalating capabilities by the North_Koreans Obama added And I indicated to him that if the THAAD bothered him particularly since it has no purpose other than defensive and does_not change the strategic balance between the United_States and China that they need to work with us more effectively to change Pyongyangs behavior China the closest thing North_Korea has to an ally issued a statement resolutely opposing the test which it said took_place despite the widespread objection of the international communityWe strongly urge North_Korea to keep its promise to denuclearize to abide by relevant resolutions from the UN_Security Council and to stop making any moves that worsen the situation the statement from Chinas Foreign_Ministry saidIn its official announcement of what it said was a nuclear_warhead explosion test North_Korea claimed that it had been able to make smaller lighter and diversified nuclear warheads of higher strike powerThis has definitely put on a higher level the [countrys] technology of mounting nuclear warheads on ballistic rockets said the statement carried by the official Korean_Central News_Agency Kim has been ordering speedy progress on missile development as evidenced by recent salvos of medium-range missiles and has been making observable gains with nuclear devices But there remains no clear evidence that North_Koreas scientists have been able to put the two together to make a warhead that can be delivered to a targetHowever a growing number of analysts and American military chiefs believe it is just a matter of time until North_Korea masters this technologyThis test seemed to have a dual purpose said Yang Moo-jin a professor at the University of North_Korean Studies in SeoulDomestically Kim_Jong Un wants to present himself as a strong leader standing strong against the US he said He suggested that this could be because Kim at 32 is young but also perhaps because recent high-level defections have raised speculation of cracks in the regimeInternationally this test is designed to show that sanctions_imposed against North_Korea and international pressure are not working Theyre urging the world to accept its failure and revise its North_Korea policy Yang saidFridays test highlights North_Koreas continued defiance but also the ineffectiveness of even the most recent waves of tough sanctions_imposed after the nuclear_test in January analysts saidThe whole expectation eight or nine months_ago was that sanctions were finally going to bring North_Korea to heel but clearly that is not the case said David Kang a professor of international relations at the University of Southern California Clearly they respond to pressure with pressure of their own Still the international_community is expected to look for ways to inflict more pain on North_Korea which is already under sweeping sanctionsNorth Koreas desperate dependence on nuclear development is testimony to Kim_Jong Uns fanatical recklessness said Park the South_Korean president who cut short her visit to Laos to return to Seoul North_Koreas provocations will do nothing but accelerate its self-destructionIn Tokyo prime_minister Abe also struck an angry toneIf North_Korea conducted a nuclear_test I cant absolutely tolerate it he said We have to strongly protestAfter North_Koreas nuclear_test in January which the regime claimed was of a hydrogen_bomb and a long-range ballistic_missile test in February the UN_Security Council imposed tough new sanctionsIt ordered a ban on mineral exports from North_Korea a major source of income for the regime and strict inspections of all cargo going in and out of the country The United_States followed with new financial sanctions and by designating Kim_Jong Un by name for human_rights abuses South_Korea has also taken a strident approach closing an inter-Korean industrial park that had been a major source of revenue for the regimeBut Kim has not wavered testing a range of missiles this year and apparently making some technological progress including on a submarine-launched_ballistic missileTheres now obvious progress in North_Koreas nuclear and missile_programs They seem to be making precisely the technical progress that people dont_want said Euan Graham a security expert_at the Lowy Institute in Sydney who once served_as a British diplomat in Pyongyang North_Korea is obviously prepared to take the economic pain and is able to continue to materially supply the two programs On Monday North_Korea launched three medium-range missiles as China was hosting a meeting of Group of 20 leaders including Obama The rockets flew 620 miles falling inside_Japans air defense identification zoneA day after those launches the Security_Council issued its latest condemnationThe members of the Security_Council deplore all the Democratic_Peoples Republic of Koreas ballistic_missile activities including these launches noting that such activities contribute to [its] development of nuclear_weapons delivery systems and increase tension the council said in statement Tuesday using North_Koreas official nameAnalysts expect another_round of discussions on ways to put pressure on North KoreaSanctions and targeted financial measures may take time to have an impact on the regimes financial condition said Bruce Klingner a northeast Asia specialist at the Heritage Foundation a conservative Washington-based think tankThe difficulty Klingner said would be in maintaining international resolve Sanctions can not be effectively implemented without the support of ChinaChinas implementation of sanctions has been patchy in the past and some analysts are concerned that Beijing angered by South_Koreas decision to host an American anti-missile battery might lose its appetite for enforcement William Branigin in Washington Yoonjung_Seo in Seoul Gu Jinglu in Beijing and Yuki Oda in Tokyo contributed to this reportNorth Korea fired a ballistic_missile Sunday morning its first provocation since Donald Trump was elected president of the United_States and one that sets up a test for the new administration in WashingtonThe missile was fired shortly before 8am local time from a known test_site in North Pyongan province in the west of the country not far from the border with China and flew over the Korean_Peninsula and into the Sea of Japan South_Koreas joint chiefs of staff saidThe launch happened while President Trump was hosting Japanese_Prime Minister_Shinzo Abe at his golf resort in Florida In a brief joint appearance after the news of the missile test the two presented a united front Abe called the test absolutely intolerable He said that in his summit with Trump at the White_House on Friday the president assured me the United_States will always stand with Japan 100 percentAfter Abe spoke Trump who had been standing behind him took the microphone and said I just want everybody to understand and fully know that the United_States of America stands behind Japan its great ally 100percentTrump did_not mention South_Korea also an important US ally Neither leader answered questionsSouth Koreas military leaders were still working to analyze data from the projectile but said it appeared to be a medium-range Musudan missile the type that North_Korea had been trying to perfect last_year The Musudan is technically capable of flying as far as 2400 miles putting Guam within range and almost reaching Alaska But the joint chiefs said this missile appeared to fly only 300 miles The military is determining if the missile is a modified Musudan intermediate-range ballistic_missile or the shorter range Rodong missile a military official told the Souths Yonhap_News AgencyBut some analysts thought the launch could have been the first stages of an_intercontinental ballistic_missile capable of reaching the United StatesI think were all waiting for the first two stages of the ICBM said Jeffrey_Lewis of the Center for Nonproliferation_Studies at the Middlebury_Institute of International_Studies They finished testing that engine on the stand so now its time to test it in the airI dont_think this [missile test] is designed to respond to Trump I_think this is part of Kim_Jong Uns continued efforts to try to advance his programs said Jon Wolfsthal a senior nonproliferation official in the Obama_administration now at Harvards Belfer Center But it has the added effect of calling Trumps bluff The real question is not what North_Korea has done but what the US is going to do about it he saidKims regime has declared a goal of producing an_intercontinental missile that can deliver a nuclear payload to the United_States and last_year appeared to be making a concerted effort toward achieving that goal It conducted two nuclear_tests and dozens of missile_tests including eight Musudan tests Only one in June was a success flying about 250miles and reaching a surprisingly high altitudeBut the regime had not fired any since October perhaps to avoid influencing domestic politics in the United_States ahead of the presidential_election and in South_Korea where the conservative president has been impeached and there is now a good chance of a progressive administration that is friendlier to PyongyangIn his New Years address Kim said that North_Korea had test-fired in various ways for a nuclear strike to cope with the imperialists nuclear war threats and said that the country had entered the final stage of preparation for the test launch of intercontinental_ballistic missile In response Trump tweeted North_Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear_weapon capable of reaching parts of the US It wont happenBut apart from repeating the usual pledges to work to stop North_Korea from reaching its nuclear goals the Trump administration has said little on what it would do to stop Kim The administration is understood to be embarking on a view of North_Korea after eight years in which the Obama_administration practiced strategic patience hoping that it could wait out North KoreaIn Seoul the national_security council convened a meeting and acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn said the South_Korean government would work with its allies to ensure a concerted response to punish North_Korea John Wagner in Florida and David Nakamura in Washington contributed to this reportNorth Korea fired three medium-range ballistic_missiles into the sea off its east coast Monday landing close to Japan in a show of force that coincided with the meeting of leaders of the worlds 20 largest economies in neighboring ChinaNorth Korea launched the missiles believed to be Rodongs from a site south of Pyongyang at 1214 pm local time South_Koreas military said They flew about 600_miles and landed well inside_Japans air defense identification zone the area in which Tokyo controls aircraft movementThe launches coming as the G-20 meeting continued in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou and just days before North_Korea marks the 68th anniversary of the formation of its government constituted an armed protest an official from South_Koreas joint chiefs of staff said in a statementWe are fully prepared to fight tonight in case North_Korea makes any provocative moves the statement said according to the Yonhap_News Agency using the catchphrase of the American and South_Korean military alliesJapans Defense Ministry added that the missiles landed between 120 and 160 miles west of Hokkaido the northernmost of Japans four main islandsAt the G-20 meeting South_Korean President Park_Geun-hye and Japanese_Prime Minister_Shinzo Abe met immediately and agreed to cooperate against North KoreaIn Washington State_Department spokesman John Kirby said the United_States strongly condemns the launchesThese launches which have become far too common in the past several months violate multiple UN_Security Council Resolutions explicitly prohibiting North_Koreas launches using ballistic_missile technology he said in a statement adding that US officials would raise the issue during the meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Laos on TuesdayOur commitment to the defense of our allies in the face of these threats remains ironclad Kirby saidMondays launches were just the latest salvo in a steady series of missiles coming from North_Korea Last month Kim_Jong Uns_regime claimed a great success in launching a ballistic_missile from a submarine about 300 miles toward Japan on top of making progress on its medium-range Musudan missile technology This is a particularly tense time in the region because of frictions over the Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defence (THAAD) anti-missile battery that the United_States will deploy to South_Korea part of their defense against North KoreaBeijing has protested strongly against the plan viewing it as part of an American effort to restrain a strengthening China and worrying that the system will home in on Chinas military activitiesThe issue has helped close the gap_between China and its erstwhile client state North_Korea after the provocations of a nuclear_test and long-range missile_launch earlier_this year Beijing and Pyongyang have traditionally been as close as lips and teeth as the saying goes but Xi_Jinping Chinas president has made his disdain for the young Kim clear Earlier in the day during a bilateral meeting at the G-20 with Xi Park said she hoped Seoul and Beijing would be able to unite together against North KoreaI hope that through earnest communication our two_countries can turn this challenge into an opportunity to further strengthen and move_forward our bilateral relationship Park said during a bilateral meeting with Xi according to YonhapBut Xi reiterated his strong objections to Parks decision to accept the THAAD battery onto South_Korean soilMishandling the issue is not conducive to strategic stability in the region and could intensify disputes Xi told Park according to a report from the Chinese state-run news_agency XinhuaNorth Korean leader Kim_Jong Un boasted about the greatest success of a ballistic_missile launched from a submarine this week which appeared to be a major technological breakthrough for the nuclear-armed nationAfter a series of flops North_Korea launched a missile from a submarine near its east coast port of Sinpo early Wednesday It flew about 300 miles before falling into the sea inside_Japans air defense identification zone the area in which Tokyo controls aircraft movementThe launch apparently of a KN-11 or North Star missile contravenes UN resolutions and was roundly condemned by Japan South_Korea and China as well as by the United_States and the United NationsBut in North_Koreas state news media Thursday the apparently successful launch was cause for major celebration The Rodong Sinmun the newspaper of the ruling Korean Workers_Party carried seven color photos on its front page Thursday including a large one of Kim surrounded by military officials all of them smiling broadlySuch images are used in North_Korean propaganda in an effort to convince the populace who have little if any access to outside information that their impoverished and technologically backward country is strong and standing up to a United_States that the state_media say is trying to destroy North_Korea Kim lauded the missile_launch as a great manifestation and demonstration of the tremendous power and inexhaustible muscle according to the state-run Korean_Central News AgencyNorth Korea has joined the front rank of the military powers fully equipped with nuclear attack capability and the US mainland is now within North_Koreas striking range he saidThe missile was launched at a steep angle a South_Korean military source told Yonhap_News Agency in Seoul and probably could have traveled for more_than 600_miles if it had been fired at a regular angleThe launch coincided with the start of annual drills between the South_Korean and US militaries exercises that always elicit an angry reaction from the North which views them as a pretext for an invasion The young North_Korean leader came out with another_round of bluster ThursdayI do not guess what ridiculous remarks the US and its followers will make about this test-fire but I can say their rash acts will only precipitate their self-destruction Kim reportedly said The military has also clearly been trying to advance its ballistic_missile program conducting a series of land- and sea-based tests over the past_year It appears to be trying to work on its intermediate-range Musudan missile which can theoretically reach Guam and its submarine-launched missiles which would give it the ability to stage an attack from seaThe tests have had a patchy record of success The most recent KN-11 launches three in the past_year were all deemed failures because the missiles exploded at launch or traveled only a short distanceBut analysts say that even failures offer lessons for North_Koreas rocket scientistsJoseph S Bermudez a military analyst affiliated with the Washington-based US-Korea Institute at SAIS said this weeks test showed that North_Korea remains strongly committed to the long-term development of an operational submarine-launched_ballistic missile (SLBM) and is learning from its previous successes and failures Assuming the current rate of development while North_Korea still faces significant technological challenges including building a new class of submarine to carry the missile it is on track to develop the capability to strike targets in the region including Japan by 2020 Bermudez said in a commentary The latest launch was widely condemnedStphane Dujarric spokesman for UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said North_Koreas defiance of the international_community was deeply troubling The foreign ministers of Japan South_Korea and even China North_Koreas main ally said after a meeting in Tokyo that the launch was totally unacceptableNorth Korea launched four_missiles Monday morning a provocative barrage that coincided both with joint US-South Korean military_exercises on the southern half of the peninsula and with the opening of the annual National Peoples Congress in ChinaThe launches follow a remarkable month in which Kim_Jong Uns_regime tested a solid-fuel_rocket that it says is part of an_intercontinental ballistic_missile capable of hitting the United_States and in which the regime is accused of assassinating the leaders half_brother Both actions have angered allies and adversaries in the region and Mondays launches will only exacerbate thatEvery year this time they try to do something to defy the exercises said Bruce Bennett a North_Korea expert_at the Rand Corp in California This time I_think theyre also interested in making a statement to the Chinese and to let Beijing know this coal ban is going to hurt he said referring to Beijings decision last_month to stop importing coal from North_Korea cutting off a major economic lifelineThe four_missiles were fired from a known launch site on North_Koreas west coast not far from the border with China at 736 am local time They flew more_than 600_miles across the country before splashing into the sea between Japan and the Korean_Peninsula the Souths Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a text message to local reportersThe joint chiefs initially suspected that at_least one of the projectiles might have been an_intercontinental ballistic_missile capable of hitting the United_States West Coast but later backed away from that analysis A US defense official said the Pentagon does_not think the missile was an ICBMThe US Strategic Command said its systems detected and tracked the projectile but determined the missile_launch from North_Korea did_not pose a threat to North America Regardless the launches have ratcheted up the tensions in the regionSouth Korea strongly condemns North_Koreas missile_launch today as a direct challenge and grave provocation despite warnings by the international_community Hwang Kyo-ahn the prime_minister who is acting president said during an emergency meeting of the national_security council North_Koreas nuclear missile provocation is a real and imminent threat against the lives and safety of South KoreansIn Japan the government said three of the missiles had landed perilously close splashing down within its exclusive_economic zone and within about 200 miles of its coastline in Akita prefectureThese missile_launches clearly show that North_Korea has developed a new threat a visibly worried Prime_Minister Shinzo_Abe told_reporters in Tokyo We will collect information and strongly protest to North KoreaBennett of Rand said the range of the missiles could have served_as a warning to China The missiles had 12 of Chinas 20 largest cities within reach he saidChina expressed its dismay over the launch with a Foreign_Ministry spokeswoman saying it opposes launches that undermine UN resolutions Russia meanwhile was more blunt describing itself as seriously worried about the launches which raise tensions in the region North_Korea has repeatedly claimed to be working on an ICBM capable of reaching the west coast of the United_States and has been making observable progress toward this goal In his New Years address Kim said North_Korea had entered the final stage of preparation for a test-launch of an_intercontinental ballistic missileRegardless of whether Mondays launch was an ICBM it is just a matter of time until North_Korea succeeds in its goal of making one said Jeffrey_Lewis director of the East_Asia Non-Proliferation Program at the Middlebury_Institute of International_Studies at Monterey in CaliforniaIt doesnt matter if its today or tomorrow or next week or next year thats where this is heading Lewis said But we have no plan other than saying this is unacceptable or that it wont happen he added referring to a tweet from President Trump earlier_this yearAfter Kims statement in a Jan 1 address that North_Korea was working on its ICBM program Trump tweeted It wont happen His administration is reviewing its policy toward North_Korea which was characterized as strategic patience during the Obama_administration waiting for sanctions to hurt and a humbled Kim to come to the negotiating table The latest provocation came as large-scale military_exercises involving more_than 320000 South_Korean and US troops and high-tech US firepower continue in South_Korea They began last_week and will_continue through the end of AprilIn the past_year or two the with the two militaries practicing decapitation strikes on the North_Korean leadershipNorth Korea denounced the exercises and warned last_week that it was ready to retaliate North_Korea will never remain a passive onlooker to the new US administration overtly revealing its intention to put military pressure on [North Korea] and invade it while crying out for peace by dint of strength the state-run Korean_Central News_Agency reported in a statement it attributed to the Foreign MinistryNorth Korea last_month its first since Trump was elected president The missile appeared to show significant technological advances with upgraded power and range and analysts said it could mark another step in the push toward the capacity to hit Alaska or Washington stateAfter that Kims regime is suspected of ordering the assassination on the leaders half_brother Kim_Jong Nam who was attacked with a chemical weapon at the airport in Kuala_Lumpur Malaysia and died within 20 minutesThe assassination led the Trump administration to to go to New_York for meetings with former US officials involved in North_Korea policy which would have been the first time in more_than five_years that such a meeting had taken place on US soil Yoonjung_Seo in Seoul Yuki Oda in Tokyo and Missy Ryan in Washington contributed to this reportNorth Korea on Sunday declared that it had successfully put an earth observation satellite into_orbit under the direct orders of leader Kim_Jong Un and said it planned to launch many moreBoth the South_Korean defense ministry and the launched at 9 am North_Korean time from a launch pad near the Chinese border appeared to have successfully reached spaceThe United_States Japan and South_Korea immediately condemned the launch a move widely seen as another step toward North_Korea mastering the technology for making a missile_capable of striking the mainland United_States The UN_Security Council called an emergency meeting for later Sunday to discuss how to respond to the countrys latest provocationBut North_Korea gloated about its most recent advance into space It said it that it had fired a Kwangmyongsong-4 (the name translates as lode star) a newer-model satellite than the one launched three years_ago and one that it said was equipped with devices for Earth measurement and communicationTodays success is a proud result of scientific achievement and an exercise of our legitimate right to space Ri Chun Hee North_Koreas most famous newsreader who was brought out of retirement to announce declared in a special broadcast from Pyongyang following the launchThe success of Kwangmyongsong-4 launch is a groundbreaking event The National Aerospace Development Administration plans to launch many more satellites following our national policy of focusing on the importance of science and technology she saidKim the 33-year-old third-generation leader of North_Korea personally signed the order to launch on Saturday Ri said The satellite entered orbit after nine minutes and 46 seconds she said in the broadcast on The launch took_place half an hour before the Republican presidential debate started and candidates Donald Trump and Sen Marco Rubio (R-Fla) both urged China to get tough The rocket launch was expected Pyongyang had to maritime and airspace authorities and analysts had detected movement at its launch site but coming just a month after a nuclear_test it nevertheless showed Kims continued willingness to defy the international communityThe rocket was projected to fly down South_Koreas west coast with the first stage expected to splash down near the southern island of Jeju while the second stage was forecast to go over the southern Japanese islands of Okinawa and in the sea east of the Philippines Television stations in Japan and South_Korea showed footage of the rocket flying through the skyThe rocket went missing from South_Korean military radar in the sea near Jeju Island at 936 am said defense ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun but the Japanese government said that it passed over the southern islands of Okinawa at about 941 am There were no reports of any debris falling on landWe can definitely say that this was an attempted space launch said Melissa Hanham a nuclear expert_at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation StudiesNorth Korea previously fired a Kwangmyongsong-3 on an Unha-3 (galaxy) missile into_orbit in December 2012 the month that North_Korea marked the first anniversary of the death of Kim_Jong Il the current leaders father Kims regime had said it would launch the same kind of satellite into_orbit and the launch came a few hours after that window began Sundays launch also coincides with another key date North_Koreas celebration of Kim_Jong Ils birthday Feb 16North Korea has said the launches were of satellites intended for scientific purposes but analysts and many governments see this as a disguised missile test North_Korea has successfully launched short- and medium-range missiles but has been working to develop a reliable long-range intercontinental_ballistic missile_capable of reaching the West Coast of the United StatesThis kind of rocket is designed as a space launch vehicle Before we can consider it an_intercontinental ballistic_missile there are a number of modifications that have to be made Hanham said A space rocket goes into the atmosphere to launch a satellite into_orbit but an_intercontinental ballistic_missile needs to return to Earth from the atmosphere to reach its target and deliver a warheadJim Walsh a research associate in the Security Studies Program at MIT said that even though most of North_Koreas rocket and missile_tests had been failures and Pyongyang was still using liquid-launched rockets a technology now considered archaic everywhere else there was still reason for concernThis doesnt mean that theyre not making progress The more tests they do the more they learn and theyre beavering away trying to improve their technology he said And it also means that at some level theyre still able to evade sanctionsNevertheless the international_community immediately resumed calls for North_Korea to face strong punishment for its actions through more sanctionsA spokesman for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called the launch deeply deplorable and exhorted North_Korea to halt its provocative actions and return to compliance with its international obligations Both South_Korean President Park_Geun-hye and Japanese_Prime Minister_Shinzo Abe called emergency meetings of their national_security councils during which both said they could not accept such a provocationFrom Washington Susan Rice President Obamas national_security adviser said that the launch using ballistic_missile technology following so closely after North_Koreas fourth_nuclear test represents yet_another destabilizing and provocative action and is a flagrant violation of multiple United_Nations Security_Council resolutionsNorth Koreas missile and nuclear_weapons programs represent serious threats to our interests including the security of some of our closest allies and undermine peace and security in the broader region she said in a statement Rice also reiterated calls mainly directed at China North_Koreas closest ally and a veto-wielding permanent member of the Security_Council for the international_community to stand together and demonstrate to North_Korea that its reckless actions must have serious consequencesBut China does_not seem particularly keen to crack down on its neighbor A immediately after the launch said Amid criticism and condemnation what should be borne in mind is that negotiations are the only viable solution to the predicament on the Korean_Peninsula as China has repeatedly pointed outA series of UN resolutions has prohibited North_Korea from carrying out nuclear or ballistic_missile tests but Kims regime has shown little regard for these orders Yoongjung Seo in Seoul and Yuki Oda in Tokyo contributed to this reportNorth Korea was practicing to strike United_States military bases in Japan with its state_media in Pyongyang reported Tuesday and it appeared to be trying to outsmart a new American antimissile_battery being deployed to South_Korea by firing multiple rockets at onceKim Jong_Un presided over Mondays launch of the four_missiles feasting his eyes on the trails of ballistic rockets the state-run Korean_Central News_Agency reported in a statement that analysts called a brazen declaration of the countrys intent to strike enemies with a nuclear_weapon if it came under attackIf the United_States or South_Korea fires even a single flame inside North_Korean territory we will demolish the origin of the invasion and provocation with a nuclear tipped missile the KCNA statement saidThe four ballistic_missiles fired Monday morning were launched by the elite Hwasong ballistic_missile division tasked to strike the bases of the US imperialist aggressor forces in Japan KCNA said The United_States has numerous military bases and about 54000 military personnel stationed in Japan the legacy of its postwar security alliance with the countryThree of the four_missiles flew about 600_miles over North_Korea and landed in the sea within Japans_exclusive economic_zone off the Oga Peninsula in Akita prefecture home to a Japanese self-defense forces base The fourth fell just outside the zone North_Korea did_not say what kind of missiles it had fired but after poring over photos released by state_media analysts at the Middlebury_Institute of International_Studies in California said they were extended-range Scuds capable of flying more_than 600 milesNorth Korea has tested these types of missiles before so the point of Mondays launches was not to see if the rockets would fly but to test how quickly the unit could set them up and deploy them classic training for a wartime situation said Jeffrey_Lewis director of the East_Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury InstituteThey want to know if they can get these missiles out into the field rapidly and deploy them all at once Lewis said They are practicing launching a nuclear-armed missile and hitting targets in Japan as if this was a real war North_Koreas extended-range Scud is halfway between a traditional short-range Scud and the medium-range missile known as the Rodong But they can be produced much more cheaply than the Rodong Lewis said meaning that North_Korea could fire them with more abandonKCNA reported that the four_missiles were launched simultaneously and that Kim commented that they are so accurate that they look like acrobatic flying corps in formationThis appeared to be a further challenge to the United_States and South_Korea which said Tuesday that it had started deploying the advanced antimissile_battery called Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defense or THAAD designed to protect the region against North_Koreas rockets The first parts of the THAAD system arrived Monday at Osan Air Base south of Seoul South_Koreas Defense Ministry saidBut THAAD would have difficulty intercepting four_missiles launched at the same_time analysts saidFurthermore Osan Air Base is less_than 300 miles from the missile_launch site in North_Korea another apparent message to Pyongyangs enemiesThe launches coincided with joint US-South Korean military_exercises on the southern half of the Korean_Peninsula drills that take_place every year and that North_Korea views as preparation for an invasion After the missiles were launched Monday the US Strategic Command said it had determined that the missile_launch did_not pose a threat to North AmericaBut KCNA reported that the 33-year-old Kim had ordered the strategic forces to be on high alert as required by the grim situation in which an actual war may break out anytime and get fully ready to promptly moveNorth Korea has been making clear progress on its missile program and has a declared goal of developing an_intercontinental ballistic_missile capable of reaching the West Coast of the United_States It has also conducted five nuclear_tests and claims to be able to miniaturize a warhead so that it could be fitted onto a missileHowever it has not yet proven the ability to either attach a warhead to a missile or to be able to deliver a missile to a target something that would involve mastering the difficult step of reentry The launches also appeared designed to send a message to both President Trump and the Japanese prime_minister Shinzo_Abe said Joshua Pollack editor of the Nonproliferation ReviewWe might infer that the choice of Japan as a target might be based on a desire to do something new compared to last_year raising the stakes of the exercises but also on Abes visit to the US and joint appearances with Trump Pollack saidNorth Korea launched a medium-range missile last_month its first since Trump was elected while the president was hosting Abe for dinner at his Mar-a-Lago_Club in FloridaTrump spoke by phone with Abe and South_Koreas acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn Tuesday morningBoth Japan and the US confirmed that this North_Korean missile_launch was a clear violation of UN_Security Council_resolutions and was an obvious challenge to the region and the international_community Abe told_reporters in Tokyo repeating his assertion that the North_Korean threat had reached a new stageIn New_York a spokesman for UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres said he condemned the actions which violate Security_Council resolutions and seriously undermine regional peace and stabilityPyongyang cant stop shooting (a) missiles into the sea and (b) itself in the footAt 736 am Monday local time North_Korea launched four_missiles that flew about 600_miles over land before splashing into the Sea of Japan As my colleague Anna Fifield three landed within Japans_exclusive economic_zone dropping about 200 miles from the coastThe test was timed to provoke It came not a month after North_Korea tested a solid-fuel_rocket that it claims is part of an_intercontinental ballistic_missile capable of hitting the United_States and three weeks after the in Malaysia of ruler Kim_Jong Uns_half brother Kim_Jong Nam who had been under Chinese protectionIt also coincided withjoint US-South Korean military_exercises on the southern half of the Korean_Peninsula and to Beijings certain dismay the opening of Chinas National Peoples Congress the Communist Partys tightly scripted not-to-be-interrupted-or-overshadowed political spectacleIndeed although North_Korea has been getting on a lot of nerves lately it may be China that is most acutely frustrated And since China is North_Koreas only real ally that could hurt Kim_Jong UnChina and North_Korea used to be tight Mao Zedong once said the neighbors were as close as lips and teethBut in recent years China has grown frustrated with the Norths potentially destabilizing economic woes as well as a nuclear program that from Beijings perspective keeps the US military at the gateAlthough critics have long accused Beijing of propping up the Kim regime the Chinese side responded to last months rocket test and assassination with what appeared to be a real piece of economic punishment Beijing coal imports a financial lifeline for North_Korea until the end of 2017Mondays test will only deepen Beijings displeasure China is in the midst of a major campaign against US plans to deploy the (THAAD)_system to South_Korea THAAD is a land-based missile_defense system that would be operated by US troops stationed in South_Korea Seoul and Washington argue it is a necessary defense against North KoreaBut China hates the plan To Beijing THAAD is a security threat designed to undermine the Chinese military a strategic plot hatched by the Americans In recent_weeks China has stepped up public criticism of the project and moved to punish South_Korea for forging ahead with the plan>Chinas party-controlled press is already about destroying or blinding the THAAD system To express its displeasure with South_Korea China has also to pop stars and pulled wildly popular South_Korean television dramas off the air Lets see how far South_Korean TV dramas and stars can go without strong support from the Chinese market read one editorial in the Global_Times a newspaper known for its nationalist toneThe THAAD installation is a mighty blow against strategic mutual trust between Beijing and Seoul the paper continued Ties will inevitably hit rock bottom and this will be a loss for both_sides In the long-run China needs to get ready to confront SeoulThe US and South_Korea are not dealing with the THAAD issue very well because they have not fully considered Chinas security concernssaidCui Zhiying director of the Korean_Peninsula Research Center at Shanghais Tongji University All parties should cooperate on this issue instead of the US and South_Korea getting together to suppress ChinaAnd thats just it China never liked North_Koreas missile_tests but right_now they are particularly inconvenient Interrupting Chinas National Peoples Congress with yet_another missile test makes it harder for Beijing to rail against South_Koreas plans because it makes THAADs stated purpose shooting down North_Korean missiles seem legitChina on Monday expressed wary dismay at the latest development with a spokesman for the Foreign_Ministry saying Beijing opposes launches that undermine United_Nations Security_Council resolutions Behind closed doors Chinese cadres will no doubt have more to say to their erstwhile friendsKeeping up its drumbeat of colorfully worded threats North_Korea warned Wednesday that it may launch an ultra-precision strike to scorch the South_Korean presidents officeTensions are running high on the Korean_Peninsula as the United_States and South_Korea conduct and mounting against Pyongyang start to biteIncensed at both efforts North_Koreas propaganda machine has been outdoing itself with ever-more inventive and florid statementsIn its latest missive the Norths organization in charge of relations with the South declared that Pyongyangs forces were prepared to annihilat[e] the enemy without mercyWe do not hide the fact that it may start inside the Cheong wa Dae or near it the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said in a statement carried Wednesday by the Norths Korean_Central News_Agency using the Korean term for South_Koreas presidential Blue_House President Park_Geun-hye lives and works thereAll the dens of the enemy in South_Korea including the Cheong wa Dae are the primary targets of the ultra-precision strike means it said Powerful large-caliber multiple-rocket-launching systems are at the ready to scorch the Cheong wa Dae bossed by Park_Geun-hye in a jiffy North_Koreas state_media have recently been running footage of Kim_Jong Un the states leader overseeing launches from what it calls a Korean-style large-caliber multiple-launch rocket system Some of the projectiles appear to have been launched from a mobile system akin to the one Pyongyang has describedOnce their buttons are pushed [Cheong wa Dae] is bound to be reduced to a sea in flames and ashes the committee said in the reportTensions between the two Koreas divided since the end of World WarII have been running particularly high in recent months after Kim in January ordered the and then oversaw what is thought to have been the launch of a Park who had been pursuing a trustpolitik approach of using carrots and sticks on North_Korea has this year abandoned any attempt at engaging the Pyongyang regime and has instead taken a surprisingly tough approach She that had generated hundreds of millions of dollars for the North and imposed tough new sanctions on the regimeNorth Koreas response has been typically shrill but also with the regime calling the Souths first female president a capricious whore among various choice labelsPark vowed Wednesday to continue exerting pressure on North_Korea over its nuclear and missile programsWe will create the conditions in which North_Korea cannot survive unless it changes she said in a speech at a hotel in Seoul according to the Yonhap_News AgencyNorth Korea has a habit of making threats on which it cannot practically follow through Nevertheless the annual joint military_exercises in the South and the increased military activities in the North have ensured that tensions are running higher than usualThe diplomats decision to defect from a regime he had spent his whole life defending did_not happen overnightInstead his misgivings had been simmering for two_decades even as he went around Europe espousing the superiority of the North_Korean system They finally reached a boiling point when Thae Yong-ho realized that this regime to which he had been so loyal expected him to lie to his childrenIve known that there was no future for North_Korea for a long time Thae told The Washington_Post in his first interview with the foreign media since his escape from the North_Korean Embassy in London where he served_as deputy ambassadorBut last_summer he realized his hopes had been misplaced that supreme leader who was educated in Switzerland and is only 33 would turn out to be a reformer Thae fled together with his wife and his two sons now ages 19 and 26Kim Jong_Un is still young Thae said I was afraid that even my grandsons would have to live under this system I decided that if I didnt cut the chains of slavery off [my sons] they would complain Why didnt you let us be freeThae is the highest ranking diplomat to defect from North_Korea After several months being debriefed by the South_Korean intelligence service he was in Seoul speaking out against the regimes reign of terror Over the past month Thae has predicted to South_Korean media the demise of North_Korea with the same fervor with which he once extolled its glories His hard-line statements happen to fit nicely with the hawkish stance taken by the South_Korean government over the past eight years But Thae said he was not being expedient and was speaking his real mind and was intent on using his influence for goodEveryone knows about my defection Just staying at home or living a quiet life would not effect any change in North_Korea Thae a genial 54-year-old who speaks impeccable English said during an interview in a hotel hereSouth Korean authorities are concerned about Thaes safety and the possibility of an attempt on his life North_Korea released a tirade against him after his defection calling him human scum and a criminal and has made attempts once successfully on the lives of other high-profile defectors Thae was accompanied by an entourage of bodyguards and intelligence officials to the interviewHe spent more_than two hours describing his disappointment with Kim his fears for his children and his conviction that giving North_Koreans information about the outside_world would help sow the seeds of dissent just as it had for him and his familyThe regime can only stay in place by preventing outside information he said People there are not educated about the outside_world and have no opportunity to experience freedom or a system that is differentIn North_Korea the Internet is banned for all but a handful of elites radios and televisions play only state propaganda and the newspapers are full of the leaders great feats South_Korean dramas are increasingly being smuggled into North_Korea but people watch them in secret fearing severe punishment if they are caughtThae said that anything to break the information blockade in North_Korea should be encouraged from USB drives containing foreign films to radios that can be tuned to news broadcasts from abroadI would like to make it possible for people to rise up he said We should educate the North_Korean people so that they can have their own Korean SpringThaes grandfather and father were devoted to the Kim dynasty and Thae grew up knowing only North_Koreas peculiar brand of communist personality cult Then in the 1990s as a relatively young diplomat he was posted to Denmark where his younger son was born and after that to SwedenIn Scandinavia home to the flagbearers of European socialism Thaes eyes began to openDuring my first foreign posting in Denmark I came to doubt and question whether North_Korea could say that it was a true socialist or communist system he said Thaes time there coincided with a devastating famine in North_Korea that killed as many as 3 million peopleNorth Korean society doesnt have the concept of comparing he said The more time you spend in the outside_world the disbelief in your system grows more and moreThae then did two stints in the embassy in London first between 2004 and 2008 then from 2013 until his defection last_summer It was during this second stint in London in the second year of Kim_Jong Uns_regime that Thaes concerns started to become unbearableNot only me but other North_Korean elites were hopeful that because Kim_Jong Un had studied abroad and was young he might change the policy direction and modernize North_Korea he saidBut Kim soon showed his intention to continue his fathers pursuit of nuclear_weapons and his reluctance to introduce the economic reforms the impoverished country badly needsKim Jong_Un made it very clear that North_Korea should complete the path toward nuclear development Thae said This kind of policy is regarded by most North_Korean elites like me as very fanatical because it pushes North_Korea into a corner of self-destruction The doubts heightened after Kim had his uncle executed at the end of 2013 Although executions are not rare in North_Korea there was something disturbingly arbitrary about this one Thae saidStill he continued his duties in London with free housing health_care and educationBut at home Thaes younger son who was still in high school and hoped to study computer science at a top London university was asking why North_Korea doesnt allow the Internet why North_Koreans are not allowed to watch foreign films why North_Koreans cant read any books they wantAs a father it was hard for me to tell lies and it started a debate within the family Thae said This North_Korean system is a really inhuman system It even abuses the love between parents and their childrenSo last July after much preparation and as the end of his posting was approaching Thae escaped with his wife and both their sonsThae declined to discuss the specifics of how his family fled saying that giving away details could close off the escape route for other North_Korean officials abroadHis arrival in South_Korea was the most high profile of what is said to be a string of elite defections Last year the government in Seoul hinted that there had been numerous defections from the military and diplomatic service as well as among officials charged with raising money for Kim himselfThe South_Korean government and some analysts have portrayed the defections as signs of cracks in Kims regime which has endured despite repeated predictions of its imminent collapse A former intelligence official told The_Post that about 100 elite defectors have been debriefed at a secret residential center run by the governmentThere is no sense of solidarity or loyalty between Kim_Jong Un and senior officials Thae said Senior officials know that this system cant continueStill Thae described feeling shame about his previous role saying he was an actor who pretended to love the systemNow he is trying to fix that Ive decided to spend the rest of my_life meaningfully and I want to do something significant not just for my family but also my countryKim Jong_Nam the half_brother of the North_Korean leader died a very painful death within 20 minutes of having poison smeared on his face Malaysian authorities said SundayThis suggests he was exposed to an overwhelming amount of VX a nerve agent that is classified as a weapon of mass destruction S Subramaniam Malaysias health minister saidThe absorption level was so rapid that within a few_minutes the guy had symptoms Subramaniam told_reporters in Kuala_Lumpur Malaysias capital From the time of the onset he died within 15 to 20 minutesKim Jong_Nam the estranged older brother of North_Korean leader Kim_Jong Un was attacked in the busy Kuala_Lumpur airport on Feb 13 by two women who wiped a substance on his face and in his eyes They fled while their victim sought help but he died in an ambulance on the way to the hospitalMalaysian police said Friday that the autopsy showed Kim_Jong Nam died of exposure to VX a chemical weapon that can be absorbed through the skin or mucous membranes All suspicions about the attack rest with the regime in Pyongyang Malaysia has implicated eight North_Koreans including a diplomat said to be hiding in the North_Korean Embassy in Kuala_Lumpur and a scientist whom Malaysia has in custodySouth Korea has bluntly blamed the assassination on Kim_Jong Un accusing him of trying to eliminate potential rivals to his power while the for North_Korean diplomats who were to arrive in New_York this week for talks with former US officials The decision was made after Malaysia announced the finding of VXVX is banned under the international but North_Korea is not a signatory Pyongyang is thought to have the worlds third-largest stocks of chemical_weapons behind the United_States and Russia and is believed to have been pursuing VX according to the VX is a nerve agent that interferes with the workings of the major organs including the lungs leading to death by muscle paralysisThe muscle goes into a state of permanent contraction Subramaniam said The dose that the 45-year-old victim received was so high that his heart and lungs would have been affected quickly he said After the autopsy results and 11_days after the attack teams in hazmat suits swept the airport terminal for traces of VX or other toxins but found none and declared the terminal safeMembers of the medical staff who helped Kim are being monitored but none has shown symptoms Subramaniam saidQuestions are being raised about how the two women who carried_out the attack apparently without wearing gloves managed to survive Security camera footage shows them going to the bathroom immediately after the attack presumably to wash their handsSiti Aishah who is Indonesian and was reportedly the first to apply the oil-like substance to Kim_Jong Nam told police she vomited in a taxi after leaving the airport and continued to feel unwell She is being testedAishah has repeatedly told police that she was tricked into carrying out the attack she says she was told that it was a prank and was paid about $100 for taking part However the security footage shows the women acting with determination and immediately rushing off after the attack Malaysian authorities say that no one from Kim_Jong Nams family has come forward to claim his body They have been asking for a DNA match before releasing the body and there were reports last_week that his 22-year-old son had arrived from Macau but these turned out to be falseNorth Korea has angrily denounced every part of the investigation accusing the South_Korean government of persuading Malaysia to besmirch Pyongyangs reputation by laying the blame on itNorth Koreas ambassador in Kuala_Lumpur strongly objected to an autopsy being carried_out at all saying that the victim whom he did_not identify was carrying a diplomatic passport and was therefore not subject to Malaysian lawsMalaysia has however insisted that it will follow all usual procedures for investigating a suspicious deathNorth Korea shot a ballistic_missile startlingly close to Japan on Wednesday sparking stern condemnations from Tokyo Seoul and

Japan itself said Euan Graham who served_as a British diplomat in Pyongyang North_Koreas capital Its a clear case of walking right up to the line and just putting a nose over it said Graham now an East Asian security expert_at the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney Its a provocative actSouth Koreas Joint Chiefs of Staff and the US Strategic Command said they detected two simultaneous launches of Rodong intermediate-range ballistic_missiles from the North_Korean launch site in the southwest of the country shortly before 8 am local time WednesdayOne appeared to explode

Defense_(THAAD) system aimed_at intercepting North_Korean missiles is set to be deployed near the rural area of Seongju South_Korea some 200 miles southeast of Seoul by the end of next year The plan is controversial among residents in the area many of whom fear they will become a target for North KoreaPyongyang has called the THAAD battery vicious warmongering and has threatened a nuclear strike against the siteMeanwhile China views the deployment as a thinly disguised attempt to keep it in check Beijing seized on Wednesdays launch as further proof that the United_States plan to deploy the system was causing instability in the regionSouth Korea is putting the cart before the horse in their pursuit of national_security as the key to security lies in good neighborly and friendly relations with its neighbors rather_than a bunch of US-made missiles the Chinese state-run news_agency South_Korean military officials told_reporters in Seoul that Wednesdays launches the latest in a volley of

shorter-range Scud missiles last_month North_Korean state_media ran footage showing Kim_Jong Un sitting in front of maps that right down to the southern port city of Busan within rangeWith Wednesdays launches Pyongyang was signaling to Tokyo that it also had the capacity to strike Japan Graham noted And although North_Korea relies on the support of China the latest act will probably set alarm bells ringing in Beijing because it means the Chinese capital is also in rangeKims regime would almost certainly never hurl missiles toward China but its ability to do so could increase Beijings rationale for developing its own missile_defense system Graham said Fears about North_Koreas technical abilities have been mounting While some of North_Koreas recent missile_launches especially of the Musudan-type missile appear to have been failures analysts say that the Norths scientists are honing their technology with every testThe progress North_Korea is making might embolden the regime and encourage it to take even more incendiary action Tokyo said in its annual defense white paper released Tuesday North_Korea appeared to be making progress in its aim to make nuclear warheads capable of being carried to the mainland United_States it saidAmong US allies there was sharp condemnation Wednesday of North_Koreas latest defiance of The launch was an unforgivable act of aggression that represents a grave threat to the security of Japan said Prime_Minister Shinzo_Abe A spokesman for South_Koreas Unification Ministry called the missile_launch a serious provocation to South_Korea and the international communityThe Pentagon urged North_Korea to refrain from ratcheting up tensions in the region It should focus instead on taking concrete steps toward fulfilling its commitments and international obligations said Gary Ross a US Navy commanderBut analysts expect North_Korea to continue with missile_launches and other provocations over the next few weeks as South_Korea and the

North_Korean representatives to the United_States for talks with former American officials the first such meeting in more_than five_years and a sign that Pyongyang sees a potential opening with the Trump administrationArranging the talks has become a lot more complicated over the past eight days with North_Korea and the assassination of Kim_Jong Uns_half brother in Malaysia an act that many suspect was Malaysian police on Sunday named as suspects four North_Koreans who left the country on the day of the attackAnalysts also say they highly doubt that Pyongyang which has insisted on being recognized as a nuclear state would be willing to moderate its position on its weapons programIf the talks do take_place they could offer a glimmer of hope for an already-hostile relationship that has only deteriorated as the Kim government works aggressively to develop a nuclear-tipped missile_capable of reaching the continental United StatesThe planning for the Track 15 talks with the US side made up of the former officials who usually take part in Track 2 talks but the North_Korean side composed of government officials is still in a preparatory stage according to people with knowledge of the arrangementsThe State_Department has not approved the North_Koreans visas for the talks which would take_place in New_York within the next few weeksThe North_Koreans have expressed an interest in engagement but nothings been approved yet said one person_familiar with the preparations speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss them Others who have been in touch with North_Koreans describe an intense interest in what President Trump might doIf this happens it would be an interesting signal to the new administration one person said of the discussions The talks would be the clearest indication yet that Kim wants to talk with the Trump administration If this happens I would take it as a very positive sign from both_sides said another person with knowledge of the arrangementsIn recent years there have been sporadic Track 15 talks that have taken place in Kuala_Lumpur Geneva Berlin and Ulaanbaatar Mongolia But these talks have not taken place in the United_States since July 2011 before Kim succeeded his father in North KoreaThe planned talks are being organized by Donald S Zagoria of the National_Committee on American Foreign Policy who served_as a consultant on Asia during the Carter administration and has organized previous rounds of such talks Zagoria declined to comment on the preparationsThe talks would be run independently of the State_Department where officials have privately questioned the utility of such discussions But if the administration issued the visas it would be an implicit seal of approval And if the discussions go well they could pave the way for official talks Choe Son Hui the director of the US affairs department in North_Koreas Foreign_Ministry is likely to lead the delegation from PyongyangShe is well known to American officials having participated in official meetings including the six-party talks on denuclearization as well as in other Track15 talksChoe has a direct line to Kim according to Thae Yong Ho the North_Korean deputy ambassador to London who defected to South_Korea last_year Since Trump was elected there has been a notable change in North_Koreas usually bombastic rhetoricPyongyang had been sharply critical of the Obama_administration saying its policy of strategic patience waiting for North_Korea to change its nuclear calculations was an aggressive and heinous strategic suffocation policy against North KoreaBut in its announcement of its missile_launch Feb 12 the Norths state_media did_not include its usual bluster about needing a deterrent against the United_States and its hostile policiesIn his own statement after the launch Trump notably did_not condemn Pyongyang The new president has in fact said very little about how he plans to deal with North_Korea North_Korea well take care of it folks were going to take care of it all he said at his last_week without elaboratingHis administration is conducting a review of North_Korea policy This provides space to broaden the options for dealing with Pyongyang and an opportunity to influence the new president analysts sayWhile some expect him to take a hard-line approach encouraged by hawkish advisers others say that Trump who prides himself on making deals could be open to dialogue with the North_Korean regimeUS policy is hanging in the balance said Adam Cathcart an expert on North_Korea at the University of Leeds in BritainI think the North_Koreans ought to be pretty happy because the Americans have laid off criticizing them too_much and have in fact been making things quite easy for them Cathcart said But at some point they are going to have to decide whether to pick up the cudgel For those favoring an even tougher approach to North_Korea recent events have provided plenty of ammunitionOn Feb 12 North_Korea tested a ballistic_missile for the first time since Trump was elected The missile appeared to show significant technological advances with upgraded power and range and could mark another step in the push toward the capacity to hit Alaska or Washington stateThen on Feb 13 the estranged half_brother of the North_Korean leader was attacked and apparently poisoned at Kuala_Lumpur International Airport He died shortly afterwardAlthough the investigation is ongoing the South_Korean government has blamed the assassination on Kim_Jong Un who has eliminated potential rivals to his power over the past four yearsMalaysian police have arrested one North_Korean man in connection with the attack and on Sunday named four other North_Koreans suspected of being involvedThe four had been in Malaysia for several weeks but all left on the day of the attack said Noor Rashid Ibrahim Malaysias deputy national police chief on Sunday at a news conferenceComplicating the environment further the South_Korean and US militaries are due to start annual joint exercises next month an event that always elicits an angry response from Pyongyang which sees the drills as a pretext for an invasionIn the past_year or two the with the two militaries practicing decapitation strikes on the North_Korean leadershipAs ordinary North_Koreans have found ways to get information the state denies them soppy South_Korean dramas and peppy pop songs novels news from the outside_world so too has the Kim regime found news ways to crack down on them according to a new report released WednesdayThe regime has developed sophisticated new tools to check just what its citizens are up to according to Compromising Connectivity a new report from The report underlines the challenges in getting information into the most tightly controlled country on the planet and the challenges that North_Korea watchers as diverse as the US Congress and small defector-led groups face in trying to penetrate itIn a lot of ways the expansion of information is continuing said Nat Kretchun the lead author of the report which draws on interviews with 34 recent defectors from North_Korea Its just that we also see a lot of signs that the North_Korean government is gearing up to combat itKim Jong_Un his father and his grandfather have kept a tight grip on the North_Korean populace for more_than seven decades by denying citizens access to information State television radio and newspapers laud the work of the Kim family telling North_Koreans how lucky they are to live in such a strong and happy countryBut thanks to dramas smuggled in on USB sticks and illicit shortwave radio broadcasts from the outside an increasing number of North_Koreans have realized that their brethren in the South enjoy unimaginable levels of wealth and freedom Being caught with such banned media can result in harsh penalties including imprisonmentAt the same_time the introduction of cellphones albeit for domestic calls only and without Internet access is allowing people around the country to share information much more freely internally High-profile defectors such as who served_as a North_Korean diplomat in Europe for almost 20 years have described the transformative effect of outside information and have urged governments and NGOs to flood North_Korea with itWhile imposing new sanctions on North_Korea last_year Congress allocated $50million over the next five_years for radio programming and the promotion of freedom of information inside North KoreaBut the real picture is more complicated the Intermedia report saysTheyre clearly trying to innovate their way out of the breakdown of the security apparatus rather_than going back to Kim_Il Sung times Kretchun said referring to the founding president of the totalitarian state North_Koreas security apparatus began crumbling in the 1990s after a devastating famine that gave the regime no choice but to tolerate markets which then became a venue for sharing informationThey now have a vision of a more sophisticated but no less controlled media environment he saidTake cellphones North_Koreans are now allowed such devices including a re-branded Chinese Android-based smartphone called ArirangAs recently as 2013 North_Koreans could use these to share files including songs and text through Bluetooth or micro-storage SD cards But a mandatory software update rolled out in 2013 included a program called TraceViewer that would collect browsing history and take periodic screenshots of activity which the user could not delete That means the security services can see exactly what the user has been up to long after they have removed any SD card The update also included a signature system that would prevent a device from opening any files that dont bear a North_Korean state signature and in fact automatically deletes themEven with the network restrictions that were applied at the beginning cellphones could have been a game-changing device in North_Korea Kretchun said But the system update stops that from happeningNorth Korea has a unique advantage in that it can dictate what devices their people have he said He added that the state has made it very difficult for citizens to undermine their technology They put a lot of work into making sure you have to be quite technologically sophisticated to do the equivalent of jailbreaking these phonesAccess to outside networks has also been curtailed Residents on the border with China have been able to get signals on Chinese phones but the regime appears to have cracked down on this using jammers and signal detectorsOnce I went into a house and made a call to China and inspectors came within 30 seconds said a 59-year-old man who used to work for a trading company near the Chinese city of Dandong There are inspectors going around with an eavesdropping device to control calls to China he told the reports authors But North_Koreans are still able to watch movies and dramas at home relatively easilyPreviously they watched foreign movies and soap operas on DVDs smuggled into the country but in recent years they have developed a preference for USB sticks and SD cards which are easier to hide They plug the USBs or SD cards into their DVD players which are permitted although only to watch North_Korean propaganda and make_sure to have a DVD in the drive in case of a spot inspectionSmall portable DVD players called notels also are used for watching foreign dramasUsing small storage devices not only allows North_Koreans to hide them easily during raids but also enables them to share media with each other All but one of the North_Korean defectors Intermedia interviewed said they had shared content with othersDespite the challenges Kretchun said there was reason to keep trying to penetrate the North_Korean regimes information blockade Right now all the arrows continue to point up People are still certainly watching foreign dramas and listening to the radio he saidSometimes the men just wanted to talk with the North_Korean women Face cam its called But most of the time they wanted the other option body cam Watching through a smartphone app the men would ask the women some of the unknown thousands of North_Koreans sold to Chinese husbands and living secretly in northern China to show their breasts or their backsides to touch themselves or perform sex acts on one anotherMost of the time the women did as requested They needed the money even if it amounted to only a few dollars a dayIn the beginning I didnt think it was going to be a big deal I thought it would be okay because I wasnt actually sleeping with anyone said Suh who until dreams of escape brought her to this dingy room in Laos had been one of the legions of North_Korean women performing online sex work in back rooms in China But then I found out how many perverts there are out thereSuh a 30-year-old who escaped from North_Korea in 2008 resorted to doing video chatting after her second child was born and her husbands meager construction earnings wouldnt stretch any furtherThere are some people who just want to look at your face but the majority of them are there for their sexual desires Suh said putting her head down so her long hair covered her cherubic face I felt so disgustingTogether with two women from her village in northeastern China who were also doing chatting work Suh fled over the summer She made the heart-wrenching decision to leave her 5-year-old daughter with her Chinese husbandThe women traveled by bus and car down through China to the border with Laos which they crossed illegally in the black of night Suh carrying her 18-month-old daughter Ji-yeon on her backThe women made it to Vientiane the Laotian capital where a Washington_Post reporter spent two days with them as they paused on their journey to what they hoped would be a better life The women talked for hours about their lives in North_Korea and in China but unlike some defectors who exaggerate their stories to make them more sensational they appeared to play down their experiences apparently out of shame Most of their stories could be verified with the pastor and broker who were helping them escape and The women had a friend film them at work before they left so they could prove what they had been doing The videos showed the women sometimes in brightly colored underwear sometimes naked sitting against a low bed covered with a purple Hello Kitty quilt in front of two computers on a low table Men sometimes visible sometimes not gave them instructions Most of the men they chatted with online were in South_Korea but a few were in America and even AfricaSafely out of China the other two women both called Kim wanted to get to South_Korea but Suh had her heart set on a more ambitious destination the United_States the strongest country on EarthI think my daughter is one lucky baby Suh said sitting on the bed in a grimy room in Vientiane and looking at Ji-yeon as she slept snoring lightly Their few possessions were in plastic shopping bags save for the clothes drying on coat hangers dangling from the light fittings The baby had not even one toy All the suffering is worth it Our destiny has changed Suh saidDefections such as that of who fled to South_Korea over the summer make headlines because they are so rare But less sensationally a steady if diminishing stream of North_Koreans is making their way out down through China across to Laos then into Thailand and eventually to South KoreaMost are women from the northern provinces considered down-and-out even by North_Korean standards and face an extremely precarious life in northeastern China Many had been sold some knowingly thinking life couldnt get any worse But other women had been tricked into thinking they were heading to jobs in China only to find that the man who offered to help them escape paying bribes to border soldiers and arranging passage turned out to be a trafficker selling the women and pocketing the profitsThe buyers are men in the countryside who are too poor or unappealing to get a wife any other way and the women are stuck in remote villages where they cannot communicate with the locals if they are permitted to leave the house that isSince Kim_Jong Un took control of North_Korea at the end of 2011 security has been tightened and it has become increasingly difficult to escape That has driven up prices Women ages 15 to 25 are the most prized fetching between $10000 and $12000 brokers and humanitarian workers say while women in their 30s can be acquired for half thatIncreased prices mean that some Chinese families are spending their entire life savings to buy a North_Korean woman and as a result the women are sometimes shackled inside the houseBut even if the women are allowed out and even after they learn some Chinese venturing into the open is a risky business If theyre caught by the Chinese police they face repatriation to North_Korea and at a minimum time in a labor campThese North_Korean women in China faced a dire dilemma either having to remain hidden and submit to this kind of sexual exploitation or risk working outside of their residence with the very real possibility that Chinese authorities could arrest them at any time and force them back to North_Korea said Phil Robertson of Human Rights WatchThe State Departments noted that North_Korean women and girls are subjected to sexual slavery by Chinese or Korean-Chinese men forced prostitution in brothels or through Internet sex sites or compelled service as hostesses in nightclubs or karaoke barsThe State_Department reported that the Chinese government does_not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking however it is making significant efforts to do soAlthough some women take the risk of working outside the home or working behind the scenes in restaurants an increasing number feel they have no choice but to try to make money behind closed doorsThat is where video chatting comes in About one-fifth of the North_Korean women living in hiding in China are involved in this kind of online sex work said Park a broker who works to get women outThe Post agreed to withhold Parks full name to avoid jeopardizing this highly sensitive work The newspaper also agreed to use the womens family names only partly to protect relatives in North KoreaIf youre working in a restaurant or outside you run the risk of being asked for your papers by the police So doing this work is safer and the money is better Park said In the village where they lived every North_Korean woman does this Its so normal to be doing thisSome North_Korean women in China are forced into this work essentially held prisoner by pimps The women The_Post met were not forced as such But they had few other opportunitiesSuh was sold eight years_ago to a man in northern China who she said treated her well he beat her only a few times But the arrival of their second child made a tough financial situation untenable She heard about video chatting through a friend of a friend and began chatting with South_Korean men at night when everyone in her house was asleepOn her first day she earned $3 In her best week she netted $120A few months_ago Suh decided she couldnt take it I wondered why I had to do this Im a human being the same as everyone else Suh said breaking down into heaving sobs I wanted to be a good mother a strong mother for my daughters She decided to try to leave along with the two others They found out about Park and Kim Sung-eun a pastor from the Caleb Mission a church in South_Korea that helps bring defectors to safety and asked to be helped out For the second time in their lives they escaped this time to a safe house in northern China and from there they made the journey to the border then walked to LaosI was so scared but I kept on going I just kept on going Suh said I kept walking toward Pastor Kim and ParkLaos was safer but still somewhat of a gray area they may be sent back Once they got to Thailand the fear of repatriation to North_Korea would be goneWhile waiting to cross the Mekong River the women talked about the difficult decisions they had had to make Suhs 5-year-old is listed on her Chinese fathers family register which gives her legal status in China and enables her to go to school But by the time Ji-yeon was born the back channel for registration involving bribes to willing officials had closed The baby doesnt legally existSo when Suh decided to flee and realized she could only manage to take one child with her she knew it had to be Ji-yeon She thinks Ive abandoned her Suh said breaking down into another torrent of tears as she recalled telling her older daughter she would be back soonThe day they were to cross into Thailand the women were full of nervous excitement But things soon went wrong Heavy rain had swollen the Mekong and their boat missed the drop pointThey were discovered by local police and taken to a prison They were terrified and sent an endless stream of messages to Park asking if they would be sent back to North_Korea One photo they sent showed Ji-yeon standing in a cell looking out through the bars Instead they were taken to Bangkok where they are now being held at a detention center the pastor saidSuh has applied for asylum in the United_States even though she speaks no English and knows she will receive little support unlike in South_Korea Officials from the American Embassy in Bangkok have met with Suh and her daughter the pastor said He estimated that it would take about four months for their asylum claims to be processedAn embassy spokeswoman in Bangkok declined to comment The United_States has accepted 74 refugees from North_Korea since Kim took power according to State_Department dataDuring the pause in Vientiane the relief of being out of China had washed over the women and the challenges ahead loomed The women had begun to dwell on the handicaps that North_Koreans face I have no passport no papers nothing Suh said Why are our lives so different just because of where we are bornSEOUL The Moranbong Band is back North_Koreas famous girl band had not been seen since without playing a song in December on what was supposed to be their first concert abroadWith their short skirts and high heels whose members were chosen directly by Kim_Jong Un is considered North_Koreas answer to the manufactured saccharine girl bands that have come out of South_Korea in recent yearsThere were multiple theories swirling about their sudden departure from Beijing in December ranging from the Chinese authorities being annoyed at the amount of pro-Kim propaganda in their performance to rumors one of the women tried to defect Some said the concert was too close to the anniversary of former leader Kim_Jong Ils death although that seemed unlikely since authorities on both_sides knew that date was coming upBut this week on the anniversary of his fathers birth and a week after the countrys Kim_Jong Un has been holding a range of celebrations There was a huge banquet and concert for those involved in this months launch of Kwangmyongsong-4 which North_Korea says is a space launch vehicle that put a satellite into_orbit but which pretty much everyone else views as cover for its ballistic_missile programParty time Kim_Jong Un holds a banquet/concert to celebrate rocket launch - Anna Fifield (@annafifield) Heres what Kim said according to the official Korean_Central News AgencyThe course of conquering space was for the purpose of the revolution and independence rather_than for that of science and it was a fierce struggle to defend the peace and sovereignty from the hostile forces as well as to implement the behests of the great leaders Todays great success was recorded as a glorious page in the history of our Party and country as it gave confidence and courage to our people and dealt a telling blow to the enemies seeking to block the advance of our countryThe reports showed photos of banquet buffet tables complete with huge models of the rocketBut the star of the show was the girl group which performed a number of songs that were broadcast on North_Korean television on WednesdayTheir return was announced in a simple sentence at the end of At the banquet there was a performance of the Moranbong Band celebrating the successful launch of satellite Kwangmyongsong-4 the report saidKim Jong_Uns wife Ri Sol Ju also appeared at the event the first time shes shown up in official media this yearThe textile factories producing made in China goods from compounds just across the Yalu River from North_Korea offer a glimpse into a hidden world that is helping North_Koreas economy to thriveOperated by North_Koreans the factories produce clothes and other goods that are exported under foreign-company labels making it impossible to tell that they have been made with North_Korean hands and have contributed to North_Korean profitsThe thriving operations belie the perception in Washington that US and international sanctions are working to strangle North_Koreas ability to make money While an overwhelming majority of North_Koreans live in poverty the countrys output has been steadily increasing and an estimate by South_Koreas forecasts that the Norths economy will grow this year by a whopping 7percentA lot of that growth comes through Dandong a hive of North_Korean and Chinese managers and traders with middlemen helping them all cover their tracks One local Chinese businessman estimates that one-quarter of this citys population of 800000 is involved in doing business with North_Korea in some wayIn one factory on a recent day dozens of North_Korean women sat under fluorescent strip lights sewing seams and pressing pockets on pants some of which were destined for the United StatesThey are here to make money for the country a North_Korean factory manager said of the workersThis scene is repeated in dozens perhaps hundreds of labor compounds all along the border which in effect is little more_than a line on the map The extensive range of commercial activity suggests that it would be wrong to think that Chinas leadership is now so annoyed with Kim_Jong Un who took control of North_Korea at the end of 2011 after the death of his father that it is tightening the economic screws on the young leader next doorThis is a very sensitive part of China during a week of reporting along the North_Korean border Washington_Post reporters were monitored by police and doing business with North_Korea is a very sensitive subject The textile-factory manager would allow himself to be identified only as Mr Kim he and other North_Korean businessmen who agreed to speak about their operations otherwise did so on the condition of anonymity for fear of jeopardizing their livelihoodsNorth Koreas economy is still a basket case barely more_than one-fiftieth the size of South_Koreas But in talking_about the changes underway the businessmen described a North_Korean economy that is increasingly run according to market principles where people want to be in business not the bureaucracy and where money talksMr Kim the textile manager said he has no qualms about making pants to be worn by men going to work in imperialist aggressor countries such as the United_States South_Korea or Japan the three most hated enemies of his country He was only interested he said in maximizing profits for Pyongyang wherever they come fromIt doesnt matter whether theyre an enemy country or not Kim saidIn the clothing factory the women work 13 hours a day 28 or 29 days a month and are paid $300 each a month one-third of which they keep The rest goes back to the government in PyongyangEven though I want to pay them more I have to send a certain amount home to my country so this is all I can give them Kim said in his office at the factory On his desk an open laptop revealed that visitors had interrupted his game of solitaireThe women work on the third floor wearing their coats inside to guard against the cold and live on the second floor in shared dormitory-style rooms decorated with a banner declaring Lets realize the revolutionary ideas of Kim_Il Sung and Kim_Jong Il alongside portraits of the two former leaders grandfather and father respectively of Kim_Jong Un Signs on the doors read Call each other comradeNorth Korea is thought to have at_least 50000 workers outside the country earning money for the regime and 13000 of them work in DandongThis neon explosion of a city contrasts starkly with the North_Korean city of Sinuiju on the opposite bank of the river where there is only a smattering of light at nightBut there are signs of large-scale construction on the North_Korean side a half-completed apartment tower with a crane on the top and other new buildings underway Although the traffic crossing the bridge between the two cities is far from jammed it is constant A steady flow of vans and container trucks and the occasional black sedan with tinted windows crossed in both directions over the course of a weekPassenger and freight trains ran regularly carrying cargo such as steel bars for construction and unrefined gold dirtConsumer goods go in the other direction The most popular items to sell in North_Korea these days are TV sets hooked up to solar panels preferably with USB ports for watching smuggled dramasHere North_Koreans are coming to grips with the fundamentals of capitalism even if they still wont use the termOver dinner one night at a Chinese restaurant another North_Korean factory manager happily chatted about his corporate role models Chief among them the titans of South_Korean conglomerates such as Samsung and Hyundai who propelled that countrys rapid economic transformationWhat had he learned from those tycoons in the SouthPerseverance the need to diversify said the businessman who manages a factory that produces goods related to the construction industry and was sporting a Tissot watch Were living in a world where new things keep appearing Who would have thought Nokia would have collapsed Their mistake was sticking with the same productHe has absorbed some of these lessons from the outside_world describing steps he has taken to increase productivity at his factory mainly by creating better working conditions so his employees want to work more and boost his profitsThis is emblematic of the tentative economic experimentation taking place since Kim_Jong Un became leaderReports from inside North_Korea suggest that even state-run companies are increasingly operated according to market principles with managers empowered to hire and fire workers previously unimaginable in the communist nation and conduct businesses the way they see bestThere are frustrations here The biggest one literally has to be the four-lane $350million New Yalu River Bridge a huge steel structure that traverses the river from a glitzy urban development Dandong New DistrictThe whole development project is now on ice partly because of the the businessman and uncle of Kim_Jong Un who was executed at the end of 2013 partly because of his decadent capitalist lifestyle Since then Jangs colleagues have been recalled to Pyongyang or have disappeared sometimes with millions of dollars in Chinese money according to businessmen hereBeijing is clearly none too happy about this and smaller Chinese operators also have complaints about dealing with North KoreaOne Korean Chinese businessman named Ri who exports raw materials from North_Korea said there are lots of fraudsters thereSometimes the North_Korean takes the money but then you cant find the person he said As the middleman I have to take responsibility for that There are some people here whove committed suicide because theyve lost everythingA well-to-do Chinese couple who run an exporting business in Dandong she was carrying a Chanel bag he had an Armani sweater could barely conceal their distaste for the state across the river They used to export kitchen goods to North_Korea but have stopped saying it was too hard to make money thereAsked if they had seen signs that North_Korea is opening up its economy the woman said Oh youre so naiveI havent seen any signs of that her_husband chimed in We built this whole new bridge but North_Korea hasnt built anythingBut while the political chill between North_Korea and China might have had an impact on state-level economic cooperation and those who played in the big leagues with Jang might have been scared away there are still plenty of small businessmen looking for and finding ways to make moneyThese guys are out there to make a buck theyre not the World Food Program and as long as these opportunities exist private profit-seeking market-conforming trade and investment will_continue said Marcus Noland an expert on the North_Korean economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in WashingtonTake Zhang a Korean Chinese merchant who runs one of the 30 or so Chinese businesses in Dandong that ship fabric to North_Korea to be turned into clothes there for European companies Zhang said that he employs a few dozen people on the Chinese side of the border but that his workforce in North_Korea fluctuates between 3000 and 10000 people depending on how many orders he hasNorth Koreans are particularly good at painstaking manual work such as lace-making and hand-stitched beadwork He pulls out his smartphone and shows a photo of a blond woman wearing an intricately embroidered pink and white dress a product of North_Korean laborZhang who speaks Korean and Chinese does_not even need his passport to enter North_Korea He has a permit that allows him to travel back and forth freely He talked about how hes developed good relations with his business partners thereOver the past few years Ive built trust with the North_Koreans he said Every year around the birthdays of the leaders I go there in person and take fruit and flower baskets I pay my respects to the leaders and Im sure my clients report this back to the authoritiesFor North_Koreans who make money on the Chinese side of the border one question is how to get it back to PyongyangSince the start of the Korean War in 1950 when it included North_Korea in the Trading With the Enemy Act the United_States has sought to restrict North_Koreas ability to bank and tradeThis has tightened markedly over the past decade with the United_States imposing rounds of sanctions designed to curtail North_Koreas ability to procure materials for its nuclear_weapons program by shutting the country out of the international financial system The latest measures were imposed in January as punishment for the The restrictions hurt at first But North_Korea has wised up It uses small banks in China or Russia to transfer money several banks in Dandong said it was possible to wire money to Pyongyang for a hefty commission or simply reverts to old-fashioned suitcases full of cash which are much harder to stop with sanctionsThere is a sense in Dandong that sanctions are an issue for Washington and Beijing but that they dont apply here on the borderIm just a local businessman Zhang said adding that sanctions apply to big international companies not to private individuals like us clearly considering his business with North_Korea domestic Anyway we find ways to get around themRi the Korean Chinese trader said that his business partners always want cashSo they come out or I go into North_Korea to settle the bills he said in his office in Dandong running wooden beads through his fingers They like to be paid in US dollars euros Japanese yen (North Koreans returning to Pyongyang apparently like to carry American dollars for the cachet)Everyone interviewed said that it is entirely possible to send cash to North_Korea people usually just carry it in bags over the bridge and that while there might technically be limits on how_much a person can carry in practice there are no checks or at_least no checks that cannot be overcome by greasing a few palmsBut the regime doesnt always want cash The North_Korean businessmen who talked to The_Post said they buy goods according to orders from Pyongyang and ship those back instead Recently they have been asked to send back solar panels and generators to help deal with North_Koreas chronic electricity shortageRelations between China and North_Korea are complicated but one thing is clear Politics and economics are not entirely intertwinedThere is a lot of jumping to conclusions in Washington and discussion about China showing a strong hand to North_Korea said John Park a North_Korea sanctions expert_at MIT I dont see the evidence for thatAlthough trade appears to have dipped recently that is the result of sharp declines in prices of commodities such as coal and iron ore two of North_Koreas biggest exports to China rather_than some kind of punishment for Kims lack of deference to Xi_Jinping the Chinese presidentThe young North_Korean leader has not made the traditional pilgrimage to visit the states patronBut pragmatic China Park said does_not want North_Korea becoming unstable and risk unsettling this precarious northeastern part of ChinaAs you must have watched lots of historic soap operas in South_Korea you will know that China and North_Korea are like lips and teeth said the North_Korean factory manager over dinner repeating an old saying about the neighbors Economically nothing has changed Yoonjung_Seo and Hallie Gu

to dress conservatively in North_Korea so people like going to the gym so they can show off their bodies show some skin said Lee Seo-hyeon a 24-year-old who was until 18 months_ago part of Pyongyangs brat packWomen like to wear leggings and tight tops Elle is the most popular brand among women while men prefer Adidas and Nike she said When young people go to China they travel armed with shopping lists from their friends for workout gearAt a leisure complex next to the bowling alley in the middle of Pyongyang they run on the treadmills which show Disney cartoons on the monitors or do yogaThe complex also has a fancy restaurant that advertises for wedding functions glitzy venues cost as much as $500 an hour and a coffee shop where most drinks are priced between $4 and $8 although an iced mocha costs $9Its a cool spot When youre in there it feels like you could be anywhere in the world said Andray Abrahamian who is British and helps run an exchange program that provides financial training to North_Koreans He recently played squash on one of the three courts at the center Its not cheap Its a few dollars for a class Its definitely for people who have disposable incomeNorth Korea as a whole remains economically backward industry has all but collapsed and even in Pyongyang the official salary remains less_than $10 a month but the rise in recent years of a merchant class has created a whole layer of nouveaux riches in the capital city Donju or masters of money have emerged with the tentative moves toward becoming a market economy that began about 15 years_ago but has picked up momentum under Kim_Jong Un the third-generation leader who took over the reins of North_Korea at the end of 2011The donju usually hold official government positions in ministries or the military running state businesses abroad or trying to attract investment into North_Korea On the side they trade in everything they can get their hands on including flat-screen TVs and apartmentsThe money that they are making now flows through society through the markets that are present in every population center to the high-end restaurants of PyongyangKim Jong_Un is very pro-market His policy has essentially been benign neglect said Andrei Lankov a Russian historian specializing in Korea who once studied in Pyongyang A number of North_Korean capitalists Ive talked to say that theyve never had it so goodKim 33 has made it a high priority to improve the lives of his fellow millennials in particular He has ordered the construction of amusement parks and water parks and skate parks even a dolphinarium and a ski resort Around the capital volleyball and tennis courts are full of young peopleOn a trip to Pyongyang this month three Washington_Post reporters went to a German-themed restaurant near the Juche Tower that had exposed brick walls and seven kinds of North_Korean beer on tap A huge screen showed ice skatingOn the menu there was a prime steak with a baked potato for $48 although the Wiener schnitzel was more reasonable at $7 Most of the North_Koreans in the restaurant seemed to be opting for the local food although at $7 for a bowl of bibimbap the price youd pay in Seoul it was hardly cheapAt the Sunrise complex theres a sushi bar and a barbecue restaurant where groups of North_Koreans were enjoying grilled meat the waitress recommended cuts of beef that were $50 for a one-person portion and bottles of soju Koreans favorite alcoholic beverage on a recent Saturday nightA North_Korean couple pulled the bamboo curtain across the front of their table when they heard foreigners arrive In Pyonghattan discretion is key If it werent for the little badges they could be South Koreans said one expat in Pyongyang referring to the pins of Kim_Il Sung or Kim_Jong Il the first two generations of leaders that North_Koreans must wear over their hearts Theyre paying 10 to 15 euros for a meal he said He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the trouble his remarks could cause for himThere are other signs that more people have more disposable income Five or six taxi companies are operating although the drivers grumble that business isnt great and a reporter spotted several people with pet dogs something that wouldnt have been seen a few years agoWomen perhaps seeing a green light from Ri Sol Ju Kims fashionable wife have started wearing brighter

their phones and show you photosA fancy supermarket stocked with imported products was selling Australian beef Norwegian salmon craft beer and granola all at astronomical prices The store was empty when The_Post visited at 8 on a Saturday evening but others who have visited said they have seen Koreans shopping thereUntil last_year Lee Seo-hyeon and her brother Lee Hyeon-seung now 30 were part of this privileged setThey lived in China and went to a university there Their father a high-ranking North_Korean official based in China was tasked with earning foreign currency for the regime But they traveled back and forth to PyongyangLee Hyeon-seung described his teenage life in Pyongyang one that involved listening to Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys in the days before the South_Korean wave of K-pop and schmaltzy dramas had arrivedFor the average Pyonghattanite fast fashion from such brands as Uniqlo Zara and H&M is affordable and popular All my friends lived abroad and everyone would bring stuff like this back Lee Hyeon-seung saidBut there were limits Sleeveless tops and too-short skirts are out as is hair dyeIf your clothes are too radical or extreme or theyre not in line with North_Korean style the police might take your name and then your name will be broadcast on the radio Lee Seo-hyeon said The siblings defected together with their mother and high-ranking father to South_Korea in 2014 and they now are in Northern Virginia hoping to go to college in Washington this fallPlastic surgery already commonplace in the South has come to Pyongyang Double-eyelid operations to give Asian eyes a more Western look are derigeur as are nose jobs Doing your eyelids costs between $50 and $200 depending on the skill of the surgeonYou can get a visa to leave the country for medical reasons but plastic surgery is not considered a valid medical reason Lee Seo-hyeon said Being beautiful and being handsome are considered a competitive advantage But how_much of the change is skin-deep and how_much is realSo much of this development is about image Abrahamian said One woman who took part in his training program started a coffee shopThe coffee shops dont make much money Its just a signifier that youre fancy and cosmopolitan he saidOne of the most obvious changes has been the construction boom in the capitalThe high-rise apartment buildings that have popped up in the center of Pyongyang from the Changjon complex near Kim_Il Sung Square to the Mirae Scientists Street look impressive from a distanceBut up close tiles are falling off buildings that are only a year old and electricity supply remains so patchy that the most-sought-after apartments are the ones on the lower stories Who wants a 20th-floor walk-upWith the Mirae Scientists Street complete Kim has ordered the development of Ryomyong Street named for the place where the dawn breaks in the Korean revolutionKim said the area would contain magnificent skyscrapers one is planned to rise 70 stories with eco-friendly design incorporating solar panels and greenhousesThese may all be part of a Potemkin village but they nonetheless underscore the fact that in North_Korea poverty is no_longer equally sharedThere is only one game in town said Lankov the historian CapitalismKim Jong_Un the third generation of North_Koreas ruling dynasty boasted Friday of magnificent and exhilarating advances in nuclear and missile capabilities this year as he convened the in his lifetimeThe congress the first held since 1980 three years before Kim was born essentially amounts to an extravagant state-choreographed spectacle built around Kims leadershipThe intent was clear with each round of rapturous applause for the 33-year-old leader a display of loyalty and bolstered legitimacy for his rule even as North_Koreas defiant policies bring further isolation and pressures But Kim wasted no time in taking another swipe His bravado was aimed directly at the international_community amid alarm over the Norths attempts at military and nuclear expansionIn this year of the seventh party congress the military and the people have accomplished great success in the first hydrogen_bomb test and the launch of an Earth observation satellite to brilliantly illuminate the prowess of Juche Korea Kim said referring to North_Koreas unique ideology that translates as self-relianceUnprecedented results have been accomplished Kim wearing a Western-style suit and tie instead of his usual Mao suit told a packed audience in the ostentatious April 25 House of Culture in central PyongyangKim ordered North_Koreas fourth_nuclear test in January an event he hailed as historic in Fridays address Pyongyang claimed to have tested an exponentially more powerful hydrogen_bomb but outside analysts said it appeared to have been a lesser atomic device similar to the Norths previous test In February Kim then oversaw the launch of what authorities said was a rocket intended to put a satellite into_orbit but outside analysts widely believe to be part of an_intercontinental ballistic_missile program aimed_at enabling North_Korea to potentially strike the continental United_States But other launches since including two intermediate-range missile_launches and another from a submarine were deemed by the United_States and South_Korea to have failed There was no mention of this in Kims triumphant address howeverStill Kims boasts seem to prove the theory that this years provocations from the nuclear and missile_tests to threats to blow up New_York and Washington were part of an effort to bolster the young leaders legitimacyHe followed the general outline of arent we great and paying tribute to his father and grandfather and to the Workers_Party leadership said Michael Madden who runs the blog He was saying we have a strong and prosperous fatherland and were not going to be bullied by big countriesThe authorities in Pyongyang allowed in about 130 foreign journalists including three from The Washington_Post to cover the event apparently wanting to make_sure their message was disseminated to a wide audience But the journalists were not permitted to enter the building where the congress was being held Friday and were instead deposited by their government minders on a street corner some 300 yards from the red-festooned venueAfter an hour they were taken back to their hotel where state television was running dramas centered on revolutionary heroes Even as the congress continued across town the journalists were then taken to an electrical cable factoryIt wasnt until 10 pm that news of the congress was shown on television with Kims speech and the orchestrated cheering supplemented with photos of Kim in a variety of military situations looking happyDetails remain scarce It is not clear when the congress will end or what else will be on the agenda Thousands of people have been on the streets of Pyongyang in the rain practicing for a torchlight parade but no date for the event has been givenNorth Korea has placed huge importance on the congress Previous such events have served_as forums to show the ruling partys strength and have occasionally been used as vehicles for major announcements Kim_Il Sung the eternal president of North_Korea and the grandfather of the current leader used the 1980 congress to unveil his son Kim_Jong Il as his successor Kim_Il Sung died in 1994 and Kim_Jong Il in 2011Following in his grandfathers footsteps Kim_Jong Un has elevated the status of the Workers_Party and has effectively moved away from the military first policy promoted by his father by announcing a simultaneous push toward both nuclear and economic_development Analysts say that by calling the congress Kim is continuing this pattern of increasing the stature of the party while at the same_time bolstering his claim on the leadership North_Korea is home to the worlds only communist dynasty and Kim_Jong Un was not even 30 when he became its third-generation leaderKorean culture is Confucian and places a premium on age and seniority but Kim is a good half-century younger than some of his advisers The regime also was unable to lay the kind of groundwork for the current leader that it did for Kim_Jong IlKim Jong_Il was in the public eye moving through a series of official positions for more_than two_decades before he took the reins after Kim_Il Sungs death But there was barely more_than a year between the announcement of Kim_Jong Un as successor and his accession to the North_Korean throneAs a result few analysts were expecting bold initiatives to be unveiled at this congress given the difficulty the Kim regime has had making good on many of its promises Instead they were expecting pronouncements about the strength of the partyThe authorities here had instituted a to prepare for the congress requiring all citizens to work from 530 am until well after dark seven days a week painting buildings paving roads and planting gardens Streets have been decorated with banners and red Workers_Party flags and thousands of people have been practicing for paradesis investigating allegations by two women who said the head of its news department made unwanted physical contact with them while he was employed by another news organization nearly two_decades agoThe women both journalists at the time of the alleged incidents made the accusations in recent_weeks against senior vice_president of news and editorial director at the Washington-based public broadcasting organizationIn response to the allegations NPR said Tuesday that it has placed Oreskes on indefinite leaveIn separate complaints the women said Oreskes at the time the Washington bureau chief of the abruptly kissed them while they were speaking with him about working at the newspaper Both of them told similar stories After meeting Oreskes and discussing their job prospects they said he unexpectedly kissed them on the lips and stuck his tongue in their mouths Both of the women spoke to The Washington_Post on the condition of anonymity so as not to damage their employment prospectsThe alleged incidents occurred in the late 1990s the women said Oreskes after working at the Times and the Associated Press in senior editing rolesThe women spoke with NPRs attorney in charge of labor and employment matters in mid-October She sent the women emails acknowledging that the news organization was looking into the information they providedNPR didnt address any of the specific allegations when contacted by The_Post for comment Instead it issued a statement reading We take these kinds of allegations very seriously If a concern is raised we review the matter promptly and take appropriate steps as warranted to assure a safe comfortable and productive work environment As a matter of policy we do not comment about personnel matters A spokeswoman Isabel Lara offered no further comment Oreskes didnt respond to multiple requests for commentThe 63-year-old editor is the latest media figure whose conduct has been called into question by women who worked for him or who sought employment when he was in a position to wield power over hiring and firing Allegations against former New Republic editor Leon Wieseltier and political journalist Mark Halperin have also come to light in the past monthBoth complainants say Oreskess alleged behavior had a lasting impactOne of the women said her encounter with him permanently damaged her confidence She was in her late 20s at the time recently arrived in Washington from a small Western town When I first went to see him it was after screwing up my nerve to try to be bold and maneuver myself into a better job and after what_happened with him I never really tried that again she saidThe women said they met with Oreskes after he expressed an interest in reviewing their work and giving them career advice possibly with an eye toward hiring them as reporters Neither was ever hiredThe first woman said she met Oreskes at the Times offices in the Army and Navy Club Building in downtown Washington Afterward she said he took out a personal ad in the Washington City Paper aimed_at her It read Saw you at the Army-Navy Building Loved hearing your life story and your ideas Hope you get this message Let_me knowShe recounted that a week later he emailed her to ask why she hadnt responded to his ad The woman said she was unaware of it and had to search for it What was especially creepy about it was that he put it in the wrong place in the paper she said in an interview Instead of appearing in the Missed Connections section the ad was in a section called Adult Services that featured thinly disguised offers of prostitutionThereafter she said Oreskes invited her to have lunch in a room at the Watergate Hotel catered by room service She declined the offerShe nevertheless maintained contact with him hoping to keep her job prospects alive She says that when she mentioned to him that she was traveling to New_York for a job interview at the New_York Daily News he told her to book the flight he planned to take the same day They shared a cab into the city from the airport At the end of the trip he leaned against her kissed her and slipped his tongue into her mouth she saidThe worst part of my whole encounter with Oreskes wasnt the weird offers of room service lunch or the tongue kiss but the fact that he utterly destroyed my ambition she saidThe second woman recounted a similar sequence of events After booking him on a TV program that she was producing and mentioning that she wanted to return to print reporting he offered to review her published work They agreed to meet at a local restaurant but at the last minute Oreskes called and said he had a trip planned that day and was running late He asked to meet at her apartment She agreedThe apartment meeting went off without issue although the woman recalled feeling uncomfortable when Oreskes placed his hand in the small of her back as she showed him around her apartment She then offered to drive him to Reagan National Airport for his flight As she pulled to the curb Oreskes said goodbye then kissed her unexpectedly she saidI was frozen she recalled I was shocked I thought What just happened She said she drove 100 feet pulled over and called her boyfriend to tell him about the incidentLater she said she got a voice-mail message from Oreskes saying how_much he enjoyed meeting her and that he looked forward to seeing her againAbout two months later she booked him on the TV program again and invited him to lunch She arranged to meet him at a restaurant in the center of Union Station I looked him in the eye and I said You kissed me and it was totally inappropriate Thats not the way I want to get ahead in this business His jaw dropped He said I was overcome with passion I couldnt help myselfNeither woman complained at the time both believed that their complaints would be ignored and would jeopardize any chance of working for the TimesBoth said they were motivated to come forward now by NPRs coverage of recent sexual harassment episodes especially those involving The idea that hes in charge of that coverage is just so hypocritical to me one woman said Its sickening I want to say You owe me a public apology You should recuse yourself from NPRs coverage of harassment Two people who worked at the Times with Oreskes around the late 1990s recalled that he focused extraordinary attention on another young woman who worked as a news aide in the Washington bureau I would call it pestering said one editor It made [the woman] really nervous There was excessive phone calling [by him to her] and messages that he wanted to meet her outside the officeThis account was confirmed by Jill Abramson who was Oreskess deputy at the time Abramson who went on to become and is now a columnist and said in an interview that she regretted not confronting Oreskes about his behaviorIf I had to do it again I would have told him to knock it off said Abramson about the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill harassment case I_think I should have raised this with [the Times human resources department] Maybe confronting him would have somehow stopped him from doing it to another womanAbramson said she hesitated in part because the young woman didnt want to raise the issue but did want Oreskess alleged behavior to stop But Abramson said I dont really feel it was in a gray area in retrospect I should have stopped himThe Times takes all allegations of sexual harassment seriously and we are looking into it a spokeswoman for the company saidEventually another editor passed the word to a senior editor in New_York who gave Oreskes a father-son talking-to as one editor put it warning him to steer clear of the young woman The young woman eventually landed a job at another publication in WashingtonOne of the women who complained about Oreskes to NPR said she thought she saw him a few months_ago at her gym for the first time in years I just about had a heart attack she said I fled the building feeling sick Im not sure I would want to talk to him long enough for him to apologize even if he wanted toThe latest Republican health-care bill to repeal the Affordable_Care Act would eliminate funds for fundamental public_health programs including for the prevention of bioterrorism and as well as money to provide immunizations and heart-disease screeningsAs part of the the Prevention and Public Health Fund provides almost $1 billion annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Since 2010 the fund has been an increasingly important source of money for core CDC programs today accounting for about 12 percent of the CDCs total budgetThe GOP bill would starting in October of next year No clear replacement has been proposedThis is about protecting Americans so this is about saving lives Anne Schuchat acting CDC director said in an interview Tuesday referring to the proposed elimination of the fund She and other public_health experts held a briefing at the Capitol on Tuesday on the growing threat of An outbreak can happen anywhere she said Its not a red- or blue-state kind of thing And we want to sustain the defense of Americans health from these new emerging threatsThe CDCs former director Tom Frieden said that if the prevention funding is lost Americans will be at greater risk from vaccine-preventable disease food-borne infections and deadly infections contracted in hospitals Most of the prevention and public_health funds are sent to state and local health departments with more_than $625 million distributed among the 50 states and the District of Columbia last_year Public-health-advocacy groups and state and local public_health officials are warning the Trump administration and Congress of what they describe as the disastrous consequences of eliminating the fund without a corresponding budget increase to compensate for the lossState and local public_health officials plan to meet with members of Congress and administration officials this week to make the case for continued investments in public_health and prevention Cuts in those funds combined with potential federal budget cuts at the CDC and other health agencies could amount to a catastrophic year for public_health funding according to a statement from the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials which represents US public_health agenciesMore than 500 public_health organizations childrens advocacy groups universities and local health departments sent to President Trump last_week warning of the consequences of eliminating the prevention fund Advocates and public_health officials are hopeful that the money will be replaced but there have been few indications that that is forthcomingWe havent heard that expressed by the leadership either in the House or Senate said John Auerbach president and chief_executive of the Trust for Americas Health a public-health-advocacy organization that led the letter-writing effortMost of the attention of the ACA repeal has been on he saidBut if the CDC loses close to $1 billion in prevention funding we will see the loss of very important services that Americans in every city and town across the country have come to rely upon Auerbach saidAmong the personnel and programs that receive money from the prevention fund are the front-line workers inwho must respond to a new scary germ and health departments across the country that help them detect respond to and control Schuchat saidOne of the of the prevention fund is the CDCs immunization program which last_year received $324 million The money is sent directly to states and local communities to improve immunization infrastructure such as registries that allow providers to know which patients have received what vaccines Money from the prevention fund accounted for about 40 percent of the CDCs total immunization program funding last yearLosing this funding would cripple CDCs ability to detect prevent and respond to respiratory and related infectious diseases threats including pandemic influenza according an on the impact of the prevention fundThe prevention fund also supports a CDC-led surveillance program to monitor children at highest risk for exposure For situations such as the recent lead-in-water crisis in Flint Mich its the tool that allows you to identify when theres a cluster of lead cases Auerbach saidsEarly on Monday morning that Paul_Manafort and his former business_partner Rick_Gates were turning themselves in to federal authorities to face charges related to special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_IIIs investigation_into Russian_meddling in the 2016 electionBelow an overview of why Manafort in particular may have been ensnared by Muellers investigationPaul Manafort is a longtime political consultant and lobbyist in Washington His career took two tracks that are important for understanding how we got to this pointThe first is that Manafort helped multiple Republican presidential nominees manage their efforts at their party conventions including Gerald Ford in 1976 Ronald_Reagan in 1980 and 1984 and George H W_Bush in 1988 He also managed Bob Doles 1996 presidential bidThe second is that Manafort also worked on behalf of a number of questionable international actors including Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos and the Russia-backed president of Ukraine Viktor_Yanukovych Yanukovych was ousted in 2014 during the period in which Russia-Ukraine tensions spiked Much more on this below In March_2016 as Donald Trump was trying to ensure his victory in the Republican nomination fight he hired Manafort to help corral delegates for the upcoming convention At the time you may remember there was a lot of talk about whether or not Republican delegates pledged to Trump would hold steady as the convention unfolded Manafort had with that task in 1976 fending off a challenge from Reagan The recommendation to hire Manafort came from Trumps longtime ally Roger Stone whod formed a lobbying firm with Manafort after the 1980 electionManafort accepted a position with the Trump campaign for no salary Manaforts questionable business associations were well known but at the time Trump was still having trouble attracting top-tier Republican staffers who were skeptical that Trump was a viable candidateOnce on the campaign he butted heads with campaign_manager Corey_Lewandowski In late June Trumps children convince him to oust Lewandowski and elevate Manafort who became campaign_chairman He held that senior position with the campaign until August On the day he resigned former House speaker Newt Gingrich Fox_News Sean Hannity that nobody should underestimate how_much Paul_Manafort did to really help get this campaign to where it is right nowIn addition to hand-picking Manafort led the effort to put down the rebellion at the convention By far most impt person in campaign John Weaver (@JWGOP) For this we need to talk a bit more about Manaforts backgroundIn 2006 Manaforts company (of which Gates was part) signed a multi-year agreement with a Russian oligarch named Oleg Deripaska apparently based on a in which Manafort outlined a strategy that would greatly benefit the [Russian president Vladimir] Putin Government Deripaska is closely tied to PutinThat same year Manafort began working with Yanukovychs Party of Regions in Ukraine In 2010 Yanukovych was elected as that countrys president In 2014 he was ousted during a popular uprising in the country largely because of his sympathies for RussiaA ledger found in a former Party of Regions office in Kiev reported last_year that Manafort may have received nearly $13 million in off-the-record payments from the party during his time working with them Manafort denied the allegation but the Associated Press later some of the paymentsAt the time Trump was facing about his relationship with Russia and any financial ties to the country Revelation that his campaign_chairman may have been paid by a Russian-backed political party helped spur Trump to oust Manafort from his positionNoIts important to remember that the investigation by Mueller is looking at Russian_meddling in the 2016 election as well as any possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian agents But as an arm of the Justice_Department Muellers_team is also to investigate any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigationThink about it this way If the police were called to your house to interview you about noise complaint and saw you standing over a dead body holding a knife that might also come up as a subject of conversationThe indictment includes 12 counts focused on a few things Misleading the government failing to register as a foreign agent laundering money and failing to report foreign incomeIt includes a conspiracy charge which is broadly about misleading the government including that Manafort (and Gates) provided false_statements to investigators and failed to register as foreign agents (Manafort eventually did so after his work with the campaign drew attention to himself) This is a charge the Manafort conspired against the United_States on behalf of Russia during the electionThe financial charges relate to $75 million that Manafort and Gates earned overseas $18 million of which was then allegedly laundered by Manafort This money was apparently largely earned through the pairs work in UkraineIts important to note that these investigations predate Manaforts time as head of the Trump campaign In 2014 the FBI began an investigation_into Manafort including (That same year Deripaska accused Manafort and Gates of from him that was meant to be invested in a cable network in Ukraine) The investigation_into Manafort was restarted in the of last_year BuzzFeed that the FBI is investigating wire transfers that were made in 2012 and 2013 In other words even had he not worked with Trumps campaign Manafort might have faced an indictment like this anywayThe main caveat worth remembering here is that Manafort was out of the campaign by August meaning that he wasnt there for the closing days of Trumps effort That said there are two ways in which Manafort and Russian interests overlapped during his time on the campaignThe first relates to Deripaska the Putin-allied oligarch Shortly after Manafort started with the campaign he emailed a business_partner in Ukraine and asked how his new position to get whole asking if Deripaskas team was aware of his new position Later in the campaign Manafort sought to pass word to Deripaska that a on the campaign might be possible It doesnt seem to have happened(Worth noting During the campaign the Trump campaign then managed by Manafort worked to in the party platform about arming Ukraine in its efforts against Russia)Manafort was also one of the participants in the infamous Trump_Tower meeting set_up by Donald Trump Jr and involving a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer who was offering dirt on Hillary_Clinton During that meeting Trump Jr described Manafort as being on his phone the whole time hinting that the content was not interesting to the campaign_chairman Later though Manafort turned over from the meeting that hed taken on his phoneIt is possible that the Manafort indictment is meant to serve as leverage in Muellers broader investigation There is no mention in the indictment of Trump In 2006 Manafort bought a condominium in Trump_Tower Other New_York real_estate Manafort in 2012 is listed in the indictment because the money used to buy the properties wasnt included in his tax returnsMore charges could be filed against Manafort in the futureTrump has a pattern of continuing to talk with people hed once hired on the campaign even if theyd been fired Its not clear if that was maintained with Manafort though Manafort did former White_House chief of staff Reince Priebus shortly before Trumps inauguration The Daily Beast in June that Gates was a regular visitor to the White_House working with Trump ally Tom Barrack (Barrack recently over Trumps presidency in an interview with The Post)Below our interactive timeline of how and when Russia and the Trump campaign may have intersectedA few years before he became Donald Trumps campaign_chairman longtime Republican political operative Paul_Manafort went on a spending spree with money funneled through a network of offshore bank_accounts a federal indictment unsealed_Monday alleges He bought a $15 million brownstone in a trendy New_York neighborhood and a $19million home in Arlington Va He paid for three Range Rovers and a Mercedes-Benz landscaping at his Hamptons getaway and pricey improvements at his house in Palm_Beach Fla In all out of more_than $75million that flowed through the offshore_accounts more_than $18 million was laundered with income concealed from the US government and was used in part to cover Manaforts lavish lifestyle the indictment says The indictment of the refined and impeccably dressed former campaign_chairman detailed an alleged scheme in which foreign clients paid millions in exchange for Manaforts consulting services Manaforts lawyer Kevin Downing rebutted the charges Monday saying Manafort was not seeking to launder funds Manafort a confidant of presidents dating back to George HW Bush and Ronald_Reagan was the biggest name charged thus far in a federal investigation by special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III who is examining possible collusion by Trumps campaign with Russia Manaforts indictment along with charges_against his former business_partner Rick_Gates who also worked for the Trump campaign brought Mueller close to the inner circle that guided Trumps 2016 victory Manafort and Gates pleaded not guilty and did_not speak to reporters This indictment is tragic for Paul and his family said Manaforts former business_partner Charles Black who said he couldnt speak to the specifics because he hasnt worked with Manafort for two_decades For him and Rick_Gates I just pray that they are innocent Manafort was brought into Trumps presidential campaign in spring 2016 tasked with tracking delegates before becoming chairman The arrival of a seasoned operative had been welcomed at the time by many Republican leaders as a sign that Trump was ready to professionalize a largely undisciplined campaign as he was preparing to secure the GOP nomination But the court_papers unsealed_Monday show how Trump in tapping Manafort also brought aboard a senior strategist with deep ongoing and potentially problematic foreign entanglements For decades Manafort has been known for his dealings with foreign leaders including some with less-than-savory reputations In recent years in addition to his work for Trump and for a Ukrainian presidential_candidate he has made deals with foreign business titans that have resulted in controversy including one with a Russian oligarch who charged that Manafort and Gates disappeared without paying money they allegedly owed him Manafort and Gates denied the allegation Manaforts journey from being one of Washingtons most sought-after political operatives to defendant in a high-profile federal investigation is a story of a chase for power and money Manafort 68 was raised in Connecticut the son of the mayor of New Britain With a Georgetown University law degree he worked for President Gerald Fords 1976 campaign tracking delegates at the nominating convention He ran Ronald Reagans 1980 presidential campaign in the South Manaforts ascendancy in Washington reached new heights when he became a founding partner in 1980 of the lobbying firm Black Manafort & Stone with Black and Roger Stone the latter a longtime Trump confidant During Manaforts 16 years at the firm his clients included two dictators Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire (now Congo) and Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines who allegedly stole billions of dollars from their countriesIn 1989 Manafort testified before Congress about a deal in which he lobbied to obtain $43million in federal housing subsidies for a New_Jersey project while his firm held an option to buy a stake in the property The firm invested before the subsidies were awarded but Manafort testified that he had a high degree of expectation that they would win approval The technical term for what we do and what law firms associations and professional groups do is lobbying Manafort said For purposes of today I will admit that in a narrow sense some people might term it influence peddlingManaforts globe-trotting lifestyle led friends to dub him the Count of Monte Cristo a reference to the swashbuckling hero of a 19th-century French novel Manafort later became a partner in the firm of Davis Manafort which Manafort owned with Richard Davis As a partner Manafort wooed a Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska Manafort and Davis had proposed setting up a $200million private equity fund to invest mostly in Russia and Ukraine according to a petition filed by Deripaska one of a number of fund contributors Derispaka invested in the partnership through a company called Surf Horizon incorporated in Cyprus in 2007 Deripaska sought repayment of some of his investment after the 2007 financial crisis saying in a petition that he was owed $19million from a failed investment in Ukraine Deripaska said in a 2014 petition that he was still waiting to be paid but it appears that Paul_Manafort and Rick_Gates have simply disappeared Deripaskas representative said in 2016 they were still seeking the money but a Manafort spokesman subsequently told the New_York Times that no funds were owed During his time at the Trump campaign Manafort sought to communicate with Deripaska through an intermediary suggesting that his new position provided an opportunity to settle financial disputes according to Manaforts email correspondence which was turned over to investigators this year A turning point for Manafort came in the early 2000s when he became a consultant for Viktor_Yanukovych who would later become Ukraines president One of Yanukovychs supporters was a Ukrainian energy tycoon and Manafort soon tried to do business with him according to a filing in a now-dismissed lawsuit In 2008 Manafort met with Firtash to discuss a proposal to build an $850 million 65-story apartment building in New_York City A lawsuit filed by former Ukrainian prime_minister Yulia Tymoshenko alleged that Firtash worked with Manafort to invest illicit profits from energy deals in Ukraine Firtash and Manafort denied the allegations and the suit was ultimately dismissed Spokesmen for Deripaska and Firtash did_not respond to requests forcommentGates 45 met Manafort when he interned at his firm Black Manafort & Stone Manafort accompanied by Gates worked for Yanukovych and his Party of Regions as Yanukovych won the presidency of Ukraine in 2010 While Manafort said he was working for a pro-Western politician who embraced democracy Yanukovych was ultimately seen as aligned with Russian President_Vladimir Putin Between 2012 and 2014 Manaforts firm was paid $17 million by the Party of Regions according to Manaforts belated filing under the Foreign_Agents Registration_Act As part of Mondays indictment Manafort and Gates were accused of hiding their lobbying work for Ukraine in violation of the registration requirements The following year in 2015 Manafort owned an apartment at Trump_Tower in New_York City and had invested in other properties By early 2016 Manafort wanted to join Trumps presidential campaign He hadnt been in close touch with Trump for years so he sought out one of Trumps oldest and closest friends Thomas J Barrack Jr to serve as a conduit Barrack and Manafort were also longtime friends Barrack a billionaire who runs a real_estate investment company said in a recent interview that the only financial deal he had ever made with Manafort was around 2004 when he lent $15 million for a house owned by Manaforts wife Barrack said the loan was paid back at market rate in 14 months Shortly after Trump lost the Iowa caucuses Manafort met Barrack at the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills Paul came to me and said I really need to get to [Trump] I_think I can be really effective at the convention Barrack said Barrack said in the interview that he sent materials about Manafort to Trumps son-in-law Jared_Kushner and Kushners wife Ivanka Trump Barrack had known both of them for years In the email Barrack wrote that Manafort would be a killer at the job Trump agreed to hire Manafort who said he would work without pay Manafort subsequently became campaign_chairman During his time in the position Manafort attended a June 9 2016 meeting with Kushner and Donald Trump Jr at which a Russian lawyer was said to have damaging_information about Hillary_Clinton The meeting is not mentioned in the indictment but it has been a focus of Muellers_investigation into whether Russia colluded with the Trump campaign Manafort resigned in August 2016 after reports of his ties to Yanukovych and the publication of a ledger in Ukraine that showed millions of dollars of supposedly off the books payments to Manafort from the Party of Regions a claim Manafort has denied Barrack invited Manafort to join him on his yacht off the coast of Greece He got fired and I felt terrible Barrack said When Manafort called he was depressed I said I have got five guys on a boat and Join us He came over and he spent four or five days figuring out what he would do nextBarrack subsequently hired Gates for two positions first to be deputy chairman of the Presidential Inaugural Committee of which Barrack was chairman and second as a Washington-based consultant of his company Colony NorthStar Gates remained in the latter position until the time of the indictment when his contract with the company was terminated according to an official familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasnt authorized to speak publicly During their work in Ukraine starting in 2008 Manafort and Gates allegedly devised a scheme to defraud banks and other institutions by wiring money to accounts in a way that laundered the funds without paying taxes Details of Manaforts luxurious lifestyle and income were spread on social_media in February when hackers exposed a cache of more_than 285000 personal messages purportedly stolen from the iPhone of Manaforts daughter Andrea Manaforts spokesman previously confirmed that the phone was hacked and that some of the texts placed on line were authentic but he has declined to authenticate the entire cache In one of the posted text messages Andrea Manafort wrote to her sister in 2015 Dont fool yourself The money we have is blood money Rosalind Helderman and Alice_Crites contributed to this reportThe United Stateswill

mansion before he was arrested according to a court documentThe suspect identified as Jonathan Tuan-Anh Tran 26 made it all the way to the exterior of the White_House which he walked alongside and then hid behind a pillar before he was spotted and apprehended near the South Portico entranceThe court document released Saturday evening omits any reference to alarms sounding and suggests that the first realization of an intruder was when a uniformed agent saw the suspect up to 200 yards from where he entered The US Secret_Service declined to answer_questions about how the man penetrated so deep onto the White_House grounds citing an ongoing investigationIn a brief statement earlier Saturday the agency said the suspect had breached the outer perimeterA DC Superior Court judge ordered Tran detained through the weekend He was charged with entering restricted grounds while carrying a dangerous weapon Tran is expected to appear in federal court Monday He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted The charges were upgraded from his initial arrest for unlawful entryTrans court-appointed attorney Gregg D Baron asked that his client be released But Judge Jennifer DiToro ruled him a flight and safety risk Tran appeared wearing a blue zip-up sweatshirt khaki jeans a white T-shirt and glasses He made no public statementA federal law_enforcement official said Tran has no prior criminal record and had no previous history with the Secret_Service The official spoke on the condition of not being named to discuss information about the suspect that is not usually made public by police Tran is from Milpitas just outside San JoseTran told a Secret_Service officer that he has been called schizophrenic according to the criminal complaint He had the Mace in a jacket pocket and a book bag with a book on Trump a US passport and an Apple laptop the complaint saysOn the computer the Secret_Service said it found a letter addressed to Trump discussing Russian hackers and that he had information of relevance Tran alleged in the letter that he had been followed and that his phone and email were being read by othersPresident Trump who was in the residence at the time of the breach said the Secret_Service service did a fantastic job last night and he described the suspect as a troubled personSurveillance video showed Tran jumping a fence near the Treasury Building on East Executive Avenue He was arrested about 1138 pm According to the criminal complaint Tran told the arresting officer I am a friend of the president I have an appointmentFriday nights fence jumper is believed to be the first since Trump took_office In the previous two years many people tried or succeeded in getting into one of the most secure residences in the world Last year the Secret_Service added small spikes or pencil points to the top of the six-foot fence that surrounds the White_House complex The agency also announced a plan to raise the height of the fence to 11 feet by 2018Perhaps the most serious breach was on Sept 19 2014 when Omar Gonzalez climbed over the north fence and made his way deep into the White_House When he was finally tackled by an off-duty Secret_Service agent in the ornate East Room he was found to have a knife in a pants pocket Two hatchets a machete and 800 rounds of ammunition were found in his car nearby Secret_Service Director Julia Pierson resigned two weeks laterAfter that incident the Department of Homeland_Security flagged as a serious concern that not all officers on the complex were aware or heard the alarm that should have alerted them to a jumper crossing the fence line In that case a fence alarm did sound but several radio and communication failures prevented some officers from hearing itRecently departed Secret_Service director Joseph Clancy had pledged to fix the vulnerabilities that allowed the 2014 jumper to get so close to the presidential familys residence John Wagner contributed to this reportIts official Truth is deadFacts arepasseAnd this sentiment Oxford Dictionaries has selected post-truth as 2016s international word of the year after the contentious and an caused usage of the adjective to skyrocket according to the Oxford University PressThe dictionary defines post-truth as relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal beliefIn this case the post- prefix doesnt mean after so much as it implies an atmosphere in which a notionis irrelevant but then again who says you have to take our word for it anymoreThroughout a grueling presidential campaign in which accusations of lies and alternate realities flowed freely in every direction hundreds of fact_checks were published about statements from both Donald Trump and Hillary ClintonDozens of media outlets found that Trumps relationship with the truth was well complicatedWe concede all politicians lie Nevertheless Donald Trump is in a class by himself She cited who described Trumps dishonesty in May as qualitatively different than anything before seen from a major-party nomineeNone of this seemed to matter significantly to those who supported himThere is no doubt that even in the quadrennial truth-stretching that happens in presidential campaigns Trump has set records for fabrication days before the electionAnd yet Cillizza noted Trump was seen as more honest than Clinton by an eight-point margin according to released on Nov 2Post-truth was selected after Oxfords dictionary editors noted a roughly 2000 percent increase in its usage over 2015 it was appearing with far more frequency in news articles and on social_media in both the United Kingdom and the United StatesThe first spike came in June driven by therhetoric leading up to Oxford Dictionaries President Casper Grathwohl said in a statementPost-truth usage spiked again in July after Trump secured theRepublican presidential nominationIts not surprising that our choice reflects a year dominated by highly-charged political and social discourse Grathwohl said Fueled by the rise of social_media as a news source and a growing distrust of facts offered up by the establishment post-truth as a concept has been finding its linguistic footing for some time Post-truth was selected as the 2016 word of the year even before results of the election were knownsaid Katherine Martin the head of US dictionaries for Oxford University PressWe choose words that are going to highlight the interplay between our words and our culture Martin said The final word of the year is meant to be one that captures the ethos mood or preoccupations of that particular year and to have lasting potential as a word of cultural significanceThe Washington Posts own Fact_Checker blog which published 314 fact_checks of the candidates who ran for president during the 2016 election cycle has noted that in many ways it was an unbalanced race but didnt go so_far as to endorse the term post-truthI have never been a fan of the word post-truth since its a facile way to describe basic human behavior since the first words were spoken The Fact Checkers Glenn Kessler said in an email People have always been swayed by emotions and personal beliefs As fact checkers we give people the factual information and context for statements made by politicians What people do with those facts is up to them The Fact Checkers Michelle Ye Hee Lee noted that of the blogs 314 fact_checks for this election 168 were about claims made by Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary_Clinton And ofTrumps average Pinocchio rating was 34breaking Rep Michele Bachmanns previous worst Pinocchio average of 308 in 2012Clinton on the other hand ended up with an average Pinocchio rating of 22 putting her in the same range as President_Obama and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney she saidAnd what did people do with these facts They elected Trump the 45th president of the United StatesFor what its worth post-truth is not to be confused with truthiness a subtly different term that described the phenomenon of Now Im sure some of the word police the wordinistas over at Websters are gonna to say hey thats not a word said Colbert in the 2005 segment that introduced the word Well anybody who knows me know that Im no fan of dictionaries or reference books Theyre elitist Constantly telling us what is or isnt true or what did or didnt happenAt the time Colbert was still playing an exaggerated caricature of a conservative political-show hostWhos Britannica to tell me the Panama Canal was finished in 1914 he continued in the segment If I want to say it happened in 1941 thats my I dont trust books Theyre all fact no heartMerriam-Webster made truthiness its 2006 word of the yearAnd if anything the rise of truthiness cleared the path for post-truth as in In a post-truth world truthiness is all that mattersGiven that usage of the term hasnt shown any signs of slowing down I wouldnt be surprised if post-truth becomes one of the defining words of our time said Grathwohl the Oxford Dictionaries presidentEach year the Oxford staff selects hundreds of words then narrows that list down through discussions about what words are going to best highlight the ways in which the English lexicon is changing in response to current events said Martin Oxfords head of US dictionariesThis year the shortlist included adulting (often packaged into the phrase adulting so hard as in Im adulting so hard that I bought a leaf blower and increased my contribution to my 401(k) retirement savings plan) and which refers to a comfortable conviviality and feeling of contentment central to Danish culturePost-truth also beat out finalist alt-right a shortening of alternative right defined by Oxford as an ideological grouping associated with extreme conservative or reactionary viewpoints characterized by a rejection of mainstream politics and by the use of online media to disseminate deliberately controversial contentUse of alt-right in 2016 has increased dramatically as well in large part because of Trumps ties to prominent alt-right figures such as This years discussion was a bit more serious and somber than it has been in some other years Martin saidFor those who have forgotten the Oxford Dictionaries specifically this one The Oxford Dictionaries usually announces the word of the year in mid-November But Martin noted there was still time for the mood to shift during the end of the yearWho knows what will happen in the last [weeks] of 2016 she said Hopefully something really wonderful that gives us another ideaLast week Tony Podesta an eminence in the annals of Washington lobbying threw one of his signature events a big birthday bash at his stately stone manse in Kalorama His guests thought he was on top of his world one of the men who makes the city goOn Monday hours after the first indictments in the investigation_into ties between President Trumps campaign and the Russian_government Podesta abruptly quit his post atop the Podesta_Group the capitals eighth-wealthiest lobbying firm Podestas departure came as and his business_partner Rick_Gates raised questions about the work Podestas firm did with Manafort to buff the image of the Ukrainian government Podesta 74 said he was quitting because of the barrage of criticism hes been getting as special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III pursues the investigationIt is impossible to run a public affairs firm while you are under attack by Fox_News and the right wing media Podesta told employees at the Podesta_Group offices on Monday according to a person_familiar with his remarksFor decades Tony and John_Podesta brothers who share a Jesuit education a devotion to liberal causes and a passion for politics have been central players in Washington And in the past_year both have been drawn into the orbit of scandals Tonys Podesta_Group is one of two firms described in Mondays indictment as having been recruited by Manafort and Gates to lobby on behalf of Viktor_Yanukovych the former president of Ukraine who according to people_familiar with the companys involvement Federal prosecutorsManafort of creating a scheme to mislead the government about his secret work for a Ukrainian political leaderBoth the Podesta_Group and the other firm Mercury Public Affairs have said they were hired to lobby for a European nonprofit based in Brussels trying to polish Ukraines image in the West But behind the scenes prosecutors allege the real client was a political party led by the former Ukraine president who was friendly with RussiaJohn Podesta a longtime Democratic adviser who led the presidential campaign of Hillary_Clinton has spent the past_year coping with the publication by Wikileaks of tens of thousands of his emails which were hacked by someone using a computer with an address in Ukraine The release of those emails ensnared him in the ornate conspiracy theory in which some anti-Clinton activists came to believe without evidence that sexually abused children were being hidden below a pizza place in Northwest Washington and that John_Podesta was involved with satanic rituals there a notion that police said was bogusIn an emailed statement Monday John_Podesta said I view being attacked by Donald Trump and right wing media as a badge of honor To their opponents the Podestas are quintessential swamp rats exemplars of the permanent Washington establishment Their defenders however view them as the oil that makes the gears of government turnAdvocacy is an important part of our process and its an honorable profession said former senator Tom Daschle (D-SD) now a lobbyist Both Podestas have been enormously successful but were in as toxic an environment as anyone living today has ever seen The quality of governance has suffered immensely as a result The brothers although close are quite differentTony is more gregarious and outgoing and John is more introspective and quiet but they are brothers and they are still close said Ron Klain who was chief of staff to vice presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore John is the eminence grise of the Democratic_Party and all the efforts by Republicans and completely crazy people to discredit him have not changed thatTony Podesta has been a pivotal figure in the murky connections between policy and politics becoming wealthy on fees from industries and foreign entities that want something from Congress and the White_House He also bundles big donations and dispenses them to politicians who might someday be helpful to those lobbying clientsHe and his former wife Heather Podesta held lavish fundraisers for Democratic candidates at their home which boasted a world-class art collection and a wine cellar with thousands of bottles The Podesta brothers mother made the pesto Tony dressed the part of a man in full he sported eye-catching neckties and red Prada loafers The pope wears Prada he once told a reporter and so do I(Heather and Tony several years_ago according to court records and news reports they spent 109 hours with a mediator before coming to a settlement on how to divide their art and other properties)Although the brothers created their lobbying firm together in 1988 John_Podesta has spent most of his career inside government He had several jobs in Congress and was President Bill Clintons chief of staff and counselor to President_Barack Obama Theyre brothers but they chose different roads to go down to craft good public policy said Rep Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn) who knows both Podestas Tony Podesta worked on a string of losing Democratic presidential campaigns from Eugene McCarthys 1968 bid on through Hubert Humphrey Ed Muskie George McGovern Ted Kennedy Walter Mondale and finally Michael Dukakis in 1988Thats when the brothers created Podesta Associates which became the Podesta_Group representing some of the countrys biggest and most_powerful businesses including Walmart Bank of America and BP (The Washington_Post employed the firm in the early 2000s when it was part of a public company controlled by the Graham family then-owners of The Post)The Podesta_Group collected $252 million in fees over the past two_decades according toThis year the firms top clients are Mylan a pharmaceutical company Wells Fargo Crawford Group the parent of Enterprise car rentals and Lockheed Martin the defense contractor according to federal recordsAlong the way the firm also represented a number of foreign entities including the government of Egypt under ex-dictator Hosni MubarakMore and more foreign countries turn to lobbyists to do work that diplomats once did themselves said James Thurber a government professor at American University who studies lobbying Things have gotten so much more complex in the last thirty years in the business that foreign companies and foreign countries do in WashingtonMondays indictments described a multitiered arrangement in which Manafort and Gates are alleged to have pulled the strings as the other firms cited only as Company_A and Company_B were the publicly acknowledged lobbyists for the Brussels group Sources familiar with the two companies work said the descriptions in the indictment indicate that Company_A was Mercury and Company_B was the Podesta GroupThe Podesta_Group has fully cooperated with the Special Counsels office and taken every possible step to provide documentation that confirms compliance with the law said Molly Levinson a spokeswoman for the firm She said the work the firm did was in support of Ukraines admission to the [European Union] and the Brussels group certified that it was neither funded by nor directed by a government or political partyMichael McKeon a partner at Mercury said his firm disclosed that it worked for the Brussels group with the intention of aligning Ukraine with western democracies generally and the European_Union specificallyIn 2012 when Manafort and Gates first sought out the two firms to lobby for their business associate in Ukraine Gates wrote to Mercury that the firm would be representing the Government of Ukraine in DCDays after Donald Trump won the 2016_presidential election he summoned Preet Bharara to Trump_Tower The president-elect wanted to talk to the US attorney for the Southern_District of New_York about his futureAfterward Bharara one of the most influential prosecutors in the country best known for going after Wall_Street as well as members of both political parties told_reporters hed been asked whether he wanted to stay onThe President-elect asked presumably because hes a New_Yorker and is aware of the great work that our office has done over the past seven years asked to meet with me to discuss whether or not Id be prepared to stay on as the United_States attorney to do the work as we have done it independently without fear or favor for the last seven years Bharara said in a brief statement to reporters after meeting with Trump Three months later Bharara is suddenly out of a job part of an ouster of 46 US attorneys appointed by President_Barack ObamaBhararato tender his resignationIt was an abrupt end to Bhararas nearly-eight-year tenure prosecuting powerful people in finance and politicsI did_not resign Moments ago I was fired Being the US Attorney in SDNY will forever be the greatest honor of my professional life Preet Bharara (@PreetBharara) In 2015 described Bharara as the most_powerful prosecutor in the country for whom no target is apparently too big Bharara also had developed a reputation for wit and outspokenness FBI_director James_B Comey said the impression he gave was if Jon Stewart was a prosecutorBhararas style drew appreciation from some legal scholars but also reprimands from others for showboating as Jenkins reportedOnce Bharara opened a speaking engagement before a roomful of financial traders by saying I just want to apologize in advance that I dont have enough subpoenas for all of you As the audience broke out in laughter he said Im just kidding Pause I do have enoughDuring his tenure Bharara has indicted 17 prominent New_York politicians for malfeasance 10 of them Democrats Jenkins reported He also investigated New_York Gov Andrew M Cuomo after he closed an ethics commissionIn 2012 he was named one of Time Magazines most influential people The write-up a conservative legal scholar and an old buddy of BhararasWithout drama his Manhattan team has battled terrorism convicting the Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad crippled international criminal networks run by Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout Jamaican drug trafficker Christopher Coke and Colombian rebel group FARC and in March secured a half-billion-dollar forfeiture from computer contractor SAIC in the biggest fraud ever against New_York City Those are good cases well prosecutedBharara was an outspoken man in a job that has been held by vocal and politically aspirant predecessors including former New_York Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani and ComeyAlong with his bipartisan prosecutions Bharara developed a reputation for being tough on insider trading although he was criticized for the lack of prosecutions that followed the financial crisis Bharara defended himself saying it was far harder to jail independent business executives because they had consulted attorneys every step of the wayIt is a very difficult thing to put a person in jail when they say I asked my lawyers to do the best they could and tell me what Im supposed to do and they are independent and they were paid a fee Bharara said in 2014 So those are among the various obstacles you have By then were pondering Bhararas ambitions for higher office Bharara insisted he had none and in many other interviews had given every indication that he intended to stay in prosecution for the long haul In the early days of the presidential primary race he would do his job forever if I couldI mean look I care about public service I care about honest government Bharara Im a prosecutor Im a lawyer This is what I plan to do for a long timeHe also half-jokingly told Melber that it took some time for his parents who immigrated to the United_States from India with nothing to appreciate his new jobAs I joked theyve finally gotten over the fact that their Indian American son didnt become a doctor Bharara told Melber But it took you know doing all of this before they finally realized Okay I guess its not a bad gigAlthough Bhararas future political aspirations remain unclear one thing is certain the former US attorney wont be able to become presidentBharara was born in Firozpur in Punjab India and migrated with his family to the United_States as a toddler His father moved the family to Buffalo after he was granted a fellowship to practice medicine They eventually settled in New_Jersey and Bharara went on to attend Harvard then Columbia Law SchoolHis Indian heritage made him a unique target for critics who called him out for arresting and charging Indian nationalsAs Jenkins notedBhararas heritage did_not prevent him from arresting and charging Indias deputy consul general Indian diplomats reacted with outrage calling him a self-loathing traitor to his heritage and an embarrassed State_Department had to bail out Khobragade with diplomatic immunityEveryone should understand that our motivation is always to do the right thing and we dont pull our punches and we dont care who you are Bharara says unapologeticallyBharara that a lot of people in the country of my birth for whatever reason began to think that it was something having to do with me personally even though had they inquired a little_bit would have discovered that this office brings cases based on the facts and the law And it doesnt matter you know who you are and what you look like and where youre fromHis own parents he once told Melber wouldnt talk explicitly about public service when we were growing up But it was very clear that they thought it was important to give back And maybe its you know common for immigrant families who got so much from America that they think thatPresident Trumpis expected to nominate Jerome H Powell as the next chair of the Federal Reserve according to two people_familiar with the presidents decision who spoke on the condition of anonymityThe White_House intends to announce the Fed chair selection on ThursdayIf confirmed by the SenatePowell would begin serving as chair in February replacing Janet L Yellen a Democrat whom Trumphas at times praisedbut many Republicans wanted replacedPowell a Republicanis widely viewed as a safe pick who is unlikely to make any dramatic changes to the Feds handling of the economy at a time when the stock market is soaring and unemployment is at a 16-year lowUnlike some of the other candidates Trump considered Powell has been supportive of Yellens policy of slowly raising interest rates which have been at historic lows for nearly a decade as the Fed looked to help the economy recover from a massive recession Trump has expressed interest in keeping rates low as he aims to stimulate the economy and get more Americans higher-paying jobsTrump said Friday he has someone very specific in mind for the FedIt will be a person who hopefully will do a fantastic job Trump said in a short video message posted on Instagram and TwitterThe Fed operates independently from the White_House Much as with Supreme_Court nominees once Powell is confirmed Trump will not have any sway over him making the choice a critical one because the Fed has the power to help stimulate the economy or slow it downif the central bank governors believe the economy is heating up too quicklyThe chairman of the Federal Reserve has control of the most_powerful lever to influence world prosperity says Gary Richardson professor of economics at the University of California at Irvine and the former officialFed historian Ifthe chair makes good decisions about interest rates billions of people around the world will be better off If the chair makes mistakes he or she can put hundreds of millions of people out of work around the globePowell is no stranger to the Fed and the important role it serves at the heart of theglobal economy Hes served_as a Fed governor a top leadership role within the central bank since 2012 He also has deep experience on Wall_Street and in Washington Early in his career he served_as undersecretary of the US Treasury Department for former president George HW Bush Then he became a partner at private equity firm The Carlyle Group amassing a sizable fortune of between $20 million and $55 million that allowed him to then take a job working for $1 as an expert_at the Bipartisan Policy Center after he left the investment firmAlthough Powell has long been a Republican former colleagues at the Fed and Bipartisan Policy Center describe him as right-leaning but not an ideologuePresident Barack_Obama originally nominated Powell to the Fed board Powell studied law at Georgetown University not economics but many say he has become well versed inmacroeconomics in his time at the FedWhen he showed up at the Fed he basically did_not know much about macroeconomics or monetary policy says Seth Carpenter chief US economist at UBS who spent 15 years at the Fed including time overlapping with Powell He made a conscious decision to spend a lot of time with staff and colleagues to learn as deeply and completely as possiblePowell has developed a reputation in Washington as a consensus builder who studies issues extensively before making decisions He never dissented on any of the Feds decisions in his time on the board opting instead to try to work behind the scenes when he felt it was important to sway the course of actionPeople familiar with Trumps thinking on selecting Powell who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the president felt Powell would bring stability and continuity to the Fed because so many know him there already but Powell was also likely to help pull back some regulations on financial institutionsTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin pushed hard for Trump to select Powellafter working with him recently toreview ways to roll back regulations on financial firms a goal of the Trump administration In public speeches Powell has indicated he thinks that regulations put in place after the financial crisis went too farMost on Wall_Street welcomed the news that Powell is the likely nominee Investment bank Deutsche Bank put out a note last_week to clients saying Powell would be the best choice if Trump did_not want to keep Yellen onBut some liberal groups including Fed Up were disappointed arguing the selection of Powell is an attempt to make the Fed morefavorable to big banksJerome Powells most important qualification is that he served with Janet Yellen His confirmation should depend on his willingness to follow in Yellens footsteps on both monetary and regulatory policy said Shawn Sebastian co-director of Fed Up a campaign from the Center for Popular DemocracyWhen Kim Young-sam became South_Koreas first democratically elected civilian president in 1993 he vowed to cure the country of the Korean disease the political corruption that had become endemicKim oversaw an ambitious drive to clean up the country even authorizing the arrest of his two immediate predecessors on corruption-related charges although he eventually became infected by the disease himself when his son was arrested on corruption and bribery chargesCorruption bribery embezzlement and the abuse of power have been modulated over the past generation but remain indisputable components of official South_Korea as the scandal now engulfing President Park_Geun-hye showsPark is set to be questioned by prosecutors as soon as Thursday about her role in an influence-peddling scandal revolving around a friend of 40 yearsAlthough every South_Korean president since democratization in 1987 has become ensnared by corruption in one way or another Park will become the first incumbent to be grilled by prosecutors She cannot be charged while in office but could be indicted after she leaves which may happen sooner than expectedMost analysts had thought Park would try to ride out the storm until the next election in December 2017But after a third week of huge protests hundreds of thousands gathered in central Seoul on Saturday drawing comparisons to the demonstrations that ended military rule almost 30_years ago the chances of her being forced out of office have increased Eurasia Group a consulting firm that assesses risk now puts the probability at 70percent The situation has reached a point of no return Moon Jae-in an opposition politician and presidential hopeful said Tuesday Up to then he had demanded that she hand over day-to-day running of the country to the prime_minister chosen by parliament But now he said that was no_longer sufficient I along with the citizens will carry out a nationwide campaign for Parks resignation until she declares she will unconditionally step aside he saidThe scandal flared last_month when it emerged that Park widely considered a distant figure was being secretly advised by a friend of 40 years a woman with no policy background but with ties to a religious cultThe woman Choi_Soon-sil is accused of receiving classified information and of using her ties to Park to raise up to $70million from big business groups for two foundations most of which she is said to have siphoned off and to get her daughter into a prestigious university She is in custody and is expected to be indicted this weekParks attempts at quelling the public fury over this shadow president have amounted to nothing as shown by the increasingly large protests against herThe scandal has highlighted just how prevalent the Korean disease remainsIt encompasses the presidential Blue_House with some of Parks aides suspected of helping Choi raise money and big business with Samsung alone said to have given $20million directly to Choi or to her foundations Senior officials from big conglomerates including Samsung Hyundai Motors and LG have been called in for questioning This adds to the woes at Samsung already reeling from the withdrawal of one its flagship products the Galaxy Note 7 phoneIt also involves the powerful prosecutors office which is accused of being too political A prominent former prosecutor who served_as a senior presidential secretary to Park is now under investigation on suspicion of helping Choi and tipping off big businesses to pending raids And hard-charging prosecutors often end up working in the Blue_House or at the big conglomerates further cementing personal links_between institutions Stephan Haggard professor of Korea-Pacific studies at the University of California at San Diego said the scandal is bigger than WatergateIts the scope of the violations that are in play he said Theres the classified information the foundations the university There are half a dozen discrete things that are likely to be illegalRa Jong-yil a former deputy director of South_Korean intelligence also sees echoes of the Watergate scandal The easiest way to fix this is for the president to resign just like Nixon did Ra saidThe kind of corruption seen in South_Korea is partly the result of government-sponsored industrialization It was Parks father authoritarian president Park Chung-hee who supported the creation of corporate giants such as Samsung and Hyundai encouraging links_between government and business in the 1960s and 1970s that remain strong todayPark learned about the coalition of business and politics from her father said Kim Dong-choon a professor of social sciences at Sungkonghoe University Parks watch stopped in the 1970s he saidThis homogeneous nation also pits friendship and loyalty against following the lawThis is a very communitarian society and theres an expectation that youre going to go with the flow said Scott Snyder a Korea specialist at the Council on Foreign RelationsIn America friendships are run as contractual relationships and people know the boundaries operate within social rules of etiquette that generate a little more distance Snyder saidBut in South_Korea creating this kind of distance is contrary to the bond of friendship The concept of butak literally favor but with a deep sense of obligation and expectation attached means that it is hard to say no when a friend asks you for something This concept makes it difficult to create checks and balances that can overcome personal networks Snyder saidInstitutions end up being compromised by the fact that Mr Kim at the Blue_House went to elementary school with Mr Lee at the prosecutors office he said Thats the classic struggle that makes corruption endemicThis scandal comes just after South_Korea enacted a new law designed to root out bribery and corruption prohibiting people from spending more_than $27 on a meal for public officials employees of state-run companies or journalistsBut that law was designed to target corruption at the lower end of the scale doing little to address the kinds of issues raised in Choi-gate as it is known hereAlmost two-thirds of people surveyed by the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission in 2014 said they thought South_Korean society was corruptTackling this problem will not be easy said Lee Tae-ho of Peoples Solidarity for Participatory Democracy an activist organizationWe are calling for Parks resignation but because there are many structural problems we are calling for citizens to help solve this problem he said The solutions should come from the political sphere but the political sphere also has problemsLee noted that some left-wing parties had been bannedKim Dong-choon the social scientist said This is not just about Parks and Chois misdeeds but other forces the prosecutorial system the bureaucratic system and the shortcomings that have made this incident possibleThis is a great opportunity for Koreans to rebuild our society and our politics Kim said to overcome old ways of thinking Yoonjung_Seo contributed to this reportHe was he insisted just an academic who had absolutely no contact with the Russian_government Any suggestion that he had offered to play matchmaker between the future president of the United_States and the power players of the Kremlin was he maintained dismissively incredibleOr so he told reportersBut in private exchanges Joseph Mifsud was proud of his alleged high-level Moscow contacts reporting that they had extended all the way to the top Hed had he told a former assistant late last_year a private meeting with Russian President_Vladimir PutinThe assistant didnt think much of that claim But the boastfulness matches the portrait of Mifsud sketched in court_papers unsealed_Monday that have made him one of the most critical and enigmatic figures in s investigation_into Russian_interference in the 2016 US election In those papers a plea agreement for former Trump campaign foreign_policy adviser_George Papadopoulos Mifsud is not named But the Maltese national and London-based academic confirmed Tuesday that he is the professor mentioned in the probeAccording to the court files the professor took an interest in Papadopoulos after the latter joined the Trump campaign Mifsud promised him dirt on Hillary_Clinton compiled by the Russians including thousands of emails He also offered to serve as a go-between in Papadopouloss efforts to connect the Trump campaign with the Kremlin even going so_far as introducing Papadopoulos to a woman he identified as Putins nieceWhether Mifsud really had the sort of Kremlin contacts that Papadopoulos claims he advertised is unknown But of how the Trump campaign regarded Mifsuds apparent approach and whether it yielded anything substantive could be a key focus of Muellers investigationMifsud who is in his mid-50s insisted Tuesday that the claims embedded in the court_documents are exaggerated echoing points he had made months earlier in response to inquiries from The Washington PostI have a clear conscience Mifsud told Britains Daily TelegraphMifsud told the Telegraph that he knew nothing about emails containing dirt on Clinton calling the allegations upsetting He also dismissed the disclosure that he introduced Papadopoulos to a female Russian national calling the allegation a laughingstockIn emails to The_Post in response to questions in August Mifsud had played down his connections to Moscow insisting they were purely related to his work as a professorI am an academic I do not even speak Russian he wroteBut the details that emerged Tuesday based on interviews with those who know him his writings and his travels suggested a more complex picture one that better matched the image of the professor in court files as a somewhat obscure European academic who longed for moreHailing from Malta the European Unions smallest nation he parlayed roles advising the government there into top positions with educational institutions that bear exalted-sounding names but are little-known even within academia Those included president of the Slovenia-based Euro-Mediterranean University and honorary director at the London Academy of DiplomacyNatalia Kutepova-Jamom his onetime assistant at the academy said he had set out in 2014 to build his contacts with Russian academics and policymakersShe said that she booked her former boss a speaking slot in 2014 at the Sochi meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club a Russian state-funded think_tank that is seen as close to the Kremlin to speak on economic and international cooperationMifsud later suggested to her that he used those early contacts to open doors for higher-level meetings But she was in disbelief when he told her last_year that his contacts had reached all the way to Putin with whom Mifsud claimed to have had a short private meetingShe said she didnt believe the two met because Mifsud is a too small-time person to meet with the Russian leaderBut Mifsud himself had written about being in the room with Putin to hear him speak at a 2015 event hosted by the Valdai Discussion Club and reported that he had asked a question of Foreign Minister Sergei LavrovIn that piece for Valdais website he wrote approvingly of Russias policy in Syria saying Putin had walked the talk The US administration of then-President Barack_Obama by contrast was on the defensiveIn a spring 2016 piece about the same_time he was allegedly meeting with Papadopoulos he asserted that he knew Russia quite wellOnline biographies present Mifsud as an authority in the field of international relations and diplomacy across Europe the United_States Russia Africa and the Mediterranean region But his academic work in these areas appears limited He has published in peer-reviewed journals on Maltese education policiesAccording to a biography on the London Centre of International Law Practices website which was deleted Sunday Mifsud served prominently in Maltas Ministry of Foreign_Affairs and worked as an adviser for Maltas Ministry of EducationScotlands University of Stirling said in an emailed statement that Mifsud joined its politics department in May this year as a full-time professorial teaching fellowFormer colleagues said they didnt think of Mifsud as someone with any particular Russian expertiseNabil Ayad who hired Mifsud as an honorary director at the London Academy of Diplomacy where Ayad was founder and director said Mifsuds focus was broadly in the area of diplomacyAs assistant to the Maltese foreign_minister he traveled to many countries and met many heads of state Ayad saidAyad said the institutions work involved occasional trips to Moscow including for collaboration with the Diplomatic Academy of the Russian Foreign MinistryWe tend to deal with governments so I dont_think he has any special connections or relationships Ayad said If a meeting took_place between a Russian official or he introduced someone it must have been by chance not by designBut Mifsud had occasionally gone beyond the role of the typical academic In 2015 he was an observer for elections in Kazakhstan that were sharply criticized by independent groups Mifsuds take was far rosier mirroring the Russian lineThe election he told Kazakh media was consistent with all international normsAt many polling stations was an image that I associate with a family meeting he reported Mifsud told that he introduced Papadopoulos to a program director of the Russian International_Affairs Council a state-funded Russian think_tank that is close to the Foreign_Ministry and that he tried to set_up meetings with experts on the European UnionWe are academics Mifsud told the paper We work closely with everybodyHe said that he met Papadopoulos in Italy in March_2016 and then 10 days later in LondonMifsuds contacts in Moscow go back to at_least 2012 when a delegation from Moscow State Universitys Faculty of Global Processes established a partnership with the London Diplomatic Academy according to publications by the university faculty and a newsletter founded by order of the Russian Ministry of Foreign AffairsBetween 2013 and 2017 Mifsud visited Moscow State University about once each year giving lectures and posing for photographs with the department head Ilya IlyinThe nature of the partnership was not immediately clear although Mifsud had discussed exchange programs and joint research projects The department advertises itself as a stepping stone for graduates to work in the Russian_government the presidential administration federal ministries and agencies the special services and outside of government Alexei Andreev the deputy director of the faculty said in a promotional videoReached on Tuesday by telephone Alexeev played down the departments ties to MifsudI think he is one of those people who has a lot of connections he said Krohn reported from Atlanta and Witte from Berlin Brian Murphy in Washington Andrew Roth and David_Filipov in Moscow and Isaac Stanley-Becker in Oxford England contributed to this reportSEOUL Kim_Jong Uns_regime defied international warnings and conducted a fourth_nuclear test last_month one it claimed was of a hydrogen_bomb and then launched a long-range rocket this month widely viewed as part of its missile programThe international_community has condemned the moves as and has declared that North_Korea must pay for its actions Some countries including South_Korea Japan and the United_States have taken direct action while negotiations continue in the United_Nations on a package of measures that could pass the Security_Council where China and Russia are veto-wielding permanent members Many Western nations together with South_Korea and Japan want tough sanctions but China is concerned about destabilizing its neighbor and has previously insisted on watering down any measures against North_Korea Heres a rundown on the sanctions that are in place against North_Korea as of Feb 19President Obama has enacted the North_Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 which passed the House and Senate with almost unanimous supportDaniel Wertz of the National_Committee on North_Korea has produced an excellent readable summary of the legislation Essentially the lawThe Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control has repeatedly taken action since President George_W Bush signed an executive_order in 2008 that declared the North_Korean threat to the United StatesThe sanctions have targeted specific North_Korean institutions and people who are alleged to be involved in developing or financing the Norths weapons programs They ban these companies and people from doing business in the United_States and American companies and people from doing business with themThe OFAC has produced a helpful summary of all its actions to dateThe UN_Security Council has passed four resolutions against North_Korea since Pyongyang conducted its first nuclear_test in 2006 The kind people at the Arms Control Association have compiled a comprehensive summary An even more succinct summary looks like this2006 Resolution 1718 banned North_Korea from conducting further nuclear_tests and prohibited supplying North_Korea with technology and training related to nuclear_weapons development2009 Resolution 1874 imposed after the second nuclear_test tightened sanctions on specific people and companies and expanded the crackdown on arms exports and imports Member states were encouraged to inspect and destroy any cargo on ships suspected of violating the arms embargoJanuary 2013 Resolution 2087 which followed a successful satellite launch strengthened previous sanctions by clarifying a states right to seize and destroy material suspected of heading to or from North_Korea for purposes of weapons development or researchMarch 2013 Resolution 2094 came after North_Koreas third nuclear_test It imposed new financial sanctions aimed_at hindering money transfers and shutting Pyongyang out of the international financial systemSouth Korea imposed unilateral sanctions against North_Korea following the 2010 attack on a Southern naval corvette the Cheonan that killed 46 sailors These sanctions known as the May 24 measures includedPresident Park_Geun-hye has now in retaliation for the January nuclear_test and February rocket launchJapan had lifted some of its direct sanctions on North_Korea as the two_countries embarked on discussions about a decades-old abduction program run by North_Korea But as the talks stalled Japan reimposed some of the measures and then added new ones after the recent provocationsThese are the latest measures as The European_Union has imposed rounds of sanctions on North_Korea over the last decade These includeThe full list can be viewedTOKYO North_Korea Friday Heres what we know so farYes it really was a nuclear_test The US Geological Survey said the 53 magnitude seismic event it recorded had explosion-like characteristics and occurred where North_Korea has detonated nuclear devices in the past The Norths first nuclear_test was in 2006and three have been carried_out since Kim_Jong Un took power in late 2011The quake had all the hallmarks of an explosion the waveform is sudden unlike an earthquake and the depth is shallow Plus it happened at a known North_Korean nuclear_test siteHeres a good explanationHow do nuclear blasts differ from natural earthquakes Lawrence Livermore describes [PDF] USGS (@USGS) Not necessarily North_Korea announced that they had conducted a nuclear explosion test and that they had standardized a nuclear_warhead Just because theyre right on the former doesnt mean theyre right on the latterMaking a nuclear_warhead small and light enough to attach to a missile is a difficult thing Analysts and military chiefs think North_Korea is well on the way to this capability but theres no sign they are there yetAnd even if they do manage to miniaturize a nuclear device and stick it on a missile theres still a whole lot more steps to go through A nuclear missile goes through extremes of heat and cold shakes with vibrations during launch and has to survive re-entry and hit its target Theres a lot of things that can go wrong thereBut North_Korea is And its latest nuclear_test does constitute another step down the path to what some people think is Pyongyangs ultimate aim being able to send a nuclear-tipped missile to the US mainlandSorry about that But its true that this is a pretty scary situation Kim_Jong Un has made it clear that hes determined to make North_Korea a nuclear state and hes certainly shown no inclination to return to diplomatic negotiations aimed_at persuading him to give up his weapons programs The example always cited in North_Korea analyst circles is Libya Moammar Gaddafi gave up his nukes and look what_happened to himBut heres a nice graphic from the AFP news_agency putting North_Koreas nuclear blasts in historical perspective How do North_Koreas nuclear_tests measure up AFP news_agency (@AFP) Well China is one country that has real leverage over North_Korea given that it provides economic aid to its neighbor and is its main route for trading with the rest of the world China is always concerned about stability on its borders and has shown itself to prioritize keeping North_Korea afloat over punishing Kim and his croniesThat said China seems pretty angry right_now North_Korea fired three missiles on Monday while Chinese president Xi_Jinping was hosting the Group of 20 summit in Hangzhou and those missiles were technically capable of hitting Hangzhou Not a subtle messageOn Friday Chinas foreign ministry released a statement condemning the test and saying it would work with the international_community to urge North_Korea to return to talks and give up its nukesThe question now is whether China gets serious about enforcing sanctionsFriday marks the Day of the Foundation of the Republic a public holiday commemorating the 68 anniversary of the formation of the North_Korean government by Kim_Il Sung North_Koreas founding president and the current leaders grandfather So its an important day for the regimeBut the test could also have been timed to push back at speculation that the regime is showing cracks after a handful of high-level defections including the and a couple of officials involved in making money for the Kim familyIt could also be a signal to the outside_world that North_Korea wont be cowed The United_States will send an anti-missile battery to South_Korea and China has been supporting UN statements deploring North_Koreas recent actions This is Kim_Jong Uns way of saying youre not the boss of meJapanese sniffer planes went up Friday and there are probably some American ones flying around too Theyll be trying to measure radiation levels and capture gases so nuclear scientists can draw some conclusions about the test Lets see if any gases escape the test tunnel that would give away the nature of the device says Joshua Pollack editor of the Nonproliferation ReviewThen it will be back to the UN_Security Council We can expect meetings and harshly worded statements out of the United_Nations and a push for more sanctions But the question is What else can the international_community do There have been lots of new sanctions_imposed this year a crackdown on mineral exports increased cargo inspections tougher financial limitations and clearly none of them have made Kim_Jong Un stop with the missiles and the nuclear testsThere arent many other options A military strike is out no one has any appetite for another war and striking North_Korea would probably unleash a volley of artillery by the North across the Demilitarized Zone at Seoul home to 20 million peopleTheres another option flooding North_Korea with trade and investment and information and trying that way to convince them to change But with all this defiance theres even less appetite for engagement than there is for military actionIts a classic North_Korean announcement This is Ri Chun Hee a veteran newsreader who was brought out of retirement in January to announce the fourth_nuclear test When she shows up you know its bigWealthy Americans appear to have found a way to get around one of the taxes they are supposed to be paying under Obamacare according tofederal dataThe nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxationa congressional agency published Tuesday projecting a surcharge on profitfrom rich taxpayers investments would produce less revenue thantheyd previously predicted Indeed thecommittee shaved about a quarter off its revenue projection from the one it submitted last_year cutting the estimate bymore than $60 billionThe committee as is typical for its guidelines did_not provide an explanation for the projection in reduced revenue but tax experts said they think it might bebecausethe wealthy aregetting around the lawThis tax on investments has been eroded over time as taxpayers have kind of figured out ways to put income into untaxed forms said Mark Mazur the director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center Taxpayers planning techniques change over time so you would see it in the estimates with a lagIn the last several years Treasury has reported that weve seen some significant tax avoidance said David Kamin a former economic adviser in Obamas White_House This may be one reason why JCT has reduced its estimateThe tax in question is a 38 percent fee on gains from certain investments but it only applies to individual taxpayers with more_than $200000 in annual incomeor to married couples making more_than $250000There are a few ways that wealthy taxpayers can avoid the tax One approach is for taxpayers to place investments in a legal entity known as an S corporation and then to pay themselvesa salary out of the corporations funds The S corporations profits are not technically salaries or wages so they are not subject to payroll taxes At the same_time because a taxpayer is an employee of their own corporation the profits do not qualify as the kind of indirect passive income that would be taxedIn calling for changes analysts in former president Barack_Obamas Treasury Department said that taxpayers who use this technique pay the tax on just 42 percent of the income from their S corporationsThere is an alternativepossible explanation for the drop in projected revenueMazur saidThe committee may be using a morepessimistic estimate of how_much profitwealthy taxpayers will see from theirinvestments and therefore how_much tax theyll pay on themWhatever the causethe committee projected that repealing the tax would eliminate $223 billion in revenue over the coming decade The committees new prediction is that a similar repeal would cost just $158 billion indicating that the staff expects substantially less money from the tax than theydid last yearPart of the discrepancy is thatlast year the committee estimated the effect of repealing the tax immediately while this year the committee considered a proposal to delay the repeal forone year The government would be able to collect some additional revenue during that extra yearThe change in thecommittees estimatehas political implications for Republicans as theywork to repeal Obamacare (officially known as theAffordable Care Act) including the laws tax oninvestment incomeRepublicans are usinga special procedural maneuver known as reconciliation toadvance their proposals through Congress The maneuver allows them to avoid a filibusterfrom Democrats in the Senate but it also requiresRepublicans to present a bill thatwould not result in more forecast borrowing by the federal governmentUnder the old estimate Republicans would have to find new spending cuts new revenue or some combination of the two to make up for the full $223 billion in projected lost revenue The new formula cuts the task down to making up only $158 billion in lost revenueThe Congressional Budget Office is expected to publish its official analysis incorporating the revisionin the coming daysRepublicans generally argue against increasing taxes on the wealthy to pay for social services such as the financial help offered to ordinary families buying health_insurance under ObamasAffordable Care_Act For Republicans these taxes penalize the rich for working investing and contributing to the economyBut Kamin Obamas former adviser argued that Republicans arepushing a giveaway to wealthy taxpayersThese are major tax cuts providing very significant tax relief to people at the top Kamin said of GOP plans to scrap the tax Instead he said the GOP should take the opportunity to simply close these loopholes so that this tax would raise the revenue that it was supposed to in the first placeThe unconventional administration of President Trump may be causing consternation among American liberals But here in Germany the anchor of the European_Union Trumps rise is helping fuel an unexpected surge of the leftWhat is happening in Germany is the kind of Trump bump perhaps never foreseen by his supporters a boost not for the German nationalists viewed as Trumps natural allies but for his fiercest critics in the center left The Social Democrats (SPD) have bounced back under the charismatic Martin Schulz the former head of the European Parliament who took over as party chairman last_month and is now staging a surprisingly strong bid to unseat Chancellor_Angela MerkelIn a country that stands as a painful example of the disastrous effects of radical nationalism Schulz is building a campaign in part around bold attacks on Trump He has stopped well short of direct comparisons to Adolf Hitler but Schulz recently mentioned Trump in the same speech in which he heralded his partys resistance to the Nazis in the lead-up to World_War II We will never give up our values our freedom and democracy no matter what challenges we are facing Schulz said in a recent speech He added That a US president wants to put up walls is thinking aloud about torture and attacks women religious communities minorities people with handicaps artists and intellectuals with brazen and dangerous comments is a breach of taboo thats unbearableHis anti-Trump platform comes as Germans are questioning American power more_than at any point since the end of the Cold War illustrating an erosion of allied faith in the new era of America first A recent poll found that only 22percent of Germans see the United_States led by Trump as a reliable partner putting it only one percentage point above RussiaThe in France and Britain But buoyed by Schulzs approach his party last_week pulled ahead of Merkels center-right Christian Democrats in opinion polls for the first time in six years Elections are not until September but analysts are giving the SPD under Schulz its best chances to regain power since Gerhard Schrder lost to Merkel in 2005There are different factors that are coming together for the SPD said Ralf Stegner the partys deputy chairman Schulz has provided a new impulse for people who were waiting to come back but also the new American president because Trumps presidency has politicized the German public making them more active and awareWithout naming names Merkel has taken aim at Trump criticizing for instance his refugee ban But Schulz has also accused Merkel of being too diplomatic Germany which shoulders the history of Nazi tyranny is an outlier in containing the current spread of me-first nationalism Even as far-right parties and isolationist politics gain ground elsewhere in Europe the largest right-wing populist party here the Alternative for Germany has fallen slightly in the polls since Trumps electionAt the same_time left-wing parties in Germany have seen a jump in dues-paying members There are also signs that Trumps election is making left-leaning voters in Germany more politically activeTake for instance Kristina Seidler a 28-year-old mother and Dsseldorf resident who works as a substantiality adviser for a textile company She has voted for the SPD before But the day after Trumps victory she signed up as a dues-paying member and party volunteerHorrified by Trumps win she said she sees the traditional left as the only answer and is preparing to put up posters and help with campaigning as the German election season rolls into high gearWhat kind of sign is it for the world when a man who is a racist who treats women so badly can become the president of the United_States Seidler said I thought Its time for me to do somethingPerhaps the biggest single driver of the SPDs new popularity however is SchulzThe SPD is already part of Merkels governing grand coalition with the partys senior operatives filling top cabinet posts Yet its popularity with its left-leaning base has been hampered by that power-sharing deal Under its former chairman Sigmar Gabriel Merkels foreign_minister the SPD was struggling to distance itself from the current governmentEnter Schulz who last_month took over as the partys chairman and candidate positioning himself as an outsider who could mix things up in Berlin A 61-year-old who never finished high school Schulz has embraced his imperfections openly speaking about his battle with alcoholism He started in local politics becoming the mayor of the western German town of Wrselen before being elected to the European Parliament in 1994He rose through the ranks as a champion of European unity civil_rights and social justice becoming the parliaments president in 2012 He has at times been chided for his tell-it-like-it-is approach drawing the wrath of the Hungarian and Polish governments after decrying democratic lapses in those countriesCritics call Schulz similar to Trump in at_least one regard He is a straight talker who argues against elites and favors the common man He is also blunt a trait that contrasts with Merkel a leader famous for her meandering parsed answersThe way in which he conjures up the alleged division of society in a populist manner is along the lines of the post-factual methods of the US election campaign Merkels finance minister Wolfgang Schuble charged in Der Spiegel last weekIn the dealmaking game that is coalition governments Schulz may have several paths to the chancellery if his party can maintain its momentum It will be difficult analysts say but Schulzs rising popularity means it is no_longer unthinkable that Merkel loses Merkels open-door policy for refugees brought a barrage of criticism from the conservative wing of her party And despite Merkels hesitance Horst Seehofer head of her sister party the Christian Social Union appears to be extending his hand to Trump praising the new presidents consistency and speed in implementing his campaign promisesA Merkel loss could mean a greater frost in German-U S relations harking back to the days of Schrders cool relationship with President George_W Bush Merkel while has nevertheless avoided outright conflict Analysts call that further evidence of her pragmatism and firm belief that Germany needs the United_States diplomatically and for collective defenseGoing after Trump might be a smart strategy for winning elections but not for running a government said Jrgen Falter a political scientist at Mainz University Stephanie Kirchner contributed to this reportRoy Moore arrived in the Capitol to play an unfamiliar role Republican conformist By the time he left he was once again a lightning rod for controversy The hard-right former judge made his second trip to Washington on Tuesday as his partys Senate nominee in Alabama Unlike Moore decided to mingle with the Republican establishment he has villainized on the campaign_trail He joined Republican senators at their weekly policy luncheon Most backed his opponent in the primary He chatted with Majority_Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) his bitter foeAfterward he refrained from reiterating his criticism of the Kentuckian Moore also dodged questions from reporters about incendiary statements he has made about a Muslim serving in Congress and gay people declaring that he was not there to answer any questions about issuesAs he made the rounds some of Moores potential future Republican colleagues strained to separate themselves from him One even attacked him head-on in a speech on the Senate floorThe visit offered a preview of the headaches Moores presence could cause for Senate Republican leaders should he prevail in a Dec 12 special election to fill the seat once held by Attorney_General Jeff SessionsI dont_know where Im_going right_now Moore told_reporters as he exited Tuesdays lunch and walked down a hallway near the Senate chamber before doubling back toward a bank of elevators Asked by one reporter whether he still thinks Rep Keith Ellison (D-Minn) should not be a member of Congress because hes Muslim as Moore wrote in a 2006 opinion piece Moore replied Ill address that laterDid he still think homosexual conduct should be illegal Im not answering any questions on issues right_now Moore saidHe said he spoke at lunch to McConnell whom he has vowed to oppose as leader But as he departed the second floor of the Capitol he said he was not going to give an opinion on that matter at that momentLess than two hours later Sen_Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) a frequent critic of the far-right and President Trump who is retiring at the end of this Congress used a floor speech in favor of a conservative judicial nominee to condemn MooreWhen the presidential nominee of my party the party of Lincoln called for a Muslim ban it was wrong and I said so said Flake When a judge expressed his personal belief that a Muslim should not be a member of Congress because of his faith it was wrong That this same judge is now my partys nominee for the Senate should concern us all Religious tests have no place in the United_States CongressMoores visit came amid an effort by Senate Republicans to criticize Democrats for what they have charged was anti-Catholic animus against judicial nominee Amy Coney Barrett a Catholic law professor who has questioned the legal rationale behind the Supreme_Court ruling on abortion in The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Barrett to serve on the US Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit Republicans have focused on Sen Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif) who accused Barrett at a hearing of letting dogma overwhelm legal reasoning and then expanded to attacking any Democrat who opposed BarrettBut some of the same lawmakers lodging that complaint have not forcefully criticized Moores past comment about Ellison adding awkwardness to their line of attack on the basis of religious libertyFor some Republican senators Moores appearance on Tuesday also created some discomfortAsked whether he supported Moore Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune (SD) responded Im hoping to meet with him while hes up here I havent had a chance to do that yet I dont_know himLike Trump and many other leading Republicans Thune backed Sen Luther Strange in the GOP primary that Moore wonHe stood up and was pleasant in his comments said Sen Bob Corker (R-Tenn) recalling Moores appearance at lunch But Corker wasnt won over and he did_not want to weigh in on Moores controversial positionsI plan on staying out of the election and the people of Alabama will determine that he said And I have nothing to do whatsoever with whats_happening in the Senate race in AlabamaMoore is scheduled to attend a fundraiser in Washington on Wednesday evening An invitation distributed by his campaign this month lists the names of prominent conservative activists and senators backing his campaign including Sen Mike Lee (R-Utah) But in a sign that Moore may not even be on the same page as some of his allies in Washington a spokesman for Lee said Tuesday that it was not on the senators to-do listTomorrows fundraiser is not on our schedule said the spokesman Conn CarrollThe first criminal charges stemming from the Russia investigation landed this week at a perilous point in Donald Trumps presidency threatening his standing with foreign leaders ahead of an important trip to Asia on Friday and his effectiveness in selling the Republican tax plan set to be released this weekAides insisted the twin challenges at home and abroad would not be undermined by the indictments but whose job approval ratings hit a new low this week in was evident Tuesday in which he lashed out at the media and Crooked Dems and urged a focus instead on the Massive Tax Cuts he has promised to deliver by ChristmasIn a bid to show he remains focused on the tasks at hand Trump later in the day allowed reporters to witness the start of a at which he boasted that the December signing of the yet-to-be-unveiled GOP tax bill would be the biggest tax event in the history of our countryBut special_counsel

crisis could distract from or complicate his message on a high-stakes 12-day trip to five Asian nations aimed_at building regional support for his bid to pressure North_Korea over its nuclear_weapons and ballistic_missile programsBeyond Trumps tweeting analysts said the issue could dominate the US press corps coverage of the trip with reporters asking him about the Mueller investigation on foreign soilMichael Green an Asia policy aide to President George_W Bush recalled the 43rd president being asked about the Iraq War during trips to Asia even as he attempted to sketch a vision of US engagement in the regionMy prediction is that it will be a story for the White_House press corps and then the Asian press will pick up on it like an echo chamber said Green who was in Japan when news of Muellers indictments broke Monday He added that having been on those trips it can be very very hard for the White_House to get their strategic and foreign_policy message throughTrump plans to visit Japan South_Korea China Vietnam and the Philippines engaging in bilateral meetings with a host of foreign leaders Aides have been briefing him heavilyThe trip comes as Chinese President_Xi Jinping has consolidated power on the heels of the Communist Partys National Congress creating another problematic narrative for TrumpTrump is by far the weakest leader in modern US history and Xi is by far the strongest leader said Ian Bremmer president of the Eurasia Group a global risk assessment firm Thats going to make the meeting uncomfortableBremmer who also was in Japan last_week at a security conference said Japanese officials are concerned that Trump could be motivated to take a more provocative stance on North_Korea or on US trade relations with South_Korea and China to distract from his domestic problemsUnlike past US leaders who have tried to stay on message in Asia while dealing with distractions at home Trump always wants to create a distraction Bremmer said To what extent will he play harder ball with the Chinese or North_Koreans or on trade And most importantly will he decide to really fulminate against the North_Koreans It is dangerous the combination of all thatBonnie Glaser a China expert_at the Center for Strategic and International_Studies was in Beijing last weekThe Chinese are worried that his domestic problems will cause Trump to do something internationally that will bolster his domestic position and distract people from his problems at home she saidThe biggest worry is an attack on North_Korea Glaser said Those who think he is not bluffing they think this is something they should be worried aboutIn interviews several prominent Republicans argued that the tax bill will rise or fall based on factors unrelated to Trumps level of distractionHeading into next years midterm elections Republicans in Congress are under tremendous pressure to show they can get something done with control of both chambers and the White HouseThis bill was never going to pass because Donald Trump went up to the Hill and negotiated it said Barry Bennett a GOP consultant who advised Trump during last years general election Its going to pass because Republicans have to pass it Theyre not really counting on much leadership from the presidentA senior Republican congressional aide largely echoed that sentiment and said lawmakers do not expect Trump to have much of an impact in the days following the bills introduction this week and its subsequent markup by the House Ways and Means Committee in a stretch when hell be out of the countryIts kind of an inside-the-cone process said the aide who requested anonymity to speak more candidly Im not sure how_much Trump would make a differenceBut the aide said there will be points later in the process that could benefit from presidential leadership including help selling the legislation to the public before the full House votes and navigating differences that emerge after the Senate passes a billThe aide also said lawmakers have become accustomed to having to navigate distractions created by the White HouseWhen this year have we not had some big story about Russia or something else supposedly looming over us the aide said This is kind of the new normalOther observers suggested the pervasiveness of the Russia probe which continued to dominate cable television news much of Tuesday will have a more significant impact on Capitol_Hill particularly if more indictments are handed down in coming weeksIt brings more chaos into an already chaotic situation where theyre operating on an almost impossible timeline to begin with said Jim Manley a lobbyist and longtime aide to then-Senate Minority Leader Harry M Reid (D-Nev)Manley and others also argued that Trump tends to lash out on Twitter when hes agitated and often not in a helpful wayLast week for instance he tweeted that the tax-cut plan would not include any changes to tax-deferred retirement accounts such as 401(k)s following reports last_week that House Republicans were weighing a sharp reduction in the amount of income American workers could save through such programsWhile they say they would welcome Democratic support leaders of both chambers are preparing to pass the bill with only Republican votes In the Senate where there are 52 Republicans that means the party can lose only two GOP votesThey dont have margin for error so it doesnt take much to get off track said John Weaver who was chief_strategist for the 2016_presidential campaign of Ohio Gov John Kasich (R)Doug Heye a GOP political consultant said the Mueller indictments have largely overshadowed what could have been a string of positive stories about Trumps week his push for tax cuts the expected announcement of a new Federal Reserve chairman on Thursday and a major trip abroadThis distraction makes it harder to see any successes they have Heye said It highlights a problem this administration had since the beginning staying out of its own wayRussian government hackers penetrated the computer network of the Democratic_National Committee and gained access to the entire database of opposition_research on GOP presidential_candidate Donald Trump according to committee officials and security experts who responded to the breachThe intruders so thoroughly compromised the DNCs system that they also were able to read all email and chat traffic said DNC officials and the security expertsThe intrusion into the DNC was one of several The networks of presidential candidates Hillary_Clinton and Donald Trump were also targeted by Russian spies as were the computers of some Republican political action committees US officials said But details on those cases were not available I completely rule out a possibility that the [Russian] government or the government bodies have been involved in this Dmitry Peskov the Kremlins spokesman told the Reuters news_agency in Moscow Some of the hackers had access to the DNC network for about a year but all were expelled over the past weekend in a major computer cleanup campaign the committee officials and experts saidThe DNC said that no financial donor or personal information appears to have been accessed or taken suggesting that the breach was traditional espionage not the work of criminal hackersThe intrusions are an example of Russias interest in the US political system and its desire to understand the policies strengths and weaknesses of a potential future president much as American spies gather similar information on foreign candidates and leadersThe depth of the penetration reflects the skill and determination of the United_States top cyber-adversary as Russia goes after strategic targets from the White_House and State_Department to political campaign organizations Its the job of every foreign intelligence service to collect intelligence against their adversaries said Shawn Henry president of CrowdStrike the cyber firm called in to handle the DNC breach and a former head of the FBIs cyber division He noted that it is extremely difficult for a civilian organization to protect itself from a skilled and determined state such as RussiaWere perceived as an adversary of Russia he said Their job when they wake up every day is to gather intelligence against the policies practices and strategies of the US government There are a variety of ways [Hacking] is one of the more valuable because it gives you a treasure trove of informationRussian President_Vladimir Putin who has called for better relations with Russia and expressed skepticism about NATO But unlike Clinton whom the Russians probably have long had in their spy sights Trump has not been a politician for very long so foreign agencies are playing catch-up analysts sayThe purpose of such intelligence gathering is to understand the targets proclivities said Robert Deitz former senior councillor to the CIA_director and a former general counsel at the National Security Agency Trumps foreign investments for example would be relevant to understanding how he would deal with countries where he has those investments should he be elected Deitz said They may provide tips for understanding his style of negotiating In short this sort of intelligence could be used by Russia for example to indicate where it can get away with foreign adventurism Other analysts noted that any dirt dug up in opposition_research is likely to be made public anyway Nonetheless DNC leadership acted quickly after the intrusions discovery to contain the damageThe security of our system is critical to our operation and to the confidence of the campaigns and state parties we work with said Rep Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla) the DNC chairwoman When we discovered the intrusion we treated this like the serious incident it is and reached out to CrowdStrike immediately Our team moved as quickly as possible to kick out the intruders and secure our network Clinton called the intrusion troubling in an interview with Telemundo She also said So far as we know my campaign has not been hacked into and added that cybersecurity is an issue that she will be absolutely focused on if she becomes president Because whether its Russia or China Iran or North_Korea more and more countries are using hacking to steal our information to use it to their advantage she said A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign referred questions to the Secret ServiceDNC leaders were tipped to the hack in late April Chief executive Amy Dacey got a call from her operations chief saying that their information technology team had noticed some unusual network activityIts never a call any executive wants to get but the IT team knew something was awry Dacey said And they knew it was serious enough that they wanted experts to investigateThat evening she spoke with Michael Sussmann a DNC lawyer who is a partner with Perkins_Coie in Washington Soon after Sussmann a former federal_prosecutor who handled computer crime cases called Henry whom he has known for many yearsWithin 24 hours CrowdStrike had installed software on the DNCs computers so that it could analyze data that could indicate who had gained access when and howThe firm identified two separate hacker groups both working for the Russian_government that had infiltrated the network said Dmitri Alperovitch CrowdStrike co-founder and chief technology officer The firm had analyzed other breaches by both groups over the past two years One group which CrowdStrike had dubbed Cozy Bear had gained access last_summer and was monitoring the DNCs email and chat communications Alperovitch saidThe other which the firm had named Fancy Bear broke into the network in late April and targeted the opposition_research files It was this breach that set off the alarm The hackers stole two files Henry said And they had access to the computers of the entire research staff an average of about several dozen on any given dayThe computers contained research going back years on Trump Its a huge job to dig into the dealings of somebody who has never run for office before Dacey saidCrowdStrike is not sure how the hackers got in The firm suspects they may have targeted DNC employees with spearphishing emails These are communications that appear legitimate often made to look like they came from a colleague or someone trusted but that contain links or attachments that when clicked on deploy malicious software that enables a hacker to gain access to a computer But we dont have hard evidence Alperovitch saidThe two groups did_not appear to be working together Alperovitch said Fancy Bear is believed to work for the GRU or Russias military intelligence service he said CrowdStrike is less sure of whom Cozy Bear works for but thinks it might be the Federal Security Service or FSB the countrys powerful security agency which was once headed by Putin The lack of coordination is not unusual he said Theres an amazing adversarial relationship among the Russian intelligence_agencies Alperovitch said We have seen them steal assets from one another refuse to collaborate Theyre all vying for power to sell Putin on how good they areThe two crews have superb operational tradecraft he said They often use previously unknown software bugs known as zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise applications In the DNCs case the hackers constantly switched tactics to maintain a stealthy presence inside the network and used built-in Windows tools so that they didnt have to resort to malicious code that might trigger alerts They flew under the radar Alperovitch saidThe two groups have hacked government agencies tech companies defense contractors energy and manufacturing firms and universities in the United_States Canada and Europe as well as in Asia he saidCozy Bear for instance compromised the unclassified email systems of the White_House State_Department and Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2014 Alperovitch saidThis is a sophisticated foreign intelligence service with a lot of time a lot of resources and is interested in targeting the US political system Henry said He said the DNC was not engaged in a fair fight Youve got ordinary citizens who are doing hand-to-hand combat with trained military officers he said And thats an untenable situationRussia has always been a formidable foe in cyberspace but in the past two years theres been a thousand-fold increase in its espionage campaign against the West said Alperovitch who is also a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council They feel under siegeWestern sanctions_imposed after Russias annexation of Crimea in Ukraine have hurt the economy and led the government to increase its theft of intellectual property to limit the impact of import restrictions he said And Russias growing isolation has increased the need for intelligence to understand and influence political decisions in other countries he addedCrowdStrike is continuing the forensic investigation said Sussmann the DNC lawyer But at this time it appears that no financial information or sensitive employee donor or voter information was accessed by the Russian attackers he saidThe firm has installed special software on every computer and server in the network to detect any efforts by the Russian cyberspies to break in again When they get kicked out of the system Henry predicted theyre going to try to come back in Tom Hamburger contributed to this reportFormer Trump campaign co-chairman Sam_Clovis is facing renewed opposition to his nomination to serve as the Agriculture Departments chief_scientist amid revelations that he encouraged a campaign adviser to foster ties with Russian officialsOn Tuesday several thousand scientists and researchers affiliated with two national organizations that have rallied against Cloviss nomination signed letters urging the Senate Committee on Agriculture Nutrition and Forestry not to confirm him calling him unfit for the post The former conservative radio talk-show host from Iowa was already a controversial choice to be the departments chief_scientist Clovis who is not a trained scientist is a climate_change skeptic who protecting gay rights could lead to the legalization of pedophilia In every aspect Clovis falls far short of the standards demanded by the position the Union of Concerned Scientists wrote in a one-page to the committees chairman Sen Pat Roberts (R-Kan) and the panels top Democrat Sen Debbie Stabenow (Mich) The letter had 3100 signers Mike Lavender senior Washington representative for the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists said in a statement that emerging evidence of Clovis potential involvement with the Trump campaigns Russian connections should be the final nail in the coffin for his confirmationThe Center for Science in the Public Interest sent the committee a similar letter Tuesday A lawyer for Clovis who is currently a senior White_House adviser to the Agriculture Department did_not respond to a request for commentThe new round of opposition came after Clovis was identified as by foreign_policy adviser_George Papadopoulos to broker a relationship with Russian officials Court documents unsealed_Monday revealed that Papadopoulos in early October to making false_statement to FBI investigators about his contacts with foreigners claiming to have high-level Russian connectionsIn August 2016 Clovis encouraged Papadopoulos to organize an off the record meeting with Russian officials according to court_documents I would encourage

Washington_Post on Monday that her client always vigorously opposed any Russian trip for Donald Trump and/or the campaign She said his responses to Papadopoulos were a courtesy by a polite gentleman from Iowa Clovis is likely to face questions about his interactions with Papadopoulos during his Senate hearing which had been tentatively scheduled for Nov9The emerging information about his role in the Trump campaigns interactions with Russia raises serious concerns Stabenow said in a statement As we consider his nomination I will be looking into these facts along with his questionable qualifications and long history of divisive and outrageous statementsRoberts spokeswoman Meghan Cline declined to comment on the opposition to Clovis saying that we are working on scheduling details and will announce a date for a nominations hearing soonA former economics professor at Morningside College in Iowa Clovis made an unsuccessful run for the US Senate in 2014 He served_as one of Trumps first campaign policy advisers In a 2014 interview with Iowa Public Radio he said he was extremely skeptical about climate_change Clovis took a leave of absence from his position at Morningside College in 2015 to join the Trump campaign as a chief policy_adviser He helped develop Trumps campaign proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United_States drawing from some university

position that oversees the agencys extensive scientific mission The chief_scientist also oversees the economic bureaus including the Natural Agricultural Statistics Service and the Economic Research Service Clovis has a BS in political science an MBA and a PhD in public administration according to the White_House But the undersecretary for research job has traditionally been held by people with

experience in agricultural research_education and economics The measure noted that the job is responsible for the coordination of the research_education and extension activities of the Department Tom Hamburger contributed to this reportSeveral GOP senators said Tuesday they will not support any efforts to cut the funding or otherwise curtail special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_IIIs investigation_into Russia meddling in the 2016 electionMy basic philosophy is once you have an independent counsel you ought to give him a chance to follow the facts said Sen Richard C Shelby (R-Ala) a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the chairman of the subcommittee that handles the Justice Departments funding If somebodys doing a job you dont_want to cut it offI would not support that He needs to continue to investigate said Sen_Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) who last_week excoriated Trumps governing style in a speech announcing plans to retire at the end of next yearI would oppose said Sen John McCain (R-Ariz) one of the presidents most vocal critics in Congress And so would the American peopleThose voices and others reflect an emerging Republican message for dealing with the Mueller investigation Stay away from it and warn Trump to do the same There would be an uprising at the Capitol like never seen before if any kind of interference looked like it was taking place said Sen Bob Corker (R-Tenn) Regardless of which side of the aisle Thats just beyond the paleThose reactions came amid evidence that some Republican lawmakers would like to curtail or at_least redirect the ongoing investigations into Russian_interference including several congressional inquiries Some Republican senators and House members for instance have heeded the presidents call in recent_weeks to launching new inquiries into a uranium_deal with Russia that President_Barack Obamas administration approved in 2010 Trump used the uranium_deal as a political cudgel against Hillary_Clinton on the campaign_trail despite scant evidence she had personally played a role in the decision At least three congressional_committees in the House and Senate are also continuing to look into how the Federal Bureau of Investigation handled Clintons email scandalBut even those Republicans calling for more attention to those new probes dont_want to touch Muellers fundsI dont_want to deny the Justice_Department or special_counsel resources they need said Senate_Judiciary Committee member John Kennedy (R-La) just moments after telling reporters he believed the uranium probes deserved more attention Now I dont_want to see them just go hog wild and waste money either But I dont_want to try to do anything to hurt their effortCorker said there was no talk about the Mueller investigation at Tuesdays weekly GOP policy luncheon Most Republican lawmakers said they dont believe that Trump will fire Mueller or defund or otherwise upend his investigationThe idea that Bob Mueller is going to have the scope of his inquiry constrained or be otherwise restricted is really out there said Sen Susan Collins (R-Maine) I_think thats extremely unlikelySo long as there are no signs that will change Republican leaders will_continue trying to keep their focus on the legislative agenda which at the moment is all about tax reform In the Senate GOP leaders are also aiming to confirm a slate of judicial nominees a top priority for many conservative activists The special_counsel has his job to do The job we have here in the Senate is the investigation being carried_out by the intelligence committee said Senate Majority_Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) in his first public comments since the first charges from Muellers inquiry were recently revealed One Republican in frequent contact with GOP lawmakers said Tuesday that there was an emerging consensus among them that the only way to head off a bloodbath in next years midterm elections is to pass a tax bill So they are trying to keep all their energy on that goal and shut out most everything else I_think all these guys are running for their political lives said the Republican who was granted anonymity to speak candidly Still some are raising alarm bells about Muellers findings I guarantee you more shoes will drop said McCain He added later I guarantee you the scandals not over Paul Kane contributed to this reportRussias ambassador to Washington told his superiors in Moscow that he discussed campaign-related matters including policy issues important to Moscow with Jeff_Sessions during the 2016_presidential race contrary to public assertions by the embattled attorney_general according to current and former US officialsAmbassador Sergey Kislyaks accounts of two conversations with Sessions then a top foreign_policy adviser to Republican candidate Donald Trump were intercepted by US spy agencies which monitor the communications of senior Russian officials in the United_States and in Russia Sessions initially failed to disclose his contacts with Kislyak and then said that the meetings were not about the Trump campaignOne US official said that Sessions who testified that he had no recollection of an April encounter has provided misleading statements that are contradicted by other evidence A former official said that the intelligence indicates that Sessions and Kislyak had substantive discussions on matters including Trumps positions on Russia-related issues and prospects for US-Russia relations in a Trump administrationSessions has said repeatedly that he never discussed campaign-related issues with Russian officials and that it was only in his capacity as a US senator that he met with KislyakI never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign when he announced that he would recuse_himself from matters relating to the FBI probe of Russian_interference in the election and any connections to the Trump campaign Current and former US officials said that that assertion is at odds with Kislyaks accounts of conversations in two encounters during the campaign one in April ahead of Trumps first major foreign_policy speech and another in July on the sidelines of the Republican National ConventionThe apparent discrepancy could pose new problems for Sessions as his position in the administration appears increasingly tenuousTrump expressed frustration with Sessionss recusing himself from the Russia probe and indicated regret at making the lawmaker from Alabama the nations top law_enforcement officer Trump also faulted Sessions as giving bad answers during his confirmation_hearing about his Russia contacts during the campaignOfficials emphasized that the information contradicting Sessions comes from US intelligence on Kislyaks communications with the Kremlin and they acknowledged that the Russian_ambassador could have mischaracterized or exaggerated the nature of his interactionsObviously I cannot comment on the reliability of what anonymous sources describe in a wholly uncorroborated intelligence intercept that the Washington_Post has not seen and that has not been provided to me said a Justice_Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores in a statement She reasserted that Sessions did_not discuss interference in the electionRussian and other foreign diplomats in Washington and elsewhere have been known at times to report false or misleading information to bolster their standing with their superiors or to confuse US intelligence agenciesBut US officials with regular access to Russian intelligence reports say Kislyak whose tenure as ambassador to the United_States ended recently was known for accurately relaying details about his interactions with officials in WashingtonSessions removed himself from direct involvement in the Russia investigation after it was revealed in The Washington_Post that he had met with Kislyak at_least twice in 2016 contacts he failed to disclose during his confirmation_hearing in JanuaryI did_not have communications with the Russians Sessions said when asked whether anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign had communicated with representatives of the Russian governmentHe has since maintained that he misunderstood the scope of the question and that his meetings with Kislyak were strictly in his capacity as a US senator In a March appearance on Fox television Sessions said I dont recall any discussion of the campaign in any significant waySessions appeared to narrow that assertion further saying that he never met with or had any conversation with any Russians or foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United StatesBut when pressed for details during that hearing Sessions qualified many of his answers by saying that he could not recall or did_not have any recollectionA former US official who read the Kislyak reports said that the Russian_ambassador reported speaking with Sessions about issues that were central to the campaign including Trumps positions on key policy matters of significance to MoscowSessions had a third meeting with Kislyak in his Senate office in September Officials declined to say whether US intelligence_agencies intercepted any Russian communications describing the third encounterAs a result the discrepancies center on two earlier Sessions-Kislyak conversations including one that Sessions has acknowledged took_place in July 2016 on the sidelines of the Republican National ConventionBy that point Russian President_Vladimir Putin had decided to embark on a secret campaign to help Trump win the White_House by leaking damaging emails about Trumps rival Democrat Hillary_Clinton according to US intelligence agenciesAlthough it remains unclear how involved Kislyak was in the covert Russian campaign to aid Trump his superiors in Moscow were eager for updates about the candidates positions particularly regarding US sanctions on Russia and long-standing disputes with the Obama_administration over conflicts in Ukraine and SyriaKislyak also reported having a conversation with Sessions in April_2016 at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington where then-candidate Trump delivered his first major foreign_policy address according to the officials familiar with intelligence on KislyakSessions has said he does_not remember any encounter with Kislyak at that event In his June testimony before the Senate_Intelligence Committee Sessions said I do not recall any conversations with any Russian official at the Mayflower HotelLater in that hearing Sessions said that its conceivable that that occurred I just dont remember itKislyak also was a key figure in who was forced to leave that job after The_Post revealed that he had discussed US sanctions against Russia with Kislyak even while telling others in the Trump administration that he had not done soIn that case however Flynns phone conversations with Kislyak were intercepted by US intelligence providing irrefutable evidence The intelligence on Sessions by contrast is based on Kislyaks accounts and not corroborated by other sourcesFormer FBI_director James_B Comey fueled speculation about the possibility of a Sessions-Kislyak meeting at the Mayflower when he told the same Senate committee on June8 that the FBI had information about Sessions that would have made it problematic for him to be involved in overseeing the Russia probeComey would not provide details of what information the FBI had except to say that he could discuss it only privately with the senators Current and former officials said he appeared to be alluding to intelligence on Kislyaks account of an encounter with Sessions at the MayflowerSenate Democrats later called on the FBI to investigate the event in April at the Mayflower hotelSessionss role in removing Comey as FBI_director angered many at the bureau and set in motion events that led to the appointment of former FBI_director Robert_S Mueller_III as a special_counsel overseeing the Russia probeTrumps harsh words toward the attorney_general fueled speculation this week that Sessions would be fired or would resign So far he has resisted resigning saying that he intends to stay in the job as long as that is appropriate Matt Zapotosky and Julie Tate contributed to

the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian_government in the course of the 2016 campaignIm not aware of any of those activities he responded He added I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did_not have communications with the Russians Officials said Sessions did_not consider the conversations relevant to the lawmakers questions and did_not remember in detail what he discussed with KislyakThere was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer said Sarah Isgur Flores Sessionss spokeswomanIn January Sen Patrick J Leahy (D-Vt) asked Sessions for answers to

to public assertions by Mike_Pence the vice president-elect and other top Trump officials Flynn was forced to resign the following week When asked to comment on Sessionss contacts with Kislyak Franken said in a statement to The_Post on Wednesday If its true that Attorney_General Sessions met with the Russian_ambassador in the midst of the campaign then I am very troubled that his response to my questioning during his confirmation_hearing was at best misleading Franken added It is now clearer than ever that the attorney_general cannot in good faith oversee an investigation at the Department of Justice and the FBI of the Trump-Russia connection and he must recuse_himself immediatelySeveral Democratic members of the House on Wednesday night called on Sessions to resign from his post After

Russian_ambassador proved to be improper or suspect he too would join the call for Sessions to recuse_himself from the investigationIf there is something there and it goes up the chain of investigation it is clear to me that Jeff_Sessions who is my dear friend cannot make that decision about Trump Graham said although he stressed that Sessionss contacts with the Russian_ambassador could have been innocentBut if theres something there that the FBI thinks is criminal in nature then for sure you need a special prosecutor If that day ever comes Ill be the first one to say it needs to be somebody other than Jeff Current and former US officials say they see Kislyak as a diplomat not an intelligence operative But they were not sure to what extent if any Kislyak was aware of or involved in the covert Russian election campaignSteven Hall former head of Russia operations at the CIA said that Russia would have been keenly interested in cultivating a relationship with Sessions because of his role on key congressional_committees and as an early adviser to TrumpSessionss membership on the Armed_Services Committee would have made him a priority for the Russian_ambassador The fact that he had already placed himself at_least ideologically behind Trump would have been an added bonus for Kislyak Hall saidMichael McFaul a Stanford University professor who until 2014 served_as US ambassador to Russia said he was not surprised that Kislyak would seek a meeting with Sessions The weird part is to conceal it he said That was at the height of all the discussions of what Russia was doing during the electionTwo months before the September meeting Sessions attended a Heritage Foundation event in July on the sidelines of the Republican National_Convention that was attended by about 50 ambassadors When the event was over a small group of ambassadors approached Sessions as he was leaving the podium and Kislyak was among them the Justice_Department official said Sessions then spoke individually to some of the ambassadors including Kislyak the official said In the informal exchanges the ambassadors expressed appreciation for his remarks and some of them invited him to

bad leader Sessions told CNN We have a lot of bad leaders around the world that operate in ways we would never tolerate in the United_States But the question is can we have a more peaceful effective

emblazoned on dozens of properties around the worldWhat does it take to secure these properties And if Trump continues to retreat to Mar-a-Lago with some regularity whats the cost to the American taxpayerThe Posts helps us answer these questions in todays episode Plus we delve into the mystique of the White_House the politics of presidential travel and how Trump is challenging some long-standing norms of the highest office in the countryNorth Korea claimed Wednesday that it had successfully tested a hydrogen_bomb a claim that if true would mark a huge step forward in its nuclear capabilityWeve carried_out a hydrogen_bomb test a newsreader on the state-run Korean_Central Television station announced in a special broadcast from PyongyangNorth Korea was forced to develop its nuclear arsenal because of the USs hostile policy against North_Korea she said There was some skepticism about the claim with nuclear experts noting that the yield appeared to be similar to North_Koreas three previous atomic tests rather_than the enormous yield that would be expected if it had been a thermonuclear testWe are aware of seismic activity on the Korean_Peninsula in the vicinity of a known North_Korean nuclear_test site and have seen Pyongyangs claims of a nuclear_test said John Kirby a spokesman at the State_Department We are monitoring and continuing to assess the situation in close coordination with our regional partnersEither way Pyongyangs provocative action will present a new challenge to the outside_world which has struggled to find ways to end North_Koreas nuclear defianceNorth Koreas fourth test in the context of repeated statements by US Chinese and South_Korean leaders throws down the gauntlet to the international_community to go beyond paper resolutions and find a way to impose real costs on North_Korea for pursuing this course of action said Scott Snyder a Korea expert_at the Council on Foreign RelationsKim Jong_Uns regime to defend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nation Some analysts were doubtful saying the young leader appeared primarily concerned with trying to bolster his legitimacyBut on Wednesday North_Korea said in a special broadcast that it had carried_out a successful hydrogen_bomb test With this hydrogen_bomb test we have joined the major nuclear powers the newsreader saidHydrogen or thermonuclear bombs are exponentially more powerful and destructive than atomic devices An atomic bomb uses fission to break up the atomic nucleus and release energy while a hydrogen or thermonuclear bomb uses fusion to add to the nucleus This leads to an enormous explosion resulting from an uncontrolled self-sustaining chain reactionKim has repeatedly asserted and has resolutely refused to return to multilateral talks North_Korea had conducted three nuclear_tests since 2006 but only one during Kims reign in February 2013 Then there were signs of unusual seismic activity around North_Koreas main nuclear_test site Wednesday morning sparking fears that Pyongyang ordered the detonation of another atomic device two days before Kims birthdayWe have consistently made clear that we will not accept [North Korea] as a nuclear state Kirby said We will_continue to protect and defend our allies in the region including the Republic of Korea and will respond appropriately to any and all North_Korean provocationsEarthquake agencies in China Japan and the United_States all recorded unusual seismic activity in the northeastern corner of North_Korea at 10am local time WednesdayThe US Geological Survey recorded a shallow 51-magnitude quake about 20 miles from the facility at Punggye-ri where North_Korea has carried_out its three previous nuclear_tests Many analysts have been surprised that such a long period has passed without another test because it is by testing that North_Korea can advance its programI think they have a technological path in mind said Jeffrey_Lewis a nuclear expert_at the Middlebury_Institute of International_Studies in Monterey CalifIn December Lewis noted that satellite pictures showed North_Korea appeared to be at its nuclear_test site warning that the Pyongyang regime might be preparing to conduct a fourth atomic test There is a lot of tunneling at the test_site which could mean they have a bunch of tests planned he saidAlthough analysts were still awaiting more data Lewis said that Wednesdays explosion looked very similar to past tests and was not enormous suggesting it was not a hydrogen bombIn Seoul and Tokyo the governments called emergency national_security meetings to discuss the possibility of a nuclear testThis nuclear_test by North_Korea is a major threat to our countrys security and I absolutely cannot accept it Japanese_Prime Minister_Shinzo Abe told_reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday Also it is clearly a violation of United_Nations Security_Council resolutions so we will take strong measure including steps within the UN_Security CouncilJoel Wit a former US diplomat who runs the 38 North website dedicated to North_Korea said that the purpose of the test remained unclearWhat is clear is that North_Korea is moving forward with its nuclear_weapons program and that the United_States China and the international_community need to come up with more effective ways to deal with this growing threat he said Yoonjung_Seo in Seoul and Yuki Oda in Tokyo contributed to this reportDC Council members said they were gravely worried about patients safety at the Districts only public hospital in a tense hearing Monday as the executives who run the troubled facility pledged to improveThe DC Council health committee hearing focused on the performance of Veritas of Washington a firm led by campaign donors to Mayor Muriel E Bowser (D) which has managed United Medical Center for a fee of $300000 per month since 2016 The council must decide in the coming weeks whether to renew the contractThe hearing came on the same day The Washington_Post published an account of the death of Warren Webb a 47-year-old UMC nursing home resident with AIDS who died Aug 25 of a heart attack after being left on the floor for at_least 20 minutes by his caregivers The_Post obtained of Webb crying out repeatedly for help in the run-up to his death Veritas and UMC executives defended their handling of the incident in their testimony saying they had undertaken an exhaustive review of the case and reported it to the appropriate regulatory authorities They declined to say what specific steps they had taken to discipline the nurses involved citing employee confidentialityRegulators with the DC Health Department said last_week that the hospital did_not report details of the case that would have triggered an outside investigation and the agency began investigating Webbs death based on The Posts reportingThree eyewitnesses to the incident also told The_Post that no hospital officials had interviewed them about what happenedI am gravely concerned about the quality of care at UMC said council member Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) pointing to the details of Webbs death What is described is shocking for a health-care facility and simply unacceptableCouncil member Vincent Gray (D-Ward 7) the health committees chairman said he was worried that UMCs management was not being held accountable because the hospital serves a poor and heavily Medicaid-reliant group of patients in Southeast Washington Veritass performance at UMC would never be tolerated anywhere else in the city not for six months not for a single second Gray saidThe hospital has come under increasing scrutiny since early August when city health regulators abruptly closed its obstetrics ward without explaining whyThe Post later reported that the closure came because of that included a failure to take measures to prevent the transmission of HIV to a newborn and inadequate screening and treatment for a pregnant woman with a history of potentially fatal blood-pressure problemsVeritas is owned by Chrystie Boucre wife of Corbett Price whom Bowser appointed in 2015 to the board of the Metro transportation system Price his relatives and his companies made more_than $35000 in political donations to Bowser in 2014 campaign-finance records_show At Mondays hearing Veritas employee and interim hospital chief_executive David Boucre a cousin of Chrystie Boucre said Veritas is still struggling with legacy problems it inherited when it took over the hospital but is on the way to improving its financial stability and quality of careDavid Boucre said Veritas is coming up with plans to reopen the obstetrics ward which would ultimately have to be approved by the hospital board He also pointed to a prospective contract for a doctors group associated with George Washington University to take over UMCs emergency roomHowever he cautioned that both initiatives might require a taxpayer subsidy a move that the mayor has said she wants to avoidDavid Boucre recently took over the helm of UMC after that the prior chief_executive Luis Hernandez would be moved to a new position at the hospitalA search for a permanent replacement for Hernandez is underway But council members repeatedly questioned Boucre about whether he is qualified to run UMC in the meantimeBoucre who told The_Post in August that his professional background is in information technology and outsourcing said he had not explicitly run a hospital before but had managed many large and complex organizationsHe cited his work for companies including Lockheed Martin and Inovalon a health-care data analytics company All the efforts that I have done throughout my career have been industry-agnostic he saidAfter a year of frosty diplomacy and economic pressure South_Korea and China announced Tuesday that they would put aside their differences out of a joint desire to denuclearize the Korean PeninsulaSouth Koreas Foreign_Ministry said the two_countries will resume normal relations The two sides attach great importance to the Korea-China relationship a statement from the ministry saidIn its own coordinated statementChinas Foreign_Ministry said the two nations would work to put their relationship back on a normal trackas soon as possibleChina and South_Korea have historically deep ties and over the past few decades had enjoyed a close relationship However that relationship was deeply damaged last July when Seoul agreed to install the US-owned Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defense_(THAAD) missile_defense platform on its landThough both Seoul and Washington argued the THAAD system had only defensive capabilities Beijing was concerned about US encirclement as well as the systems sophisticated radar capabilitiesChinese President_Xi Jinping was also angered that former South_Korean president Park_Geun-hye had sided with American interests over China said Yun Suna senior associate with the East_Asia Program at the Stimson CenterXi had tried to sway South_Koreas alignment choice and when Park rejected Chinas demand not to deploy THAAD it made Xis great diplomacy on South_Korea a failure and an embarrassment Sun said in an email this weekendWhen the missile system was deployed earlier_this year Chinas Foreign_Ministry spokesman_Geng Shuang warned that Beijing would resolutely take necessary measures to defend our security interestsSouth Koreas Foreign_Ministry acknowledged that the THAAD dispute had not been fully resolvedThe two sides agreed to engage in communication on THAAD-related issues about which the Chinese side is concerned through communication between their military authorities it said in a statementFor its part China confirmed Tuesday that its position on THAAD had not changedAnd on Sunday South_Koreas military chief met with his American and Japanese counterparts as part of a growing three-way dialogueChina is South_Koreas largest trading partner and it used this economic clout to punish Korean businesses when the antimissile_system was deployed Trips by Chinese tour groups to South_Korea were suspended with the number of Chinese visitors dropping 60percent in the first nine months of the year compared with 2016 according to figures released by the Bank of KoreaKorean-owned businesses also suffered boycotts and bans in China The situation was especially difficult for the Lotte conglomerate which had allowed its land to be used for the installation of the THAAD system Last month it announced it would be selling off its supermarkets in China after most were shut_down for fire code violations and other alleged infractionsPresident Moon Jae-ins new South_Korean government had recently made a number of moves to ease Chinas anxiety over THAAD withForeign Minister Kang Kyung-wha announcing last_week that South_Korea would not seek any more deployments of the system The moves had been received warmly in Chinas state-run press with the nationalist saying that theproactive stance of Moons government wasa new gesture that is welcomedChoi Kang vice_president of the Seoul think_tank Asan Institute for Policy Studies said that South_Korea had not offered any real concessions on the issueSince South_Korea has maintained a very firm position on THAAD the Chinese side decided to move instead Kang saidInstead North_Korea and other factors may have led to the agreement between the two nations which came after the Chinese Party Congress that saw Xi consolidate his power over the country and exactly a week before President Trump arrives in South_Korea as part of a 12-day Asia tripChina is keen to restart relations with South_Korea under Moon said Sun as he has signaled that he is seeking an independent policy and is open to talks with North_Korea a long-standing ally of BeijingWhen the relationship with President Park was beyond repair for China Moon gives China new hope Sun wrote However Kang said that the two sides still had different outlooks on the region that could lead to more disputes China and South_Korea felt the necessity to manage their bilateral relations for different reasons not for common objectives and concerns Kang saidThe conflict is not over yetNorth Koreas provocations have prompted other shifts in the Pacific as well In one example the senior military officials from the United_States South_Korea and Japan are incrementally increasing collective ballistic_missile defense despite strained relations between South_Korea and Japan that date back to Japans invasion of the Korean_Peninsula during World_War IIOn Sunday Marine Gen Joseph F Dunford Jr the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff met with his South_Korean counterpart Gen Jeong Kyeong-doo and their Japanese equivalent Adm Katsutoshi Kawano at the sun-drenched headquarters of US Pacific Command in HawaiiThe Japanese and South_Korean defense chiefs have narrowly increased military dialogue with each other as it relates to North_Korea meeting five times since July 2014 in three-party talks with Dunford and his predecessor Army Gen Martin E Dempsey On Sunday the agreed to hold quarterly missile_defense exercises in 2018 Dunford saidDunford said that the discussions between South_Korea and Japan are important for a couple of reasons Number one from a deterrence perspective its important that Kim_Jong Un and [North Korea] see that they are facing a collective response from the international_community and in particular those nations most affected Dunford said And number two if we do have to respond Japan is a critical ally that the United_States is going to need to meet its alliance commitments We have over 50000 forces in Japan It is a platform from which we would project power in any South_Korean response Simon Denyer in Beijing and Dan Lamothe in Washington contributed to this reportSouth Korean President Park_Geun-hye was removed from office Friday as the countrys Constitutional_Court unanimously upheld a parliamentary vote to impeach her for her role in a corruption and influence-peddling scandalElections for a new president must now be held within 60 days and polls point to a change in political direction for South_Korea Progressive candidate Moon Jae-in holds a strong lead over the conservatives who were once loyal to ParkThe court dismisses President Park_Geun-hye from her position said Lee Jung-mi the acting chief justice delivering the highly anticipated verdict Friday There is no other choice but to decide this verdictPark did_not make any comment on the decision and remained in the presidential Blue_House on Friday afternoonHwang Kyo-ahn the caretaker prime_minister who is now acting president declared South_Korea to be in an emergency situation saying he would try to ensure stability and assuage internationalconcernsThe impeachmentmarks a historic moment in a country that adopted democracy only 30_years ago In sharp contrast with South_Koreas history of military coups peaceful protests this time led to the removal of an elected leader But supporters of Park wasted no time in venting their anger Friday morning clashing with riot police and breaching cordons around the courtTwo people were reported to have died during the protestsThe case has rocked South_Korean society because of the sheer extent of the alleged corruption Not only is the presidential Blue_House implicated but also the chiefs of leading companies such as Samsung a high-profile prosecutor and the head of the national pension fund the worlds third-largestThe case comes at a time of high tensions in the region with North_Korea firing missiles and issuing threats and an angry China retaliating against South_Korea for hostingan American antimissile_battery which Beijing views as an effort to curtail ChinaAll eight justices on the Constitutional_Court voted to uphold the impeachment motion against Park which passed by an in December The justices said the president had continuously violated the law and the constitutionThe court concluded that the president had helped her friend Choi_Soon-sil extract bribes from South_Korean conglomerates The negative impact of the presidents legal violations is serious andthe benefits to defending the constitution by dismissing her from office are overwhelmingly large the acting chief justice said in reading out the courts ruling Analysts had expected the impeachment decisionIt was such an obvious case that there was no room for the court to rule other than impeaching the president said Kim Seon-taek a professor of constitutional law at Korea UniversityThrough the Choi-gate investigation we found serious violations of laws and evidence of meddling with law and order of the nation by both Choi_Soon-sil and Park_Geun-hye Kim saidBut Parks lawyers vowed to fight onI cannot accept todays conclusion attorney Suh Suk-koo told_reporters outside the court saying they would consider appealing The biased Korean media coupled with left-leaning and North_Korean sympathizing labor unions have led anti-Park protests to the streets of South KoreaParks supporters mainly older conservative Koreans began protesting outside the court immediately after the decision pushing through riot police and climbing over barricades around the court Several people were seen unconscious on the ground The political scandal extraordinary even by the standards of South Koreastumultuous democracy revolves around Park and her who held no official position but turned out to wield huge influence over the president much more_than her official advisers and ministersChoi is accused of extracting bribes from big business Samsung alone is accused of planning to give her $37 million in return for using her relationship with the president to ensure favorable treatment for the companiesSpecial prosecutors tasked with investigating the case known here as Choi-gate said in a 101-page report released this week that they had found evidence that the president colluded with Choi Park refused to be questioned by the special prosecutorsProsecutors have recommended 13 charges_against Park including abuse ofpower coercion ofdonations and the sharing of state secrets Park had immunity from prosecution while she was in office but has lost that now that she has been removed from the presidencyThe release of the prosecutors report coincided with the conclusion of the Constitutional Courts 10-week-long deliberation on the impeachment case Park declined to appear before the court although she issued statements through her lawyers in which she had steadfastly denied wrongdoingThe case couldnt have been any clearer said Chung Tae-ho of Kyung Hee University With this verdict the Constitutional_Court has sent an unequivocal warning to the people in power not to take advantage of their positions and seek personal gains Park was suspended from office in December after weeks of enormous protests with hundreds of thousands of people packing the streets of Seoul every Saturdaycalling on her to resign or be impeachedThe outrage against her was triggered by revelations that thepresident who seldom consulted with her ministers and official advisers had been taking secret counsel on everything from North_Korea policy to her wardrobe choices from a friend who held no official positionMaking matters worse it turned out that Choithe daughter of a shaman cult leaderhad appeared to take advantage of her relationship with the president to enrich herself and win favors for her familyShe is accused of receiving about $70 million in bribes from big business groups Park adamantly denied all the allegationsSamsungs de facto head Lee Jae-yong went on trial Thursday on charges including bribery embezzlement and perjury and Choi has been on trial for monthsBoth strongly deny wrongdoing although at a parliamentary hearing in December Lee admitted that Samsung had given a $900000 horse to Chois daughter an Olympic equestrian hopefulNow that Park has been ousted permanently new elections must be held within 60 daysThe conservative faction is in disarray with the ruling party splitting into those who supported the president and those wanting to distance themselves from herThe latest polls put Moon a progressive from the Democratic_Party who ran against Park in the last presidential_election in the lead although he is facing a surpriseMoon has taken a much more conciliatory approach toward North_Korea than the conservative governments that have held power since 2008 and his election would likely see the resumption

into an economic powerhouse by supporting conglomerates such as Samsung and HyundaiPark Geun-hye has long been considered a kind of princess figure in South_Korea and one with a traumatic past While she was in college her mother was killed by a bullet meant for her father shot by a North_Korean sympathizer Even today Park wears an old-fashioned hairstyle reminiscent of her mothersShe effectively became South_Koreas first lady at 22 and during this time became close to Choi Tae-min the founder of a religious cult that incorporated elements of Christianity and Buddhism He would deliver messages to Park from her dead mother according to local reports A US Embassy cable noted that the local media described Choi as a Korean RasputinPark also became close to Chois daughter Choi_Soon-sil and

contributed to this reportNorth Koreas pursuit of a nuclear_weapons program will only hasten its collapse South_Korean President Park_Geun-hye said Tuesday forgoing her usual caution to warn in uncharacteristically blunt terms that her government will do all it can to punish Pyongyang for Talk of the Norths collapse is normally a no-go topic here because the prospect not only alarms South Koreans but also enrages Kim_Jong Uns irascible regime But following the Norths nuclear and missile_tests this year Park is taking a markedly more confrontational approachDear people of South_Korea its obvious now that our previous methods and goodwill cannot break Pyongyangs nuclear will she said in a special televised address to the National Assembly I believe we should not provide them with unconditional support anymore or succumb to their provocations We now need to find a fundamental solution to effectively change North_Korea and it is our time to be brave Her tough words come at a time when South_Korea Japan and the United_States are in unusual accord on how to deal with North_Korea Her address also coincides with a buildup in US military muscle on the Korean_Peninsula Four US F-22 stealth fighter jets are set to arrive in the South on Wednesday while the USS John C Stennis aircraft carrier is due later in the month ahead of joint military exercisesPark has pursued what she calls a trustpolitik approach to North_Korea trying to build trust without weakening deterrence But last_week she signaled a significant shift when she ordered the shutdown of the inter-Korean industrial zone at Kaesong on the northern side of the demilitarized zone that separates the two_countries where about 54000 North_Koreans worked in 124 South Korean-owned factories had long been kept separate from politics it was not shuttered even after a North_Korean attack on a South_Korean naval corvette in 2010 that killed 46 South_Korean sailorsBut Park citing estimates that the Souths government and private enterprises have contributed $3billion to the Norths government over the past 20 years including through the Kaesong project has pulled the plugThe shutdown was just the start she said Tuesday From now on the government will start taking stronger and more effective measures to push North_Korea to make changes by creating an environment in which the North will realize that nuclear development is not a way to ensure its survival but a way to ensure the quick collapse of the regime she saidParks comments including the mention of the Norths collapse took many analysts by surpriseShe has announced a real change in her policy said Choi Kang vice_president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies a Seoul think_tank She didnt say regime change but it seems that she has something like that in mindThere are few economic avenues left for the South to punish the North The Kumgang tourist area where South Koreans could visit a North_Korean mountain range in a project that generated foreign currency for the Kim regime was shut_down years_ago after a South_Korean woman was shot by a North_Korean guard put in place after the 2010 naval attack also curbed economic cooperation and tradeBut there is plenty that South_Korea could do militarily Choi said including beefing up the capabilities of its armed forces continuing to blare anti-Kim messages across the DMZ and perhaps even cutting off humanitarian aidThe Souths recent actions especially the loudspeaker messages have infuriated the North In a statement last_week after the Kaesong shutdown the Norths official Korean_Central News_Agency labeled Park a confrontational wicked woman operating at the groin of her American bossPyongyang also has been sending anti-South leaflets over the DMZ with balloons Some that landed north of Seoul on Tuesday according to local media featured a caricature of Park and warned of divine vengeance for what it said were her failures including the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking in which hundreds died the high suicide rate and a MERS outbreak The leaflet featured death portraits of Parks mother who was shot by a North_Korean agent and her father former president

repeatedly called Trump a liar without directly saying so using clips of Trump himself saying liar and world-class liar and talking in exasperated tones about Trumps bogus birtherism claimsin a Friday newsconferenceTrump said Friday in that he ended the birther controversy in 2011 by getting President_Obama to release his birth certificate and that Hillary_Clinton and her campaign actually first raised the questions about whether Obama was born in the United_States Neither is correctAfter playing video of Trump saying he finished the birther controversy Colbert went offNo you didnt No you didnt Colbertsaid And I know you didnt because I was alive and on TVHe added But you know what Maybe memory is a tricky thing Maybe I remember it one way and Donald Trump is a liarColbert then played a montage of Trump raising questions about Obamas birth certificate even after 2011 While its airing he carves a wooden statuette of Rodins The Thinker Afterward he talked to the statueWhat are you thinking about Colbert asked Im thinking hes a liar Colbert-as-the-statuette respondedColbert concluded You dont get to flog this issue for five_years and then act like youre correcting everybody else Were not crazy We were there We all saw you do it Even the people who support you saw you do it Its why they support youLate-night comics have been going after Donald Trump since he was merely billionaire Donald Trump and not yet President Trump But a parody on Stephen Colberts Late_Show captured the weirdness of Trumps tumultuous first month in office by invoking the name of a historic movie villain Keyser SzeIt happened Wednesday night when Colbert sporting a fake widows peak inserted himself into the final scene of The Usual SuspectsThe 1995 movies antagonist is a shadowy crime kingpin who subtly pulls the strings of the criminal underworld Every criminal knows Keyser Sze and fears him even though no one has met him and he may not technically existThe movie rocketed Kevin_Spacey to an Academy Award and in the last two_decades Keyser Sze has taken on a pop culture life of his own a personification of the powerful (and possibly entirely made-up) ghosts that control

Keyser Szes true identity is revealedAs Colberts parody clip starts an investigator demands informationYes I do know something Colbert responds And Im telling you everything Youre just not listening Ive been telling you for like a year Theres something weird going on between Trump and the Russians The answers he says are on the crowded bulletin boardAs the investigator turns his head the scene shifts to a revelatory montage voiced by Donald Trump sound bitesIf Putin likes Donald Trump I consider that an asset not a liability Trump says in the voice-overI think Putins been a very strong

JoeIn Colberts parody just like in the movie all the clues click in the end Overwhelmed by the revelation the investigator drops his mug spilling coffeeOn the bottom of the shattered pieces Trump/Putin 2016Stephen Colbert dropped the L word (lie) and the F word (you know) on the Trump White_House on Monday_night It was the late-night comedians latest blast of politically charged commentary primarily directed at the 45th president And it was the kind of performance that just a short time ago seemed to risk alienating large numbers of potential viewers but now appears to be making the Late_Show host a very big drawColbert lampooned White_House senior policy_adviser Stephen Miller who on his tour of the Sunday political talk shows assertedthat the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questionedWill not be questioned Let_me test that theory Colbert said What the f--- are you talking aboutColbert then challenged Miller who said he is prepared to go on any show anytime anywhere to appear on Tuesdays Late ShowListen if you dont show up Im_going to call you a liar Colbert said And if you do show up Im_going to call you a liar to your faceMiller did_not showWith forceful remarks like this Colbert on late-night king Jimmy Fallon who is far less inclined to take on the president in a harsh mannerConventional wisdom is that Fallons approach works best on a major broadcast network When the of late-night viewers in the fall of 2015 shortly_after Colberts debut on CBS it found that Fallon appealed to people across the political spectrum The Tonight Show hosts audience was 36 percent Democrat 31 percent Republican and 27 percent independentColberts audience skewed sharply to the left 47 percent Democrat 17 percent Republican and 31 percent independentA liberal slanthelped make Colbert a star on Comedy Central but CBS executives made it clear that they expected Mr Colbert to broaden his appeal when he moved to the medium of late night on a network the at the time of his hiringColbert however was among Trumps during the campaign and never really moderated his politics Ratings throughout his first year on the Late_Show were much to the delight of conservative publications such as the Weekly Standard which Colberts early struggles sweet schadenfreudeAbsent another survey of late-night audiences it is unclear what exactly has reversed Colberts fortunes Are liberal viewers tuning in in greater numbers Or is Colbert bringing in conservatives who were uncomfortable with Trump during the campaign and who feel unnerved by his fledgling administrationIt is worth noting that Colberts skewering of Miller on Monday_night had little to do with liberal or conservative policy ideas it was about a claim to unchecked power which could alarm anybodyWell see whether Colbert can sustain his recent success But if he was waiting for ratings to catch up to his vision for the Late_Show his patience is being rewarded for nowThe first seven weeks of Donald Trumps presidency have injectedseveral new phrases into the American lexiconTheres Kellyanne Conways interpretation of the easily disproved things

news agencies reported that the administration askedsenior members of the intelligence_community to counter stories about Trump associates ties to Russia the calls were made after FBI officials refused to do thatDean isnt the only Trump critic who has made this comparisonEvery time you think the Trump Administration could be semi-normal theres something like this and it feels like Nixon 73 all over again Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) A reminder for Trump Nixon also tried to stop an FBI investigation He found out no president is above the law Jim McGovern (@RepMcGovern) Four decades ago as the Watergate scandal swirled Dean said Nixons White_House behaved in a similar fashion trying to use the CIA to cut_off the FBI investigationAsdetails of Nixons interactions with intelligence officials seeped out Dean said the president tried to cover up what_happened which caused even more damageWhat it did is it caught Richard Nixon in a lie because he had denied he had known anything about any cover up until I told him much later when I started having direct dealings with him Dean said And it was the lie that caught him more_than that particular incidentDean also said Trumps sour opinion of the media rivalsNixonsThey just screw it up They screw it all up In approach execution They screw it up Richard M Nixon (@dick_nixon) There is one key difference Nixon mostly kept his views private Trumps disdain is very public In a sprawling news_conference last_week for example Trump bashed the mediaAs The Posts on Thursdays news_conference Trump repeatedly lambasted the fake_news media which at one point he upgraded (or downgraded) to the very fake_news media while promoting some dubious claims and they reported The media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges we made and theyre not happy about it for whatever reason Trump said at Thursdays news conferenceDean said Nixon made those kind of comments that we only know about because he had his secret taping system running and seemed to forget it was on just constantly when he was in the officeIt would automatically go on And hed make those kind of attacks against the media calling the media the enemy saying that he was going to wiretap them and surveil them to find out who was leakingIn his interview Dean delves into a bigger question If Trumphas so many parallels with Nixon will his presidency end in similar fashionThe House and Senate are controlled by the Republicans theyre not going to impeach their president he said As long as he gives them what they want and signs into legislation or signs into law a lot of the things that theyve had in their dreams for many years theyre not going to give him any problem Impeachment is not a legal process Its a quasi-legal process but its primarily a political process And were not there yetAs a service to readers bound to be confused by an increasinglycomplex story heres a brief guide to the latest developments in the tangled allegations involving Russia President Trump and Hillary_Clinton The dossier is concerning President Trump and Russia written by Christopher_Steele a former_British intelligence_officer between June 20 and Dec 13 2016 Steele produced his memos under a contract with Fusion_GPS The memos are based on interviews Steele had with unidentified Russian sources (identified for instance as Kremlin insider) some of whom he paid for information Raw intelligence is essentially high-grade gossip without the expectation it would be made public unless it is further verifiedThe memos among other things allege the Russian_government had been seeking to split the Western alliance by cultivating and supporting Trump and also gathering compromising_information kompromat on him in an effort to blackmail him The memos among other allegations claim the Russian_government fed the Trump campaign valuable intelligence on Clinton The dossier mirrors a separate conclusion by US intelligence_agencies that the Russian_government intervened in the US election in an effort to bolster Trump and harm Clinton such as through hacking the Democratic_National Committee and distributing materials to WikiLeaks to publish at key moments As the statedWe assess Russian President_Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed_at the US presidential_election Russias goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process denigrate Secretary Clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump We have high confidence in these judgmentsRussian President_Vladimir Putin intensely disliked Clinton because he was convinced that when she was secretary of state she had promoted anti-Putin pro-democracy efforts in his country The FBI considered the information gathered by Steele to be of sufficient importance that it although it later dropped the idea The DNC and Clinton campaign as the Democratic donors who paid Fusion_GPS for Steeles research (Technically Perkins_Coie the law_firm of Marc Elias an attorney representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC funded the research)Separately a Republican donor who had earlier hired Fusion_GPS for information on Trump to be the Washington Free_Beacon a conservative website But that earlier effort is unrelated to the Democratic-funded research that yielded the dossier as Steele was hired by Fusion_GPS after work for the Free_Beacon had endedWe should note that in another assignment Fusion had been hired by a US law_firm in early 2014 to assist on the defense against a civil action filed by the US government alleging fraud by Prevezon Holdings Prevezon is owned by Denis Katsyv the son of a senior Russian_government officialWhy is that relevant Natalia Veselnitskaya who was also working for the law_firm on the Prevezon case met with Trump campaign officials at the Trump_Tower in June_2016 including Donald Trump Jr campaign_manager Paul_Manafort and Jared_Kushner the husband of Ivanka Trump Donald Trump Jr agreed to meet with Veselnitskaya after an intermediary promised dirt on Clinton She arrived with a memo containing by Yuri Chaika Russias prosecutor general who is known as a master of kompromat The Trump White_House has between the dossier andClinton to claim that this shows that rather_than Trump colluding with Russia Clinton colluded with Russia (The theory appears to be that because Steele was getting information from Russian officials in part with funds provided by the Clinton campaign the Russians were helping Clinton)But that ignores the fact that DNC emails as well as the email account of the Clinton campaign_chairman were hacked and then published by WikiLeaks as part of the pro-Trump Russian operation identified byUS intelligence_agencies (Wikileaks denies it received the material from Russia) Indeed the Wall_Street Journal that a prominent Trump donor and the chief_executive of a data-analytics firm working for Trumps presidential campaign in August 2016 discussed how to better organize the Clinton-related emails being released by Wikileaks in order to leverage their impactSteele started producing his memos in June_2016 about the same_time that intelligence_agencies began investigating possible ties between Russia and people close to Trump The connection between Steeles research and official government investigations is murky but for some Republicans it raises questions about whether the official probe begun in the Obama_administration was influenced by information gathered by someone being paid by DemocratsCNN for instance that the FBI used information in the Steele memos to obtain approval from the secret court that oversees the Foreign_Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to monitor the communications of Carter_Page who Trump had said was a key adviser on national_security issues Presumably the FBI had verified the information before it could cite it in court Steele had quoted an ethnic Russian close associate of Trump as saying Page was an intermediary in a well-developed conspiracy of co-operation between the Trump campaign and the Russian leadership Page has adamantly denied any wrongdoingSteele during the campaign at Fusions direction also briefed reporters from some US news_organizations including The Washington_Post on his findings Only one publication Mother Jones based on the briefing before the election In 2010 Rosatom the Russian nuclear energy agency acquired a controlling stake in Uranium_One a Canadian-based company that had mining licenses at the time for about 20_percent of US uranium_extraction capacity (Note and the United_States as a whole extracts relatively little uranium) The agreement was approved by the Obama_administration when Clinton was secretary of stateFrank Giustra a Canadian mining financier and a major contributor to the Clinton_Foundation had sold a company UrAsia to Uranium_One in 2007 Individuals related to Uranium_One and UrAsia including Giustra donated to the Clinton_Foundation totaling about $145 million though most of the donations took_place before and during her 2008 presidential run Meanwhile in 2010 Bill_Clinton received $500000 from a Russian bank to give a speech at a conference in MoscowTrump during the campaign tossed all of these separate facts together to falsely claim that Clinton gave 20_percent of our uranium gave Russia for a big payment But numerous fact_checks have for this claim The original suggestion of wrongdoing was first raised in a book underwritten by an organization headed by Stephen_K Bannon a key adviser to Trump Whenever news about the Russia investigation heats up the Trump White_House cites the uranium_deal in an effort to muddy the waters and suggest that Russia had gained something from Clinton in exchange for money Trump himself has claimed the case is Watergate modern ageBut there is no_evidence Clinton even was informed about this deal The Treasury Department was the key agency that headed the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United_States which approved the investment Clinton did_not participate in the CFIUS decision The deal was also approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Ultimately only the president could have blocked or suspended the arrangementMoreover no uranium produced at Uranium_Ones US mines may be exported except for some uranium yellowcake which is extracted and processed in Canada before being returned to the United_States for use in nuclear power plants[The Hill newspaperon Nov 2 that some of the uranium from Uranium_One facilities was exported to Europe We had noted before that the uranium could not be exported with the exception of yellowcake being shipped to Canada for conversion with the expectation it would be returned to the United_States But once Uranium_Ones material arrived in Canada it apparently was mixed with yellowcake from other suppliers and then Canada received permission from the Energy Department to send converted USuraniumto Europe for enrichment Uranium_One says it sold about 25 percent of its US-extracted yellowcake via book transfer to customers overseaswhich does_not necessarily mean the material moved because ownership in commodity markets is not the same as possession US officials say it is unknown whether any uranium extracted by Uranium_One was transferred overseas] The Hill newspaper on Oct 22 the FBI had gathered evidence at the time of the sale that a Russian Rosatom official had conducted a massive bribery scheme compromising an American trucking company that shipped uranium for Russia The official eventually but Republicans have said the case about the Rosatom investment in Uranium_One and possibly blocked the deal But there is no_evidence that US officials weighing the transaction knew about the FBI investigationThe reporting prompted House Republicans to announce they would launch an investigation With the Justice_Department gave a former FBI informant in the case approval to testify before Congress The informants lawyer claimed he would discuss his work uncovering the Russian nuclear bribery case and the efforts he witnessed by Moscow to gain influence with [former president Bill_Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton] in hopes of winning favorable uranium decisions from the Obama_administration Any suggestion that Russian money was directed to influence Clintons decisions would be explosive But the fatal flaw in this allegation is Hillary_Clinton by all accounts did_not participate in any discussions regarding the Uranium_One sale which as we noted does_not actually result in the removal of uranium from the United States()Hillary Clintons involvement with a Russian uranium_deal has come under_scrutiny since author and Breitbart_News senior editor-at-large Peter Schweizer dedicated a chapter to the topic in his 2015 book Clinton Cash The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary RichThe Trump campaign has been attacking Clinton over the uranium_deal lately perhaps as a way to distract attention from criticism of Trumps interest in fostering a closer relationship with Russia Clinton Cash was made into a graphic novel and a documentary and on Oct 20 makers of the graphic novel released an about the uranium_deal FactCheckorg and PolitiFact have covered the facts and we wrote about the deal briefly in a But with the renewed attention this month we decided to take a deeper look at Clintons role in this dealThe Trump campaign pointed to an about this deal based on a preview of Clinton Cash The Times said it scrutinized his [Schweizers] information and built upon it with its own reportingThe story starts with Frank Giustra a Canadian mining financier and donor to the Clinton_Foundation Giustras company UrAsia and Uranium_One a uranium mining company headquartered in TorontoIn 2007 Giustra sold UrAsia to Uranium_One which was based in South Africa and chaired by his friend Ian Telfer Giustra said he in the deal in fall 2007 shortly_after the merger with Uranium_One in the midst of Clintons 2008 presidential campaign and before Clinton realizedBarack Obama would win the nomination and she would become his secretary of stateIn 2009 Russias nuclear energy agency Rosatom began buying shares in Uranium_One as a part of a larger move to acquire mines around the world Rosatom first bought a 17 percent share of Uranium_One which has holdings in the United_States In 2010 the Russians sought to increase their share to 51 percent The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United_States (CFIUS) and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the deal In 2013 Russia assumed 100 percent ownershipThe deal gave Russia control of about 20_percent of US uranium_extraction capacity according to a about the deal In other words Russia has rights to the uranium extracted at those sites which represents 20_percent of the US uranium production capacityThe State_Department was one of nine agencies comprising CFIUS which vets potential national_security impacts of transactions where a foreign government gains control of a US company It was established by Congress in 2007 after the controversy over the planned purchase of seaports by a company in United Arab Emirates The other agencies were the departments of Treasury Defense Justice Commerce Energy and Homeland_Security andtwo White_House agencies (Office of the US Trade Representative and Office of Science and Technology Policy)The CFIUS can approve a deal but can suspend or stop a transaction If the committee cant come to a consensus a member can recommend a suspension or prohibition of the deal and the president makes the callDue to confidentiality laws there are few details made public about the deal or about Clintons role in it The Clinton campaign Clinton herself was not involved in the State Departments review and did_not direct the department to take any position on the sale of Uranium_One Matters of the CFIUS did_not rise to the level of the secretary the campaign saidJose Fernandez then-assistant secretary of state for economic energy and business affairs sat on the committee Fernandez told the Times Mrs Clinton never intervened with me on any CFIUS matter Fernandez did_not respond to our requests for commentHillarys opposition [to the Uranium_One deal] would have been enough under CFIUS rules to have the decision on the transaction kicked up to the president That never happened Schweizer wrote in Clinton CashAt the time the sale was underway the Obama_administration was its relations with Russia with Clinton leading the effort as secretary of state But there is no_evidence approval of the sale was connected to the reset policy The national_security concern that the United_States faced when CFIUS considered the deal concerned American dependence on foreign uranium sources the Times reportedYet the Uranium_One deal was not on the radar ofMichael McFaul even though he was aware of many CFIUS cases in his role as the National Security Councils senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs from 2009 to 2012 (and as a prime architect of the administrations reset policy) McFaul now senior fellow at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institution said Fernandez could not dictate the outcome of any decision single-handedly as he was one of nine membersKnowing how the CFIUS process works and how the bureaucracy at the State_Department works I cannot imagine that such an issue would be reviewed by the secretary of state There is a hierarchy in place precisely to protect the secretarys time for only the most important of issues and meetings McFaul saidI was not personally involved because that wasnt something the secretary of state did Clinton told in June 2015Some Republican lawmakers in 2010 did raise concerns about the deal but they to then-Treasury Secretary Timothy F Geithner () Final approval which noted that the mines would remain under the control of US subsidiaries Neither Uranium_One nor ARMZ [the Russian firm] holds an NRC export license so no uranium produced at either facility may be exported the NRC said (Some uranium yellowcake is extracted processed in Canada and returned to the United States)We asked the Trump campaign for evidence that Clinton or the State_Department had more of a role in the deal than any of the eight other member agencies of CFIUS and did_not receive a responseDid the Clintons get paid for the Russian dealThe Trump campaign pointed todonations to the Clinton_Foundation as reported by the Times Giustra became friends with Bill_Clinton in 2005 over their charity work The Washington_Post took an at their ties and described their friendship as one that has helped propel the Clinton_Foundation into a global giant and established Giustras reputation as an international philanthropist while helping him build connections in countries where his business was expandingGiustra eventually became one of the largest individual donors to the Clinton_Foundation His relationship with the Clintons came under_scrutiny over donors to the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada) which raises money for the similarly named Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership one of the Clinton Foundations initiatives (For more on this read more about it and )Individuals related to Uranium_One and UrAsia including Giustra and Telfer donated to the Clinton_Foundation totaling about $145 million The Times reported that Telfer also donated to the Clinton_Foundation using his family charity based in Canada These were donations made to the Clinton_Foundation not directly to the ClintonsAs the majority of these donations were made before and during Clintons 2008 presidential run So Trumps claim that Hillary_Clinton gave [uranium to] Russia for a big payment is not accurate If she had actually become president she would have had more power over the deal than as the head of one agency among nine represented on CFIUSThe Trump campaign also noted that Bill_Clinton received speaking fees while the Uranium_One deal was underway After the Russians announced that they would acquire stakes in Uranium_One and while the Kremlin was promoting the purchase Bill_Clinton received $500000 in 2010 for a speech in Moscow from a Russian investment bank that had ties to the Kremlin Putin personally thanked Clinton adding that a review of Bill Clintons speeches found no_evidence that speaking fees were paid to the former president in exchange for any action by Mrs ClintonThe Times also did_not report a direct link between Bill_Clinton and the deal The banks analysts talked up Uranium_Ones stock while the deal was under CFIUS consideration and assigned it a buy rating The bank would not comment on the genesis of Mr Clintons speech to an audience that included leading Russian officials or on whether it was connected to the Rosatom deal the Times reportedTrump and his campaign claim that Clinton gave or handed over 20_percent of American uranium rights to the Russians Through the Uranium_One deal the Russian state-owned nuclear energy company does now have control over 20_percent of US uranium_extraction capacity But it cannot export the uraniumIn 2010 the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United_States approved the sale of the majority of the shares to the Russians The State_Department was one of nine agencies on the committee that approved the deal The deal was also separately approved by the Nuclear Regulatory CommissionThere is no_evidence Clinton herself got involved in the deal personally and it is highly questionable that this deal even rose to the level of the secretary of stateTheoretically as Schweizer says Clinton could have intervened But even then it ultimately would have been Obamas decision whether to suspend or block the dealWe wavered between Three and Four Pinocchios Trump so often uses broad-brushed language that pushes him into Four Pinocchio territory and this is yet_another one of those cases He specifically names Hillary_Clinton as the active agent in the Uranium_One deal saying she gave them or handed over uranium to the Russians but that is not the case Then he further claimed the sale went forward in exchange for a big payment Theres no_evidence for that claim eitherTrump could have avoided so many Pinocchios had he been more careful with the language For example Hillary_Clintons State_Department was one of nine agencies that approved the deal Words matter()How would you rate this claim (The check mark means you think the statement is true not that you agree with the rating)We need to verify that you are an actual person This is a non-scientific user poll Results are not statistically valid and cannot be assumed to reflect the views of Washington_Post users as a group or the general populationA couple of days before a host of celebrities spoke out against President Trump at the Oscars Hollywood icon George Clooney was feted at an awards ceremony in Paris There he warned of looming over his homelandWe must not confuse dissent with disloyalty We must not walk in fear of one another We must not be driven by fear into an age of unreason said Clooney He signed off with the famous tagline of late American journalist Edward R Murrow Good night and good luckMurrow of course made his name in opposition to the anti-communist witch hunts launched by Sen Joseph R McCarthy (R-Wis) in the 1950s They see the menace of Beltwayconspiracies and government overreach in Democratic calls for an investigation_into Trumps reported links to Russia In early Januarywas part of a political witch huntRussia talk is FAKE NEWS put out by the Dems and played up by the media in order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) House_Intelligence Committee_Chairman Devin_Nunes a Republican lawmaker from California echoed what seems like the administrations line over the weekendThis is almost like McCarthyism revisited said Nunes to reporters in California to oversee an investigationWere going to go on a witch_hunt against innocent AmericansOn Monday Nunes once more attempted to away from the White_House Theres been major crimes committed said Nunes referring to leaks from the intelligence_community that spurred the Russia allegations What Im concerned about is no one is focusing on major leaks that have occurred here We cant run a government like this A government cant function with massive leaks at the highest levelFirst the cries of McCarthyism fromNunes and other Republicanswere first utteredby figures on the American far-left last_year They lambasted liberal supporters of Hillary_Clinton for instead of properly reckoning with the Now two camps from the opposite sides of the Cold War find themselves in the same cornerSecond the move to quashleakscarries echoes of an earlier era when former president Richard M Nixon and FBI Director J Edgar Hoover both comrades in arms with McCarthy in the face of Nixons own political scandal Things ultimately didnt end well for that Republican presidentThird as Both their political careers were launched by opportunistically channeling the fears of the moment Both men would have happily taken up some other cause had it offered them a path to fame and power wrote Beinart It was their own party and political elites more generally who bred the hostility and fear that they exploited the Trumpadministrationtried to compel CIA officials and Republican politicians to push back on the Russia story in conversations with reporters Efforts by the White_House to spin this story their way before the investigation has run its course and efforts by congressional Republicans to prop up that spin are already looking like ham-handed political interference While Nunes argued there was nothing much to investigate his Democratic colleague on the House_Intelligence Committee Rep Adam Schiff of California that no meaningful investigation has yet taken place He and other lawmakers are demanding hearings thatwould compel agencies like the FBI to clarify what they know and dont_know about Russian_meddling in the elections and contacts with the Trump campAs its probably certain that Moscow wanted to influence the US elections 17 different federal intelligence_agencies after all agreed that Russia was responsible for hacking the Democratic_National Committees emailsRussia or Putin did_not get Trump elected Americans elected Trump said Russian-American journalist Masha Gessen in Russians basically played their sort of classic disruptive role of trying to do something that will both delegitimize democratic mechanisms and throw wrenches into the process They never expected to succeedIn the near future you can expect morewrangling and bluster as the tussle over Russias role continuesFormer Pres George_W Bush We all need answers on extent of contact between Pres Trumps team and Russia ABC News (@ABC) If so at_least one Republican politician may call out Trump for his demagoguery former president George_W BushI consider the media to be indispensable to democracy Bush said in We_need an independent media to hold people like me to account He added That was true in the days of McCarthy and Nixon and yes Bush It remains so nowThe Grand Jury for the District of Columbia chargesAt all times relevant to this Indictment1 Defendants PAUL_J MANAFORT_JR (MANAFORT) and RICHARD_W GATES_III (GATES) served for years as political consultants and lobbyists Between at_least 2006 and 2015 MANAFORT and GATES acted as unregistered agents of the Government of Ukraine the Party of Regions (a Ukrainian political party whose leader Victor Yanukovych was President from 2010 to 2014) Yanukovych and the Opposition Bloc (a successor to the Party of Regions that formed in 2014 when Yanukovych fled to Russia) MANAFORT and GATES generated tens of millions of dollars in income as a result of their Ukraine work In order to hide Ukraine payments from United_States authorities from approximately 2006 through at_least 2016 MANAFORT and GATES laundered the money through scores of United_States and foreign corporations partnerships and bank accounts2 In furtherance of the scheme MANAFORT and GATES funneled millions of dollars in payments into foreign nominee companies and bank_accounts opened by them and their accomplices in nominee names and in various foreign countries including Cyprus Saint Vincent the Grenadines (Grenadines) and the Seychelles MANAFORT and GATES hid the existence of the foreign companies and bank_accounts falsely and repeatedly reporting to their tax preparers and to the United_States that they had no foreign_bank accounts3 In furtherance of the scheme MANAFORT and GATES concealed from the United_States their work as agents of and millions of dollars in payments from Ukraine and its political parties and leaders Because MANAFORT and GATES among other things directed a campaign to lobby United_States officials on behalf of the Government of Ukraine the President of Ukraine and Ukrainian political parties they were required by law to report to the United_States their work and fees MANAFORT and GATES did_not do so Instead when the Departmentof Justice sent inquiries to MANAFORT and GATES in 2016 about their activities MANAFORT and GATES responded with a series of false and misleading statements4 In furtherance of the scheme MANAFORT used his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United_States without paying taxes on that income MANAFORT without reporting the income to his tax preparer or the United_States spent millions of dollars on luxury goods and services for himself and his extended family through payments wired from offshore nominee accounts to United_States vendors MANAFORT also used these offshore_accounts to purchase multi-million dollar properties in the United_States MANAFORT then borrowed millions of dollars in loans using these properties as collateral thereby obtaining cash in the United_States without reporting and paying taxes on the income In order to increase the amount of money he could access in the United_States MANAFORT defrauded the institutions that loaned money on these properties so that they would lend him more money at more favorable rates than he would otherwise be able to obtain5 GATES aided MANAFORT in obtaining money from these offshore_accounts which he was instrumental in opening Like MANAFORT GATES used money from these offshore_accounts to pay for his personal expenses including his mortgage childrens tuition and interior decorating of his Virginia residence6 In total more_than $75000000 flowed through the offshore_accounts MANAFORT laundered more_than $18000000 which was used by him to buy property goods and services in the United_States income that he concealed from the United_States Treasury the Department of Justice and others GATES transferred more_than $3000000 from the offshore_accounts to other accounts that he controlled7 MANAFORT was a United_States citizen He resided in homes in Virginia Florida and Long Island New York8 GATES was a United_States citizen He resided in Virginia9 In 2005 MANAFORT and another partner created Davis Manafort Partners Inc (DMP) to engage principally in political consulting DMP had staff in the United_States Ukraine and Russia In 2011 MANAFORT created DMP International LLC (DMI) to engage in work for foreign clients in particular political consulting lobbying and public relations for the Government of Ukraine the Party of Regions and members of the Party of Regions DMI was a partnership solely owned by MANAFORT and his spouse GATES worked for both DMP and DMI and served_as MANAFORTs right-hand man10 The Party of Regions was a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine Beginning in approximately 2006 it retained MANAFORT through DMP and then DMI to advance its interests in Ukraine including the election of its slate of candidates In 2010 its candidate for President Yanukovych was elected President of Ukraine In 2014 Yanukovych fled Ukraine for Russia in the wake of popular protests of widespread governmental corruption Yanukovych the Party of Regions and the Government of Ukraine were MANAFORT DMP and DMI clients11 The European Centre for a Modern Ukraine (the Centre) was created in or about 2012 in Belgium as a mouthpiece for Yanukovych and the Party of Regions The Centre was used by MANAFORT GATES and others in order to lobby and conduct a public relations campaign in the United_States and Europe on behalf of the existing Ukraine regime The Centre effectively ceased to operate upon the downfall of Yanukovych in 201412 MANAFORT and GATES owned or controlled the following entities which were used in the scheme (the MANAFORT-GATES entities)()13 The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was a bureau in the United_States Department of the Treasury responsible for administering the tax laws of the United_States and collecting taxes owed to the Treasury14 Between in or around 2008 and 2017 both dates being approximate and inclusive in the District of Columbia and elsewhere MANAFORT and GATES devised and intended to devise and executed and attempted to execute a scheme and artifice to defraud and to obtain money and property by means of false and fraudulent pretenses representations and promises from the United_States banks and other financial institutions As part of the scheme MANAFORT and GATES repeatedly provided false information to financial bookkeepers tax accountants and legal counsel among others15 In order to use the money in the offshore nominee accounts of the MANAFORT-GATES entities without paying taxes on it MANAFORT and GATES caused millions of dollars in wire transfers from these accounts to be made for goods services and real_estate They did_not report these transfers as income to DMP DMI or MANAFORT16 From 2008 to 2014 MANAFORT caused the following wires totaling over $12000000 to be sent to the vendors listed below for personal items MANAFORT did_not pay taxes on this income which was used to make the purchases()17 In 2012 MANAFORT caused the following wires to be sent to the entities listed below to purchase the real_estate also listed below MANAFORT did_not report the money used to make these purchases on his 2012 tax return()18 It is illegal to act as an agent of a foreign_principal engaged in certain United_States influence activities without registering the affiliation Specifically a person who engages in lobbying or public relations work in the United_States (hereafter collectively referred to as lobbying) for a foreign_principal such as the Government of Ukraine or the Party of Regions is required to providea detailed written registration statement to the United_States Department of Justice The filing made under oath must disclose the name of the foreign_principal the financial payments to the lobbyist and the measures undertaken for the foreign_principal among other information A person required to make such a filing must further make in all lobbying material a conspicuous statement that the materials are distributed on behalf of the foreign_principal among other things The filing thus permits public awareness and evaluation of the activities of a lobbyist who acts as an agent of a foreign power or foreign political party in the United States19 In furtherance of the scheme from 2006 until 2014 both dates being approximate and inclusive MANAFORT and GATES engaged in a multi-million dollar lobbying campaign in the United_States at the direction of Yanukovych the Party of Regions and the Government of Ukraine MANAFORT and GATES did so without registering and providing the disclosures required by law20 As part of the scheme in February 2012 MANAFORT and GATES solicited two Washington DC firms (Company A and Company B) to lobby in the United_States on behalf of Yanukovych the Party of Regions and the Government of Ukraine For_instance GATES wrote to Company_A that it would be representing the Government of Ukraine in [Washington] DC21 MANAFORT repeatedly communicated in person and in writing with Yanukovych and GATES passed on directions to Company_A and Company_B For_instance MANAFORT wrote Yanukovych a memorandum dated April 8 2012 in which he provided Yanukovych an update on the lobbying_firms activities since the inception of the project a few weeks ago It is my intention to provide you with a weekly update moving forward Toward the end of that first year in November 2012 GATES wrote to Company_A and Company_B that the firms needed to prepare an assessment of their past and prospective lobbying efforts so the President could be briefed by Paul on what Ukraine has done well and what it can do better as we move into 201322 At the direction of MANAFORT and GATES Company_A and Company_B engaged in extensive lobbying Among other things they lobbied multiple Members of Congress and their staffs about Ukraine sanctions the validity of Ukraine elections and the propriety of Yanukovychs imprisoning his presidential rival Yulia Tymoshenko (who had served_as Ukraine President prior to Yanukovych) MANAFORT and GATES also lobbied in connection with the roll out of a report concerning the Tymoshenko trial commissioned by the Government of Ukraine MANAFORT and GATES used one of their offshore_accounts to funnel $4 million to pay secretly for the report23 To minimize public disclosure of their lobbying campaign MANAFORT and GATES arrangedfor the Centre to be the nominal client of Company_A and Company_B even though in fact the Centre was under the ultimate direction of the Government of Ukraine Yanukovych and the Party of Regions For_instance MANAFORT and GATES selected Company_A and Company_B and only thereafter did the Centre sign contracts with the lobbying_firms without ever meeting either company Company_A and Company_B were paid for their services not by their nominal client the Centre but solely through off-shore accounts associated with the MANAFORT-GATES entities namely Bletilla Ventures Limited (in Cyprus) and Jeunet Ltd and Global Endeavour Inc (in Grenadines) In total Company_A and Company_B were paid more_than $2 million from these accounts between 2012 and 201424 To conceal the scheme MANAFORT and GATES developed a false and misleading cover story that would distance themselves and the Government of Ukraine Yanukovych and the Party of Regions from the Centre Company_A and Company_B For_instance in the wake of extensive press reports on MANAFORT and his connections with Ukraine on August 16 2016 GATES communicated false talking_points to Company_B in writing includingCompany B through a principal replied to GATES the same day that theres a lot of email traffic that has you much more involved than this suggests [] We will not disclose that but heaven knows what former employees of [Company B] or [Company A] might say25 In September 2016 after numerous recent press reports concerning MANAFORT the Department of Justice informed MANAFORT GATES and DMI that it sought to determine whether they had acted as agents of a foreign_principal under the Foreign_Agents Registration_Act (FARA) without registering In November 2016 and February 2017 MANAFORT GATES and DMI caused false and misleading letters to be submitted to the Department of Justice which mirrored the false cover story set out above The letters both of which were approved by MANAFORT and GATES before they were submitted represented among other things that26 In fact MANAFORT and GATES had selected Company_A and Company_B engaged in weekly scheduled calls and frequent emails with Company_A and Company_B to provide them directions as to specific lobbying steps that should be taken sought and received detailed oral and written reports from these firms on the lobbying work they had performed communicated with Yanukovych to brief him on their lobbying efforts both congratulated and reprimanded Company_A and Company_B on their lobbying work communicated directly with United_States officials in connection with this work and paid the lobbying_firms over $2 million from offshore_accounts they controlled among other things In_addition court-authorized searches of MANAFORT and GATES DMI email accounts and MANAFORTs Virginia residence in July 2017 revealed numerous documents including documents related to lobbying which were more_than thirty-days old at the time of the November 2016 letter to the Department of Justice27 United_States citizens who have authority_over certain foreign_bank accounts whether or not the accounts are set_up in the names of nominees who act for their principals have reporting obligations to the United States28 First the Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations require United_States citizens to report to the United_States Treasury any financial interest in or signatory authority_over any bank account or other financial_account held in foreign countries for every calendar year in which the aggregate balarice of all such foreign accounts exceeds $10000 at any point during the year This is commonly known as a foreign_bank account report or FBAR The Bank Secrecy Act requires these reports because they have a high degree of usefulness in criminal tax or regulatory investigations or proceedings The United_States Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is the custodian for FBAR filings and FinCEN provides access to its FBAR database to law_enforcement entities including the Federal Bureau of Investigation The reports filed by individuals and businesses are used by law_enforcement to identify detect and deter money_laundering that furthers criminal enterprise activity tax evasion and other unlawful activities29 Second United_States citizens also are obligated to report information to the IRS regarding foreign_bank accounts For_instance in 2010 Form 1040 Schedule B had a Yes or No box to record an answer to the question At any time during [the calendar year] did you have an interest in or a signature or other authority_over a financial_account in a foreign country such as a bank account securities account or other financial_account If the answer was Yes then the form required the taxpayer to enter the name of the foreign country in which the financial_account was located30 For each year in or about and between 2008 through at_least 2014 MANAFORT had authority_over foreign accounts that required an FBAR report Specifically MANAFORT was required to report to the United_States Treasury each foreign_bank account held by the foreign MANAFORT-GATES entities noted above in paragraph 12 that bear the initials PM No FBAR reports were made by MANAFORT for these accounts31 For each year in or about and between 2008 through at_least 2013 GATES had authority_over foreign accounts that required an FBAR report Specifically GATES was required to report to the United_States Treasury each foreign_bank account held by the foreign MANAFORT-GATES entities noted above in paragraph 12 that bear the initials RG as well as three other accounts in the United Kingdom No FBAR reports were made by GATES for these accounts32 Furthermore in each of MANAFORTs tax filings for 2008 through 2014 MANAFORT represented falsely that he did_not have authority_over any foreign_bank accounts MANAFORT and GATES had repeatedly and falsely represented in writing to MANAFORTs tax preparer that MANAFORT had no authority_over foreign_bank accounts knowing that such false representations would result in false MANAPORT tax filings For_instance on October 4 2011 MANAFORTs tax preparer asked MANAFORT in writing At any time during 2010 did you [or your wife or children] have an interest in or a signature or other authority_over a financial_account in a foreign country such as a bank account securities account or other financial_account On the same day MANAFORT falsely responded NO MANAPORT responded the same way as recently as October 3 2016 when MANAFORTs tax preparer again emailed the question in connection with the preparation of MANAFORTs tax_returns Foreign bank_accounts etc MANAPORT responded on or about the same day NONE33 After MANAFORT used his offshore_accounts to purchase real_estate in the United_States he took out mortgages on the properties thereby allowing MANAFORT to have the benefits of liquid income without paying taxes on it Further MANAPORT defrauded the banks that loaned him the money so that he could withdraw more money at a cheaper rate than he otherwise would have been permitted34 In 2012 MANAFORT through a corporate vehicle called MC Soho Holdings LLC owned by him and his family bought a condominium on Howard Street in the Soho neighborhood in Manhattan New_York He paid approximately $2850000 All the money used to purchase the condominium came from MANAFORT entities in Cyprus MANAFORT used the property from at_least January 2015 through 2016 as an income-generating rental property charging thousands of dollars a week on Airbnb among other places In his tax_returns MANAFORT took advantage of the beneficial tax consequences of owning this rental property35 In late 2015 through early 2016 MANAFORT applied for a mortgage on the condominium Because the bank would permit a greater loan amount if the property were owner-occupied MANAFORT falsely represented to the bank and its agents that it was a secondary home used as such by his daughter and son-in-law and was not a property held as a rental property For_instance on January 26 2016 MANAFORT wrote to his son-in-law to advise him that when the bank appraiser came to assess the condominium his son-in-law should [r]emember he believes that you and [MANAFORTs daughter] are living there Based on a request from MANAFORT GATES caused a document to be created which listed the Howard Street property as the second home of MANAFORTs daughter and son-in-law when GATES knew this fact to be false As a result of his false representations in March_2016 the bank provided MANAFORT a loan for approximately $318500036 Also in 2012 MANAFORT through a corporate vehicle called MC Brooklyn Holdings LLC similarly owned by him and his family bought a brownstone on Union Street in the CarrollGardens section of Brooklyn New_York He paid approximately $3000000 in cash for the property All of that money carne from a MANAFORT entity in Cyprus After purchase of the property MANAFORT began renovations to transform it from a multi-family dwelling into a single family home In late 2015 through early 2016 MANAFORT sought to borrow cash against the property The institution MANAFORT went to for the loan provided greater loan amounts for construction loans that is loans that required the loan amounts to be used to pay solely for construction of the property and thus increase the value of the property serving as the loans collateral The institution would thus loan money against the expected completed value of the property which in the case of the Union Street property was estimated to be $8000000 In early 2016 MANAFORT was able to obtain a loan of approximately $5000000 after promising the bank that approximately $1400000 of the loan would be used solely for construction of the Union Street property However MANAFORT never intended to limit use of the proceeds to construction as required by the loan contracts In December 2015 before the loan was made MANAFORT wrote his tax preparer among others that the construction loan will allow me to pay back the [another Manafort apartment] mortgage in full Further when the construction loan closed MANAFORT used hundreds of thousands of dollars from the construction loan to make a down payment on another property in California37 Paragraphs_1 through 30 and 32 through_36 are incorporated here38 From in or about and between 2006 and 2017 both dates being approximate and inclusive in the District of Columbia and

news_conference eliciting groans from critics wary of four years of what as alternative factsBut a few brave souls chose to go high on social_media and look at the positive aspects of living in Spicers worldHow wonderful would it be to use #AlternativeFactsin our everyday livesIt could be the best news since last yearAnd just like that #SeanSpicerSays and #SeanSpicerFacts were bornI ate a salad for lunch today Mari Dwyer (@maridwy) Guess the number of jelly beansMe 87Wife 134Sean Spicer 15 million Mark Zohar (@markzohar) For those who missed it Spicer graced the lectern of the White_House briefing room on Saturday to dispute the mainstream medias efforts to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the Mall during Trumps inaugurationMetal detectors slowed peoples arrival to the mall he said White floor coverings used for the first time highlighted empty spaces making it look as though fewer people had showed up And the reckless media put out a false narrative playing down how many came out to support TrumpHis key point No one had numbers because the National Park Service which controls the Mall does_not put any outSpicer then goes on to list a few numbers that back up his assertion that Fridays crowd was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration period both in person and around the globe That touched off a brief flurry to determine whether Spicer had spoken correctlyFor example crowd estimates can be fuzzy but Metro keeps count of every person who uses a Metro card to hop onto a train and Spicer mentioned Metro numbers in his remarksAccording to Metro Fridays ridership was the lowest in at_least two presidential inaugurationsAs people took 570557 trips in the system between its early 4 am Friday opening through its midnight closingThe figures are significantly lower than those from the 2009 and 2013 inaugurations of President_Barack Obama 11 million trips in 2009 and 782000 in 2013 according to MetroAnd The

secretaryAmong the things he posted for his 129 million followers a Sunday morning declaration that the White_House had not issued a statement on the Womens March on Washington a day after the inauguration despite conflicting reportsHe also retweeted the White_House correspondent for Time who erroneously reported that Trump had removed a bust of the Rev Martin Luther King Jr from the Oval_Office Miller used Twitter to apologize to his colleaguesApology accepted Spicer tweeted and later he added this admonishment A reminder of the media danger of tweet first check facts laterA few_minutes before the sun rose over Mar-a-Lago President Trump was up thumbing a series of tweets about Barack_Obama and some of the darker days of 20th century American historyIn particular he was just before the 2016 election tactics Trump said hearkened to the McCarthy hearings and Red Scare of the late 1940s and 50sNothing found Trump tweeted This is McCarthyismTerrible Just found out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump_Tower just before the victory Nothing found This is McCarthyism Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) McCarthyism is something of which Trump should have in-depth knowledgeHis lifelong attorney and mentor Roy Cohn one of the men who helped mold Trump into Trump was as one author called it Joseph McCarthys sidekick - whose lifelong mentor was Joseph McCarthys sidekick - complains of modern-day McCarthyism today West_Wing Reports (@WestWingReport) After World_War II McCarthy a Republican senator from Wisconsin that large numbers of communist spies and sympathizers had infiltrated the US government and needed to be weeded outThe accusations happened during a period of escalating tensions with the Soviet Union and growing fears about the global spread of communism McCarthy interrogated alleged sympathizers at Senate hearings that came to bear his name Just an accusation could ruin reputations and careers Cohn was the brains behind McCarthys rise to power and to many Americans one ofthe first real television personalities according to Mr Cohn with his slick hair dark complexion and heavy-lidded eyes the obit said was frequently seen whispering in the senators earEventually though Cohns influence in Washington waned as McCarthy and his hearings lost public supportDecades later after Cohn returned to New_York he had Trumps earThey first met in New_York in October 1973 when Trump was 27 and beginning to make his fortune in his familys real_estate business Cohn then 46 was a high-profile defense lawyer with connections in city government and in the courtsHe used his connections to reward friends and punish opponentsaccording toThere were however legions of Cohn detractors He was a source of great evil in this society Victor A Kovner a Democratic activist in New_York City and First Amendment lawyer told OHarrow and BoburgHe was a vicious Red-baiting source of sweeping wrongdoing Cohn represented Trump and his dad Fred when they faced Justice_Department allegations that they discriminated against black rental applicants atthe apartment complexes the family owned or managed according to OHarrow and BoburgOn Dec 12 1973 Cohn called a news_conference saying they were suing the government for $100 million over the allegations In an affidavit Cohn said the government was trying to force subservience to the Welfare DepartmentThe Trumps ultimately settled the case with the government without admitting guilt and declared victoryIn the late 70s and into the 1980s Cohn fought efforts to have him disbarred Through it all Trump was a loyal friend trophy client and protegeRoy had a whole crazy deal going but Roy was a really smart guy who liked me and did a great job for me on different things Trump told The_Post according the story published in June And he was a tough lawyer and thats what I wanted Roy was a very tough guyMore than a year ago the Fact_Checker various claims that Donald Trump then a presidential_candidate had made about Hillary_Clintons alleged role in the approval of the sale of a Canadian company Uranium_One with mining rights in the United_States to Rosatom Russias nuclear energy agency Weve delved deep into the tale and recently since Rep Devin_Nunes head of the House_Intelligence Committee announced thatCongress would launch a new probeHerewe are going to take a closer look at a key claim that the sale involved 20_percent of our uranium Look at how often Tucker Carlson brought up this line in a recent show saying it was insane for Clinton not to realize that a Russian company was getting 20_percent of our uranium supplySebastian Gorka a former Trump White_House aide that Clinton should be tried and potentially executed because the Russians infiltrated our national_security to corner the uranium market and they succeededWe have noted repeatedly thatextracted uranium whichRosatom does_not have but even so this 20_percent figure is especially misleading At the Fact_Checker we a bit more preciselyas mining licenses for about 20_percent of US uranium_extraction capacity But we were out of date it turns out20 percentis an especially stale numberThe original 20_percent figure one of the agencies that approved the deal in 2010 It stated that as of 2010 the licenses represent approximately 20_percent of the currently licensed uranium in-situ recovery production capacity in the United StatesIn-situ recovery (ISR) is to obtain uranium from underground its the main method in the United_States Its generally used for low-grade ore that would be otherwise too expensive to mine A solution is pumped into the ore deposit to dissolve the uranium The resulting liquid is then pumped back out driedso itbecomes yellowcakeandplaced in 55-gallon drumsbefore it is taken to a uranium conversion facility for eventual use in a nuclear power reactorButthe 20_percent number was a 2010 estimate that has now been overtaken by events such asadditional mining licenses being issued The Energy Information Administration has and the Uranium_One assets now represent much less_than 20_percent production capacity because other US operations have been approvedThe NRC has licensed additional in-situ uranium facilities since the 20-percent figure was estimated (and it was an estimate) an NRC spokesman said in an email Our current estimate would be closer to 10 percentThe spokesman added Note also that even the original figure does_not include conventional mines and was nowhere near saying they controlled 20_percent of US uranium reservesUranium One has and may be looking to unload more an industry official said Thats because the US holdings were incidental to the Rosatom purchase of Uranium_One it was more interested in the companys holdings in Kazakhstan the worlds leading uranium producerProduction capacity is one thing but the reality is actual production In fact so much Kazakh uranium is flooding the market that uranium prices have dropped and production in the United_States has plummetedThe industry official said total US production in 2017 is expected to be less_than 1000 tons and production in 2016 was just 1126 tons By contrast Uranium_Ones mines in Kazakhstan alone extracted nearly 3000 tons in 2016Uranium Ones US business has shrunk so quickly that it now represents a tiny part of US production In 2016 its Willow Creek facility extracted just 23 tons Thats 23 percent of all US production In 2015 the project represented 36 percent of US production and in 2014 113 percent In 2013 it was still 20_percent Two other Uranium_One facilities currently are not being minedThis chart shows how Uranium_Ones US production compares with total US production and how US production compares with worldwide production Uranium production in the US is so small that I would rarely if ever use a statistic like that Its meaningless said a nuclear expert_at the Middlebury_Institute of International_Studies at Monterey Twenty percent of bupkis is still bupkisA spokesman for Nunes did_not respond to a request for commentThe 20_percent figure has long been in wide circulation As we noted the Fact_Checker recently used it though with caveats But we should have looked at the actual production data and asked the NRC for an updated estimate of production capacity Clearly thenumber is woefully out of dateGiven that Uranium_Ones production is only 2 percent of an already small total US production not 20_percent the overwrought claims that Clinton gave away 20_percent of the US nuclear supply or that Russia controls that much US uraniumare simply absurd()Do you rate this claim as true or false More Pinocchios for false fewer based on your opinion of the statements truthfulness (The check mark means you think the statement is true not that you agree with the rating)We need to verify that you are an actual person This is a non-scientific user poll Results are not statistically valid and cannot be assumed to reflect the views of Washington_Post users as a group or the general populationWandering through Times Square past the Naked Cowboy and the Elmos and the ticket touts she could be any immigrant trying to live the American DreamA 60-year-old Korean woman with a soft perm and conservative clothes shes taking a weekend off from pressing shirts and hemming pants at the dry-cleaning business she runs with her husbandBut shes not just any immigrant Shes an aunt to Kim_Jong Un the young North_Korean leader who has with a hydrogen bombAnd for the past 18 years since defecting from North_Korea into the waiting arms of the CIA she has been living an anonymous life here in the United_States with her_husband and three children My friends here tell me Im so lucky that I have everything Ko Yong Suk as she was known when she was part of North_Koreas royal family told The Washington_Post on a recent weekend My kids went to great schools and theyre successful and I have my husband who can fix anything Theres nothing we can envyHer husband previously known as Ri Gang chimes in with laughter I_think we have achieved the American DreamThis is the story of how one family went from the top of North_Korea to middle AmericaBreaking their silence in the United_States Ko and Ri spent almost 20 hours talking to two Washington_Post reporters in New_York City and then at their home several hours drive away They were nervous about emerging from their anonymity after all there are Americans who analyze North_Korea for a living and do not even know that the couple are hereThey asked The_Post not to publish the names they use in the United_States or to reveal where they live mainly to protect their grown children who live normal professional livesKo bears a striking resemblance to her sister Ko Yong Hui who was one of Kim_Jong Ils wives and the mother of Kim_Jong Un the third-generation leader of North_Korea And she had a particularly close relationship with the man now considered one of the United_States top enemies She took care of Kim_Jong Un while he was at But in 1998 when Kim_Jong Un was 14 and older brother Kim_Jong Chol was 17 Ko and Ri decided to defect Kos sister their link to the regime was sick with terminal breast cancer although she did_not die until 2004 and the boys were getting older The couple apparently realized that they would not be needed by the regime much longer and fled concerned about losing their privileged statusThe Kim family has ruled North_Korea for 70 years through a repressive system built on patronage and fear The royal family and top cadres in the Workers_Party benefit from this system and have the most to lose if it collapses or if they run afoul of the regimeSo the couple decided to flee not to South_Korea as many North_Koreans do but to the United StatesThey have worked long hours running their dry-cleaning store and their three children have come of age here going to good colleges and getting good jobsThe family home is a large two-story house with two cars in the driveway a huge TV in the living room a grill on a rear deck Theyve been to Las Vegas on vacation and two years_ago went to South_Korea where Ko enjoyed visiting the palaces she had seen in TV dramasThey look like a normal familyBut look closer That photo of her eldest son on a jet-ski Its at Wonsan where the Kim family has its summer residence That girl in the photo album Its Kim Yo Jong who runs the propaganda division of the Workers PartyAnd the house It was bought partly with a one-time payment of $200000 that the CIA gave the couple on their arrival they saidEven though Ko and Ri have not seen Kim_Jong Un in almost 20 years and do not appear to have held official positions US intelligence on North_Korea is so thin that this couple still represents a valuable source of information on the family courtThey can reveal for example that Kim_Jong Un was born in 1984 not 1982 or 1983 as has been widely thought The reason theyre certain It was the same year that their first son was born He and my son were playmates from birth I changed both of their diapers Ko said with a laugh Sometimes operatives from the CIAs national clandestine service come to town to show Ko and Ri photos of North_Koreans and ask who the people areThe CIA declined to confirm or comment on any of Ko and Ris claims Some parts of the couples history can be verified but other parts cannot or seem incompleteEven today Ri in particular is sympathetic toward the North_Korean regime and is trying to get approval to visit Pyongyang And both are careful in what they say about their to whom they refer as Marshal Kim_Jong UnBut what they will say about their former charge paints a picture of a man who was raised knowing that he would one day be king In 1992 Ko Yong Suk arrived in Bern Switzerland with Kim_Jong Chol the first son of Kos sister and Kim_Jong Il who in two years would become the leader of North_Korea Kim_Jong Un arrived in 1996 when he was 12We lived in a normal house and acted like a normal family I acted like their mother Ko said about her time in Bern I encouraged him to bring his friends home because we wanted them to live a normal life I made snacks for the kids They ate cake and played with LegosTraveling on a diplomatic passport Ri went back and forth between North_Korea and Switzerland sometimes ferrying their youngest daughter and Kim_Jong Uns younger sister back and forthThe family spoke Korean at home and ate Korean food but also enjoyed the benefits of an expatriate family in an exotic locale Ko took the Kim children to Euro Disney now Disneyland Paris Kim_Jong Un had been to Tokyo Disneyland with his mother some years before and her photo albums are full of pictures of them skiing in the Swiss Alps swimming on the French Riviera eating at al fresco restaurants in ItalyKim Jong_Un loved games and machinery trying to figure out how ships float and planes fly He was already showing personality traits that would later become much more evidentHe wasnt a troublemaker but he was short-tempered and had a lack of tolerance Ko recalled When his mother tried to tell him off for playing with these things too_much and not studying enough he wouldnt talk back but he would protest in other ways like going on a hunger strikeKim loved going home for the summer spending time in Wonsan where the family has a huge beachfront compound or at their main residence in Pyongyang with its movie theater and plenty of room to hang outHe started playing basketball and he became obsessed with it his aunt said of the young Kim who was a Michael Jordan fan and later hosted basketball player several times in North_Korea He used to sleep with his basketballHe was shorter than his friends and his mother told him that if he played basketball he would become taller Ko saidLater at their house Ri produced a never-publicly seen photo laminated and stored in an envelope of a slightly built Kim aged 13 and his older brother among a team wearing basketball uniforms after a tournament in Pyongyang Ri is sitting in the front row while Ko is standing in the back Kim is holding a gold trophyThe world did_not know that Kim had been anointed his fathers successor until October 2010 when his status was made official at a Workers_Party conference in Pyongyang But Kim had known since 1992 that he would one day inherit North KoreaThe signal was sent at his eighth birthday party attended by North_Koreas top brass the couple said Kim was given a generals uniform decorated with stars and real generals with real stars bowed to him and paid their respects to him from that moment onIt was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person when the people around him were treating him like that Ko saidFrom a humble background Ko was catapulted into the top echelons of North_Korean society when her sister a performer caught the eye of the princeling Kim_Jong Il and she became his third partner in 1975I was very close to my sister and it was a tough job to be the wife so she asked me to help her She could trust me because I was her own blood Ko saidKim Jong_Il personally selected Ri to marry his sister-in-law They all lived in a compound in Pyongyang with Ko looking after her sisters and her own children for several years We lived the good life Ko said Over a sushi lunch in New_York she reminisced about drinking cognac with sparkling water and eating caviar in Pyongyang about riding with Kim_Jong Il in his Mercedes-BenzThen came the charmed years in Europe But in 1998 Kos sister discovered she had breast cancer and underwent treatment in Switzerland and FranceThis is where Ko and Ris version of events starts to become opaque Given that Ri is trying to get back into Kim_Jong Uns good graces he has reason to present their defection as nothing but altruisticThe way Ri and Ko tell it the cancer treatment in Europe was not working so they decided they should travel to the United_States to try to secure treatment for Kos dying sister Their defection was all about trying to save Kim_Jong Uns mother they sayStories about the couple in the South_Korean news media have suggested that they sought asylum in the United_States because they were concerned about what could happen to them after either of Kim_Jong Uns parents died This was their link to the royal family and without that link what would happen to themWalking through Central Park on a Sunday morning Ko seemed to imply that this was a concernIn history you often see people close to a powerful leader getting into unintended trouble because of other people she said I thought it would be better if we stayed out of that kind of troubleThey had reason to be scared given Kos sisters position said Michael Madden editor of the websiteKo Yong Hui was an ambitious woman she wanted her sons to be promoted and she made enemies in the process Madden said If you were her sister or her brother-in-law you would feel threatened Someone could easily make you disappear Just look at the case of the uncle who also lived in the Pyongyang compound with Ko and Ri He apparently built up too_much power In 2013 Kim had him executedSo one day in 1998 Ri and Ko and their three children took a taxi to the US Embassy in Bern They said they were North_Korean diplomats and wanted asylum After several days during which time a Korean speaker flew in from Washington they were taken to a US military base near FrankfurtThey stayed in a house on the base for several months while they were questioned Then Ri and Ko disclosed their family connectionsThe American government didnt know who Kim_Jong Un was that he would become the leader Ri saidThe US government did_not tell its ally South_Korea that it had Ko and Ri until they were on American soil apparently infuriating the government in SeoulFor US intelligence_agencies which struggle to get reliable information about the inner workings of the North_Korean regime the defection must have seemed like hitting the intelligence jackpotBut Ri insists they did_not know much They thought we must know some secrets but we didnt know anything he said We were just looking after the children and helping them study so of course we saw a lot of their private lives but we had nothing to do with defense We didnt know any nuclear or military secretsMadden said the pair would have had limited intelligence value Alexandre Mansourov a North_Korean leadership expert who once studied at Kim_Il Sung University in Pyongyang agreedYes they understand the system very well he said However they missed the famine and the recovery the transition to the new leadership and all the events of the last five_years In that sense theyre living in the past When they landed in the United_States the family spent a few days in the Washington area not far from the CIA before moving to a small city where a South_Korean church had offered to help them as it did for others who escaped the NorthThe people at the church kept asking us questions They knew we were from North_Korea but they told us we didnt look like North_Koreans They kept asking us questions Ko saidSo the family moved to a different city with very few other Koreans or even other AsiansLife was hard at the beginning We had no relatives and we were working for 12 hours every day Ri said He worked as a builder then did maintenance in an apartment house jobs that were easy to do without EnglishKo was frustrated at not being able to work and contribute The only thing I could do without speaking the language was dry cleaning she said in Korean Ri speaks reasonable English today but Kos is still basicSo they opened a small store and began working long hours Ri at the machines and Ko doing alterations They soon hit their stride Seeing my kids doing well in school and my husband working so hard gave me the strength and energy to carry on Ko saidTheir children have no interest in Korea North or South she said They have a comfortable existence but certainly do not appear to be living large Stopping at a gas station for lunch on the way back to their home Ko remarked that bottled water was very cheap and was disappointed that the Dunkin Donuts was out of burritos So why are they breaking their silence nowRi says he wants to visit North_Korea and has come out of their deep cover to dispel what he calls lies being peddled about them and their family in North_Korea by regime critics in South KoreaLast year Ri and Ko moved to sue three high-level North_Korean defectors who had been on South_Korean television accusing them of a variety of activities including having plastic surgery and stealing millions of dollars from the Kim regime The couple hired a celebrity lawyer Kang Yong-seok to pursue a defamation case but it was thrown out on a technicality Kang arranged for The Washington_Post to meet the couple and was present for most of the interviews in New YorkEven after the years the couple has spent in the United_States North_Korea still has some pullRi who is particularly careful around reporters not to speak ill of the regime is positioning himself as the person to bridge the widening gap_between Washington and PyongyangMy ultimate goal is to go back to North_Korea I understand America and I understand North_Korea so I_think I can be a negotiator between the two he said If Kim_Jong Un is how I remembered he used to be I would be able to meet him and talk to himMansourov described Ris hopes to return to North_Korea as ridiculousHe has a nice life in the US Why would he want to go back Unless hes ready to go upstairs he saidKo said she misses her home town the pull of the home town cannot be underestimated in Korean culture but does_not want to go back Nor does she want Ri to visit But how can I change my stubborn husbands mindLuckily for Ko that decision is Kim_Jong Uns And hes not showing any interest in having an intermediary anytime soon to help him improve relations with the United_States Yoonjung_Seo contributed to this reportSEOUL - The South_Korean political system has been shaken to its core over the revelations that from Choi_Soon-sil a friend of 40 years who held no official position and had no policy backgroundThe saga began with a simple and apparently self-contained incident The chief_executive of Nature Republic a South_Korean cosmetics company was arrested for gambling in Macau in November 2015Gambling is illegal for South Koreans and is punishable with prison time even if the South_Korean citizen is caught gambling abroadChung Woon-ho the executive was found guilty and sentenced to a year in prisonDuring the appeal process Chung had a legal dispute with his attorney In the process of probing this dispute a typically South_Korean act of corruption was uncovered involving a prosecutor a businessman and a government officialBut this time it was really serious involving the former chief of the prosecutors office a high-ranking judge the conglomerate Lotte and a senior secretary to the presidentThe investigation uncovered the existence of Lotte slush funds and ended with the suicide of Lottes vice chairman who left a note taking full responsibility The former chief of the prosecutors office and the judge were arrestedHowever the senior secretary to the president and a former senior prosecutor Woo Byung-woo walked away unscathedEight months later South_Koreas biggest newspaper the broke news of another scandal involving a business a prosecutor and a government official A familiar name surfaced again Woo Byung-wooThe Chosun Ilbo reported that an Internet game company Nexon did a favor for Woo by buying his familys land for $120 millionat a time that they were having a trouble selling it The allegation was that the land had been bought in return for Woo turning a blind eye on a prosecutors unlawful gains from Nexon sharesWoo had been in charge of vetting this prosecutor for promotion in 2015The nation was incensed by this allegationof systemic corruption in the justice system The fact that Woo was not investigated only increased suspicion that it was he who held the real power inside the presidential office enough to influence the national justice system Local media began calling him an emperorThen a further Chosun Ilbo investigation led to yet_another government official being exposed for abusing his power This time it was another senior secretary to the president An Chong-bumAn had allegedly been strong-arming conglomerates to donate money to the newly established MI-R FoundationAn had reportedly used the threat of painful audits to extort money from as many as 30 conglomerates Local media reported that it was suspected that An had been raising money that was to be for Parks personal use after she retires in 2018 The former head of the MI-R Foundation later said in an interview with the Chosun Ilbo that he was told Woo at the presidential office and the prosecutors office had their backJust as the Chosun Ilbos focus was moving ever closer to the president herself one of the lawmakers in Parks ruling managed to deflect attention away from this embarrassing probe and back on to the newspaper byhighlighting the fact that the Chosun Ilbos chief writer had received expensive trips from Daewoo a shipping company in 2011The incident significantly damaged the papers reputation and it suspended its reporting on the relationship betweenthe foundation and the presidential officeThen another local newspaper the left-leaning Hankyoreh brought the story back to life with asurprising twistItpublished a story that named Choi_Soon-sil as the de-factoowner of the MI-R Foundation Choi had been friends with Park since the 1970s and was the daughter of Choi Tae-min a cult founder who was believed to have had huge influence over Park until his death in 1994Park Geun-hye and Choi Tae-mins strange relationship was an open secret in South_Korea but had never been investigatedAs the investigation rolled on suspicion grew concerning Choi Soon-sils undue influence 14 shell companies were linked to her in Germany then a friend claimed that Chois favorite hobby was changing Park Geun-hyes speechesPark initially dismissed the allegations as mere rumors but when a cable channel reported on Oct 24 that the presidents speeches had been found on Choi Soon-sils tablet computer such denials were no_longer plausibleThe president has since made but these have not beenenough to assuage the publics growing anger and tens of thousands ofcitizens have taken to the streets over the past twoweeks calling for her resignationParks approval rating has plummeted to 5 percent according to Gallup Korea the lowest for a president in the polls historyThe investigation isonly just beginning but already Parks senior secretary An Chong-bum and Choi_Soon-sil have been arrested for abuse of power and attempted fraud and corporate officials from conglomerates including Samsung are being questioned by prosecutorsEmperor Woo Byung-woo was also summoned for questioning Sunday As the senior secretary to the president for civil affairs Woos role is to monitor corruption of the people close to the president How he will come out of this scandal remains to be seenNo one knows where the chips may fall in this ongoing saga but this much is clear What began with one businessman playing cards at a table in Macau has now grown into since its democratization in 1987In the most abstract sense there is nothing noteworthy about a government official meeting with an ambassador from a foreign country When such an interaction becomes important is when that official is an ally of a presidential campaign thats got a complex set of possibly inappropriate relationships with other representatives of that ambassadors country and when that official whileunder oathsays he did_not have communications with representatives of that countryWhat were going to endeavor to do here is to parse out that complex set of relationships using the information we have at hand In this case as youve hopefully ascertained the country at issue is Russia and the campaign is that of President Trump The official of course is And the ambassador is at this point the linchpin of a lot of the interactions between Trump and the rest of his teamWell consider three Russian entitiesAs for the American side lets start at the top and move outward through Trumps network Trumps connections to Russian business_interests are murky thanks to his decision not to release his tax_returns during the campaign We know that the Miss_Universe pageant was hosted in Moscow when Trump owned it and that he millions of dollars for doing so We know too that hes repeatedly explored real_estate deals in the country Its not clear whether Trump has met Kislyak though the ambassador a foreign_policy speech Trump gave last spring and the reception that preceded it We know now that Trump has been in communication with Putin but he also claimed to have been in contact with representatives of the Russian president (and Putin himself) Sessionss relationship with Kislyak is well-established by now This is a good point at which to note though that the existence of that relationship does_not in any way imply wrongdoing by Sessions Its just part of the network were establishing Trumps son-in-law (Ivankas husband) also met with Kislyak during the period between Election_Day and the inauguration according to Kushner also has some loose connections to Russian business_interests according to the including an investment from tech investor Yuri Milner in a real_estate investment company and a friendship with the wife of oligarch Roman Abramovich (She was to the inauguration as Ivanka Trumps guest) Flynn had a number of contacts with Kislyak after Election_Day including attending that meeting between the ambassador and Kushner (Flynn was forced to resign his position after that his comments about the content of those meetings to Vice_President Pence were falsehoods) After resigning from the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 Flynn was invited to give a paid speech at a celebration of RT He did so and joined Putins table for a related banquet The younger Trump visited France last October to to an obscure Russian group In 2008 Don Jr who works for the Trump Organization told a real_estate conference that Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets and that we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia Manaforts links to Russian interests are New revelations that emerged during the campaign prompted Trump to demand Manaforts resignation Manafort is one of the Trump campaign staffers who made contact with Russian interests during the campaign Before he was confirmed to serve as the head of the State_Department even Republicans Tillersons relationship to Putin As the head of ExxonMobil Tillerson helped negotiate a massive agreement between the Russian_government and a partnership between the two companies Tillerson was subsequently the Order of Friendship by PutinBeing a friend of Vladimir is not an attribute I am hoping for from a MR Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) Rosss connections to Russian business_interests are less obvious than Tillersons During the Clinton administration Ross served on the board of the an effort to bolster businesses in post-Cold-War Russia During his confirmation questions arose about his ownership of a bank on Cyprus that in the words of caters to wealthy Russians Stones connection to Russia is murky During the campaign he drew attention for seeming to have inside knowledge on the releases that have been linked to Russian interests by the government More directly the Times that Stone is possibly under investigation by the US government for his links to Russia Page is included in that alleged investigation as well but his links to Russia are more clear Page pretty clearly met with Kislyak last_year during the Republican convention in Cleveland as he to MSNBCs Chris Hayes on Thursday night He also has repeatedly Russian business groups in that country including twice in 2016 Over a decade ago he worked in Russia as an investment banker Page is far in the outer orbit of Trumps circle serving briefly as part of Trumps national_security advisory team Hes joined there by Gordon a onetime Pentagon spokesman who also served_as an adviser to the campaign Gordon like Page spoke with Kislyak in ClevelandThis document should be considered a work in progress As more information is released it (and the graphic) will be updated Again none of the relationships above are intended to show misbehavior by those involved The broad question at stake is the extent to which Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 election and if it did the extent to which it may have leveraged relationships with Trumps team to that end That much-bigger question is much harder to evaluateWhen President Trump took the oath of office his administration on the website replacing former president Barack_Obamas policy goals with new prioritiesBut at_least one page remains that allows the people to call on the White_House to take action on the issue that matters to youAnd the people apparently want to see Trumps tax_returns created Friday asks the administration to immediately release Donald Trumps full tax_returns and says it wants Trump to not be in conflict with the Emoluments Clause of the ConstitutionThe unprecedented economic conflicts of this administration need to be visible to the American people including any pertinent documentation which can reveal the foreign influences and financial interests which may put Donald Trump in conflict with the emoluments_clause of the Constitution the petition says Less than a day after the petition was created it eclipsed the enough to elicit an official response from the White_House at_least according to the Obama-era promise that remains on the petitions pageKellyanne Conway a senior adviser to Trump issued a response on national television Sunday morningThe White_House response is that hes not going to release his tax_returns she told George Stephanopoulos on ABCs This Week We litigated this all through the election People didnt care they voted for him And let me make this very clear most Americans are very concerned with what their tax_returns will look like while President Trump is in office not what his look likeAs A Post-ABC poll last_week showed that Trumps continued refusal to release his tax_returns continues to be an unpopular decision with 74 percent of Americans saying he should make the documents public including 53 percent of RepublicansPresidents Wagner noted are not required to release their tax_returns but presidents dating back to Richard Nixon have routinely done so voluntarilyThere were a handful of other petitions created during inauguration weekendalso focuses on Trumps money demanding he divest or put in a blind trust all of the Presidents business and financial assets One asked Trump to Another sought the repeal of the removing restrictions on gun ownership Oh and some people But by far the most popular petition was the one demanding Trumps tax_returns As of Monday morning it had been signed by more_than 250000 peopleIt seeks documentation about foreign influences and financial interests that could put Trump in conflict with the Emoluments ClauseThe little-known constitutional provision prohibits a president from accepting a gift or a benefit from a foreign leader It was drafted by the Founding Fathers to prevent the leaders of the fledgling United_States from being under the financial thumb of a foreign country like France or EnglandBut Trumps critics say the billionaire businessman was violating the Constitution the moment he swore an oath to protect and defend itRon Fein the legal director at Free Speech for People that there are several examples of Trump violating the Emoluments Clause including rent paid by the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China for its space in Trump_Tower in New_York and spending by foreign diplomats at the Trump properties including his hotel in Washington a few blocks from his new home Sunday night that a liberal watchdog group says it plans to file a lawsuit against President Trump in federal court on Monday alleging that he is in violation of the Emoluments ClauseTrump has claimed he would donate profits from foreign business clients to the US Treasury although he hasnt said exactly how hed track collect and disburse such payments according to GoldAnd even if hes found to be in violation of the Emoluments Clause it is unclear_whether a violation of it qualifies as treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors that could lead to Trumps impeachmentTrumps refusal to release his tax_returns became a heated issue on the campaign trailOn Jan 11 during Trumps first official news_conference since winning the election he continued to resist suggestions to release the returnsThe only ones that care about my tax_returns are the reporters Trump said You learn very little from a tax returnTrump also pointed to an ongoing audit as the reason he couldnt release his tax returnsIm not releasing the tax_returns because as you know theyre under audit he saidSenior White_House counselor Kellyanne_Conway this week to only one of President Trumps executive_orders namely his temporary ban on refugees and travel from seven Muslim-majority countries and not enough to the many others Trump has signed since taking officeSo Seth Meyers did just thatOn Tuesdays Late Night With Seth Meyers the comedian used a segment called The Check In to delve into a less-discussed executive_order specifically one with a few exceptionsThe order arguably been covered less_than Trumps travel_ban possibly in part because it has not triggered numerous protests and lawsuits nor does its fate rest with Nevertheless Meyers persistedThe stated that no vacant positions existing at noon on January 22 2017 may be filled and no new positions may be created except in limited circumstances Military personnel and other positions deemed necessary to meet national_security or public safety responsibilities were exemptedIn his segment Tuesday Meyers pointed out that the hiring freeze seemed to run counter to one of Trumps most frequent campaign promises that he can fix the problems with how poorly the Department of Veterans Affairs was run And hes right about that For many years now under both Bush and Obama many parts of the VA have been found guilty of fraud and of providing shoddy health_care to our veterans Meyers said Now one of the main problems at the VA is that many departments including VA hospitals are chronically understaffed But one of Trumps first moves as president was to put a freeze on federal hiringMeyers cut to footage of White_House press_secretary Sean_Spicer saying that the focus on VA staffing was overblown and that hiring more people was not the answerHiring more people is not the answer Meyers said sarcastically Unless the question is Where are all the (expletive) people Does anyone work here Meyers also noted that the hiring freeze had the potential to hurtveterans in another way since they receive a preference in federal hiringAs on the day the executive action was signedVeterans who make up 31percent of the federal workforce could also be disproportionately affected by the move because they receive a hiring preference when it comes to federal jobs One unit of the Pentagon according to an official who asked for anonymity to discuss personnel matters is in the process of hiring between 20 and 30 veterans and is now looking at whether to put the hires on holdDepending on how the exemptions are interpreted according to New_York University public service professor Paul Light the freeze might affect fewer than 800000 employees or more_than one-fifth of the overall federal workforceA lot of the people affected by this freeze are people who served this country people for whom Trump promised to fight Meyers said And instead hes making it harder for them to assimilate back to civilian life by in some cases taking away their ability to work In the rest of the segment Meyers summarized Trumps complicated history with veterans issues He opened by cycling through a handful of clips of Trump talking_about veterans throughout his campaignThe vets Oh those vets I love those vets Were going to take care of those vetsIve worked hard for the vetsTheres nobody bigger or better at the military than I amMeyers did credit Trump for to help build a Vietnam veterans memorial in New_York City But Meyers also reminded viewers that cutting to another clip in which Trump explained I had a foot thingDuring his transition Trump was criticized for his lack of outreach to veterans groups Meyersmentioned a December post fromveterans advocate Paul Rieckhoff who was frustrated at the time that the president-elect had managed to fit rapper Kanye West into his schedulebut no major veterans groupsWow Time for Kanye But still a month after the election and no time for a single leader from a national veterans service organization Paul (PJ) Rieckhoff (@PaulRieckhoff) Meyers brought his Tuesday segment full circle by commenting on Trumps numerousexecutive orders in generalThis whole thing is just another example of Trump signing these executive_orders in haste without thinking about the consequences and in turn leaving a trail of chaos Meyers said You_know at first I thought he was just showing off his signature but now I_think hes going Hey could someone read this to me I feel like it might be a terrible ideaThe World Health Organization announced its first list of antibiotic-resistant priority pathogens on Monday detailing 12 families of bacteria that agency experts say pose the greatest threat to human health and kill millions of people every yearThe list is divided into three categories prioritized by the urgency of the need for new antibiotics The purpose is to guide and promote research and development of new drugs officials saidMost of the pathogens are among the nearly two dozen antibiotic-resistant microbes that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned in a could cause potentially catastrophic consequences if the United_States didnt act quickly to combat the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant infectionsThis list is not meant to scare people about new superbugs said Marie-Paule Kieny an assistant director-general at WHO Its intended to signal research and development priorities to address urgent public_health threats Superbugs that the WHO considers the highest priority are responsible for severe infections and high mortality rates especially among hospitalized patients in intensive care or using ventilators and blood catheters as well as among transplant recipients and people undergoing chemotherapy While these pathogens are not widespread the burden for society is now alarming she saidIncluded in this highest-priority group is CREor carbapenem-resistant which US health officials have dubbed In some instances it kills up to 50 percent of patients who become infected An elderly Nevada woman who died last_year contracted an infection caused by CRE that was resistant to allavailable in the United StatesAlso in the first-tier group is the infections tied to it typically occur in ICUs and settings with very sick patients The other bacteria tagged as a critical prioritywhich can be spread on the hands of health-care workers or by equipment that gets contaminated and is not properly cleanedWHOs list follows that world leaders held last fall only the fourth time they had addressed a health issue at the UN General Assembly The lists second and third tiers the high and medium priority categories cover bacteria that cause more common diseases such as and food poisoning caused by salmonella While not associated with significant mortality rates they have a dramatic health and economic impact particularly in low-income countries Kieny saidAlthough there has been renewed interest and in antibiotics because of the growing threat that antibiotic resistance poses much of the work is more focused on antibiotics with a broad range she saidWe have to focus specifically for a much smaller range of bacteria targeting the three highest-priority pathogens Kieny saidDrug companies have also tended to focus more on Gram-positive bacteria that tend to colonize the skin of healthy individuals and generate less resistance said Evelina Tacconelli who heads the infectious diseases division at the University of Tbingen in Germany which helped develop the WHO list By comparison Gram-negative bacteria more frequently colonize intestinal reservoirs and can cause sepsis and severe urinary tract infections especially among elderly patients There have been no new classes of antibiotics discovered that have made it to market since 1984 according to the Pew Charitable Trusts antibiotic-resistance project And there arent enough drugs to meet future needs Allan Coukell senior director of health programs at Pew said MondayOf the 40 antibiotics in clinical development in the United_States fewer than half even have the potential to treat the pathogens identified by WHO he said And based on history most of those will fail to reach the clinic for reasons of efficacy or safety So the outlook is grimHistorical data show that generally only one of five drugs that reach the initial phase of testing in humans will receive approval from the Food and Drug AdministrationDeveloping antibiotics to treat highly resistant bacterial infections is especially challenging because only a small number of patients contract these infections and meet the requirements to participate in traditional clinical trialsPublic health experts welcomed the announcement including the need to address the problem in a comprehensive fashionWhile research and development are essential we cannot just discover and develop our way out of this crisis said Helen Boucher an infectious diseases doctor at Tufts University and a spokeswoman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America Prevention the appropriate use of antibiotics and surveillance are all necessary as part of a coordinated approach she saidIn the United_States antibiotic-resistant infections kill an estimated 23000 Americans each year according to the CDC Global estimates are difficult because there is no uniform way to include antimicrobial resistance in causes of death But experts say that drug-resistant infections especially those caused by the WHOs highest-priority pathogens double or triple the risk of deathWe are talking_about millions of people affected Tacconelli saidTuberculosis whose resistance has been growing in recent years was not included in the list because it is targeted by other dedicated programs WHO saidHere is the list from WHO1 carbapenem-resistant 2 carbapenem-resistant 3 carbapenem-resistant ESBL-producing4 vancomycin-resistant 5 methicillin-resistant vancomycin-intermediate and resistant 6 clarithromycin-resistant 7 spp fluoroquinolone-resistant 8 Salmonellae fluoroquinolone-resistant 9 cephalosporin-resistant fluoroquinolone-resistant10 penicillin-non-susceptible 11 ampicillin-resistant 12 spp fluoroquinolone-resistantunnecessaryOn Jan 7 North_Koreas state_media shocked the international_community by announcing the of a hydrogen_bomb test Many international observers in South_Korea and the West whether North_Koreas nuclear_test was actually a hydrogen_bomb like Kim_Jong Un alleged or similar to what it had tested previously Then on Feb 7 North_Korea launched a long-range missile that put a satellite into_orbit seen as a demonstration that the country had ballistic_missiles that can aim those weapons at the WestNorth Korea has clearly tested another nuclear device bringing not just from Western countries but more alarmingly for Pyongyang from its traditional allies Russia and ChinaWhy would North_Korea risk steepened international sanctions at a time when its economy has been ravaged by the worst drought in a centuryHeres why To strengthen Kim_Jong Uns totalitarian grip on power at a time when the regime has been losing its ability to reward loyal elites with revenues derived from and has resorted to violent purges to punish That makes sense when you consider these five factorsKims father Kim Jong-Il took power relatively easily in 1994 Thats because he had been heir-apparent as early as 1980 gradually gaining authority_over the North_Korean military But Kims takeover in December 2011 was relatively sudden because he was only one year before his fathers death As a result the new Dear Leader had very little time to establish his credibility among the ruling elites before taking powerAnonymous accounts from Pyongyang elites recently revealed that many believed Kim has an born out of a lifetime of privilege and shouldnt be leader within the North_Korean military-industrial complex are battling over whether Kims military investments and China policy are the right strategies Some are challenging Kims authority so severely that the regime has begun But thats a short-term Band-Aid not a long-term strategyUsing nuclear_weapons to rally the country has a history In 1962 the Democratic_Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK) hyper-militarization and nuclear_weapons development that would enable the country to defend itself from any US and South_Korean aggression without help from the Soviets or Chinese Since Kim_Il Sung launched North_Koreas nuclear program in the 1980s North_Korean elites have believed that a boosts the nations international statusThats true not because it demonstrates military might Nuclear tests bring international media attention which boosts North_Korean pride Scott Snyder and Kyung Ae-Park argue in their 2013 book that North_Korean aggression brings the Democratic_Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK) welcome geopolitical recognitionWhen the United_States sends former presidents to engage in diplomatic negotiations with the DPRK regime thats a massive PR victory and boosts Kims status and power State-level diplomatic recognition also contributes greatly to the legitimization of North_Korea Leaders like argue for a North_Korean seat at the bargaining table on nuclear security issues which strengthens Kim reassuring elites that the nation is not entirely isolated internationallySuccessfully testing a hydrogen_bomb strengthens Kims claim to know what hes doing as he invests the nations scarce resources in developing nuclear technology It proves that he can lead Whats more it gives Kim heightened stature as a patriotic hero since neither his father nor his grandfather was able to build and test a hydrogen bombNo one believed North_Koreas official announcement that with the newly tested hydrogen_bomb the DPRK could now And yet the announcement reinforced Kims deeper message The UnitedStates remains a hostile power encircling North_Korea and nuclear_weapons are essential to combat that threatNothing brings a group together like a big bad enemy and thats exactly what does Consolidate elite and popular backing for the regime Thats why the regime has for decades fed the public educational propaganda and state-run news media reports to remind citizens of the proof that America is an ever-threatening enemyThat anti-Americanism runs deep at all levels of society Its part of why even the more independent-thinking elites accept Kims with the West even if that might end sanctions relieve starvation and poverty and bring more international aid Kim reminds them that after Libyan dictator renounced weapons of mass destruction the West backed the colonels overthrow and the nation has been in chaos sinceNorth Korea may depend on China to keep from starving and yet it has recently been extremely belligerent toward its patron as if Kim is proving that money cant buy obedience The DPRKs recent include the January hydrogen_bomb test and the February rocket launchLee Jung Hoon a noted professor of international relations at Seouls Yonsei University contends that China views Kim as an Kim has North_Korea wants to make clear that its an independent ally not its patrons proxy or puppetBut China is stuck It doesnt want putting almost 25 million starving refugees at its border Thats why it keeps pledging and delivering assistance And North_Korea exploits that quite effectively realizing that China has no choice but to support it no matter what In other words the China-North Korea partnership is a not a genuine allianceBut why would North_Korea launch a nuclear_test and satellite nowMany regional observers believe its because in May Pyongyang will hold a historic the first gathering of ruling party members since 1980 that Kim called a Workers_Party Congress because he wants to formalize authority and power structures Even though Kim retains totalitarian control over the North_Korean state challenges from dissident factions have caused him to reinforce his legitimacy through established political institutionsLee Cheol-woo a member of South_Koreas parliamentary intelligence committee recently argued that North_Koreas hydrogen_bomb test was aimed_at that Kim could celebrate at the Congress rallying the elites so that they will back him as he consolidates powerHeres what all this means Unfortunately North_Koreas recent hydrogen_bomb and missile_tests are not irrational actions by a rogue dictatorship Rather they are strategic moves aimed_at consolidating Kims leadership position domestically Belligerence fuels pro-regime nationalism boosting Kims status so that he can tighten his grip on power Thats why hes willing to antagonize long-time allies and suffer through still more international sanctionsAll of which means that North_Korean aggression will_continue to be one of the most intractable security problems in the Asia-Pacific regionNorth Korea is touting technological progress in its nuclear program saying after a nuclear_test Friday that it can now produce smaller lighter and diversified nuclear warheads of higher strike power But it is also making strides in its missile program analysts say advances that could enable it to outsmart missile_defense systems which could make the missiles more attractive to potential customersNorth Korea conducted what it called a nuclear_warhead explosion test Friday The country has conducted only five nuclear_tests since its program began but this is the third since Kim_Jong Un took power at the end of 2011 and its second this year Under Kims leadership North_Korea has also sharply accelerated the pace of missile testing with almost two dozen launches this year alone While many of this years tests have not been successful and there are still many unknowns about North_Koreas nuclear and missile_programs there have still been noticeable and concerning improvementsIt seems like North_Korea is trying to qualitatively improve its missiles and develop options to evade or fool US missile defenses said director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association If this continues unchecked they could develop an_intercontinental ballistic_missile that could pose a threat to the United_States in the next decadeIn North_Korea launched three medium-range missiles Monday as China which had joined the international condemnation of last months submarine-launched_ballistic missile was hosting the Group of 20 summit in HangzhouThe rockets flew about 600_miles putting Hangzhou within range But they were sent in the other direction falling inside_Japans air defense identification zoneArms control experts have since been poring over photos of the launches released by the North_Korean media shows three missiles being launched in the space of a minute from trucks parked on a highway south of Pyongyang The location is within the security belt protecting Kim and the other regime elites in the capital said Michael Madden editor of the website That meant the drills could be simulating the collapse of the state or the presence of hostile forces within the country he said by on But it was the modifications to the missile that surprised the rocket scientists at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation_Studies in Monterey Calif It appears that North_Korea has extended the distance a short-range Scud can fly making it halfway between a Scud and a medium-range missile which the North_Koreans call the Rodong That means that a longer-range missile could be wheeled out on an existing Scud transporter obviating the need to produce new trucks Syria is among the countries thought to have bought short-range Scuds from North_Korea in about 2000This is a really nice upgrade said director of the East_Asia Nonproliferation Program in Monterey Countries looking to buy North_Korean missiles are probably looking at this and thinking Ooooh thats niceNorth Korea has been concentrating on developing road-mobile missiles that can be fueled in a shelter or tunnel instead of on a traditional launchpad that can be detected by satellites and theoretically invite a preemptive strikeJapans self-defense forces did_not detect Mondays launch in advance the Nikkei newspaper reported It said this underscored the limits of Japans traditional defense capability programIn the past when activity was seen around the launchpad Japans self-defense forces would roll out Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) interceptors at the Defense Ministry headquarters in Tokyo But road-mobile missiles can be readied for launch in a matter of minutes cutting the time available to respondJapan is very concerned that North_Korea has launched so many different missiles in such a short period said Atsuya Tanimoto of the Japanese Defense Ministrys intelligence analysis office North_Korea is improving its technology he said(Korean Central Television)North Korea also appears to be looking for other ways to avoid interception no doubt motivated by South_Koreas recent decision to host a Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defense_(THAAD) antimissile unit for the US military The battery is due to be deployed to a site south of Seoul next yearBut by firing the three missiles within the space of a minute rather_than over the usual course of an hour or so North_Korea appeared to be testing a way to make it more difficult to intercept incoming missiles said chief analytics officer at AllSource Analysis a Colorado-based consultant groupThis launch was probably designed to test not only operational readiness but to develop tricks to defeat antimissile defenses in Japan and South_Korea Bermudez said When you launch in a barrage at the same_time it complicates missile_defense So theyve shown they have not just the technological capability but the operational capability for simultaneous launchesFurthermore it appeared that the missile tested Monday separates after launch making it harder for missile_defense systems to interceptWhen a solid warhead remains attached to the missile its easier to hit because its a bigger target Lewis said If you were in Egypt staring at Israel you might really like a warhead like thisNorth Korea has not demonstrated any capacity to make a nuclear_warhead small enough to attach to a missile let alone the ability to deliver a nuclear-tipped missile to a targetStill the progress in its medium-range missile program follows observable advances in North_Koreas quest to launch missiles from sea as well as from land North_Korea was ridiculed for apparently Photoshopping a ballistic_missile launch from a submarine in May But last_month it successfully launched a missile from a submarine near its east coast port of Sinpo It flew about 300 miles toward Japan before falling into the seaThis showed that its missile program might be progressing faster than originally expected said John Schilling an aerospace engineer who studies North_Koreas missilesHowever this does_not mean it will be ready next week next month or even next year he for the 38 North websiteBut North_Koreas submarine-launched_ballistic missiles could be operational by the second half of 2018 he wroteConcurrent with making progress on its delivery systems North_Korea has also been refurbishing its old missile production infrastructureKim has toured the January 18 General Machinery Plant which makes sensitive missile components several times over the past_year During one visit he joked that it looked so good that visitors might think they were in a resort International sanctions_imposed through the United_Nations as well as direct sanctions from the United_States South_Korea and Japan have been designed to cut_off North_Koreas ability to buy parts for its nuclear and missile_programs as well as stanch financial flowsBut the steady rat-a-tat of missile_tests suggests that North_Korea has plenty of missile parts to play withSome American officials suggest that North_Korea might be racing against the clock trying to test and make as much progress as it can before the latest round of sanctions really bitesWhile Bermudez warned against getting too excited about the most recent developments saying they simply reinforce what had been seen previously Lewis said the developments should disabuse anyone of the notion that North_Korea was not serious about its missile programTheyre testing at a really fast rate because the program is real he said The idea that this is a Potemkin missile program is just nonsenseFake news identity theft Former Ms World Laura Hunter says she was turned into Gregory McCray (@g_mccray) The Conservative_Daily Post has a simple business model according to court_documents use blood-boiling stories to

or Bill Clintons involvement in an illicit sex ring She frequently pointed out just how distrustful the American mainstream media wasThe stories all of which happened to be articles from the Conservative_Daily Post were mostlyuntruea lawsuit says But they apparently seemed plausible to their target audience of conservative readers who widely shared many of the storiesHunter posted and the rumor-busting websites have debunked a few of the sites claims that have attracted a massive number of readersOne phony story claimed that the evidence for another story about an underground Clinton sex network was thinHunter it turns out is a real person though not the person her Facebook avatar led thousands to believe she was according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of the real Laura HunterThe suit filed in district court in Nevadas Clark County claims that the news site misappropriated Hunters name to transform her into a spokesperson for a radical right-wing website that peddles fake newsShes seeking compensatory damages and an injunction against the Conservative_Daily Post and an affiliated Facebook page using the name Conservative_Daily ReviewDefendants know that they have turned Ms Hunter into a Conservative online muck slinger of fake_news said the lawsuit And they must answer for itThe viewpoints expressed on the fake_news website are diametrically opposed to what [Hunter] believes her attorney Marc Randazza told The Washington PostTheyre not just cranking out problematic content he said but then theyre taking somebody and making them the face of it She just wants to clear her nameThe real Laura Hunteris a Washington state resident who The television actress and model has owned a photography business for 20 years according to the siteShes also politically left of center her attorney says not the conservative Tennessee pundit that the Conservative_Daily Post claimedShe came face-to-face with her Internet alter ego in October after an email from a man named Michael Powell according to the lawsuit Powell said he ran an advertising agency in Las Vegas and had a client who wanted to use Hunters head shot from a few years agoBut he dodged Hunters efforts to talk by phone according to court documentsIn another email he asked her to send more head shots ostensibly so he could persuade his client to use themWorried by the confusing conversations Hunter Googled herself The top return linked to the conservative activists page on FacebookThats when Hunter says she realized Powell had turned her persona into a highly rated spokesperson for a right wing political website called the Conservative_Daily ReviewAs she sleuthed around online Hunter noticed that the website contained the same photo Powell said he wanted to use in his original emailBeneath it was a bogus autobiography which has since been deletedLaura Hunter is a well-known blogger and political activist known for her constant stream on Facebook She has been in the

Powell is the president of Gravitas which owns the site according to court_documents The other men are listed as executive officersSince the lawsuit was filed Hunters picture has disappeared from the Facebook page In its place a cartoon image of a brunette woman with hazel eyesMany of the old clips written in her name have been documented in Hunters lawsuit which claims Powell and others had a sophisticated fake_news operation with a sizable staff Randazza saidThe proliferation of fake_news hit its apex during the 2016_presidential election mixed in with a steadychurn of political news and stories about the candidatesFor some it serves obvious political aims But others have made thousands hawking bogus stories to people seen as both gullible and hyperpartisanAs The Washington Posts There are a lot of variables that factor into exactly how_much a viral hoax story can make for its creator But if you take Facebook shares as an indirect indicator of how widely viewed some of these sites might be you start to understand why if optimized properly fake-news sites targeting hyperpartisan audiences can be lucrativeOne prolific fake_news writer that he makes $10000 a month from Googles Adsense A 23-year-old recent graduate from Davidson College that he churned out fake_news from his home office in Maryland and made about $1000 an hourFacebook and to a lesser extent Twitter are a big part of the fake_news business model according to Alexios Mantzarlis who headsPoynters International Fact-Checking Network A person with a viewpoint and a personality even a fake one isa better driver of traffic to a page than the publications brand account Mantzarlis said No one really knows these websites as their own things This is stuff that primarily shows up on news feedsMantzarlis said fake_news website are often built to churn out stories as quickly as possible which can lead to troubling mistakesIm not surprised Ive seen the stock pictures used and taken all the time This isnt rocket science Mantzarlis told The Washington_Post Fake news sites create content as fast as they can to get as much money as they can They dont do as much research or any research for their stories so they wouldnt do a lot of research when creating these Facebook personalitiesThe ethics of fake_news aside Randazza said hes amazed that no one at the company thought using Hunters name and face could end in legal troubleAt least in a lot of the cases that I get involved in you can at_least look at it and understand the logic behind some of the poor decisions he said Here I just dont knowThis liberal fantasy on steroids arrives courtesy of a satirical newssite designed to dive deeply under the skin of President Trump and anyone who supports himThe site channels the Onions humor the National Enquirers whacked-out headlines and the Huffington Posts progressive indignation Its a parody-based parallel universe whose creator intended for it to serve as a trap for Trump supporters online with a mocking masthead that says President Hillary Rodham ClintonIn recent_days and singled out the site as fake_news and a place for liberals to seek refuge from realityThe sites founder a 30-year-old East Coast writer who asked spoke on the condition of anonymityfor fear of becoming a conservative targetin real life told The Washington_Post that her conservative critics are partially correct Hillarybeattrump is meant to serve as a refuge from reality for liberalsBut mostly she said its a chance to troll the opposition whose party actually won the presidencyI wanted it to be a joyful middle finger the sites founder said when reached by phone I didnt want to wallow or argue with people who cant be argued with Theres something about humor as confrontation that I instinctively thought would work like a good right jab that I could keep using The joke it would seem is not hard to get even when the joke is just barely a joke Using humor as protest the site operates according to the plainly stated position that Clinton is in fact the 45th president of the United StatesIn the midst of a Constitutional crisis this is our response the sites About Us page states Long live the true president Hillary Rodham ClintonHow does she respond to critics who accuse her of perpetuating fake newsI empathize with people who feel frustrated that things they see on Facebook do not reflect reality as they see it she said But no I dont_think anyone can accuse me of misinforming the public en masse or undermining the collective intelligence of publics political discourse by writing fake_news that is so obviously satireShe decided to launch the site in January as a defense of Clintons legacy and now has five other writers providing additional content Although fake the stories often highlight Clintons actual policy positions such as raising the federal minimum_wage and guaranteeing paid maternity and paternity leaveThe sitealso serves to remind Trump supporters that the actual president lost the popular_vote to the fake president by enough voters to populate the city of Chicago a fact Trump has falsely If her bulging inbox of violent and misogynistic hate mail is any indication the bait appears to be working with some unsettling results Since Hillarybeattrumporg was picked up on the conservative-media radar the sites creator says its been getting about 200000 visitors per day enough to keep her busy deleting angry emails for a solid hour each nightIn recent_days she said news about the site bubbled up on 4chan and various subreddits before appearing on the Daily Caller and then Breitbart and Fox_News The entire journey from the fringes of the conservative map to the news spotlight took about 12 hours she saidNow as if on cue the furious email stream gushes any time she publishes a post that identifies Clinton as presidentYou can always find your paradise in heaven one reader said in an email the sites founder shared with The_Post Its just one bullet awayI know in your fake world she won but in the real world she did_not another reader said To the people who made this Web page go get a real job like the rest of real AmericansYour dad must have abused you while mom watched right another reader added YES Liberalism IS A METAL DISORDER and YOU ARE POOFThe founder said the vitriolic reaction says less about her content than it does about her new readersI think it has to be a deep sense of insecurity and I_think they also cant abide by dissent she saidIve been amazed by how willfully determined they are not to get the joke she added Browsing the site the notion of Clinton as commander in chief can feel temporarily realHeadlines regularly note the first female presidents skyrocketing approval ratings (89 percent according to one recent bulletin) new executive_orders furthering liberal causes and grammatically correct tweetsConservative media has blasted the headlines as a sort of pathetic alternative reality for bitter liberal snowflakes to the site as the ultimate safe space and said it offered Clinton supporters a place they can pretendThe websites tagline is News From The Real America Where The Majority Rules a reference of course to the oft-cited notion that the popular_vote actually means something Know a Clinton supporter who cant accept that Trump is the president Well theres a new satirical website just for them FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) https//twittercom/Brn2Wander1/status/834017335669358593htt r insane Special twitter & webpage for those who BELIEVE Crooked H is president Joey (@Vinny58222672) The sites founder seems to revel in the attention albeit anonymouslyFor a lot of people who feel like an important chapter was stolen from feminist history by the Russians by Julian Assange and by the FBI_director hillarybeattrumporg is restorative she saidShe devotes about 35 hours a week to the site and said she plans to keep it going as long as she can summon the energy though shes not making any money and considers it a labor of love Because Clinton offered decades of detailed policy prescriptions many of which will remain at the center of political discourse for years shell have no shortage of material to work with moving forward she saidIf hillarybeattrumporgs audience keeps growing through hate clicks or otherwise the sites founder might launch a YouTube spinoff perhaps a nightly newscast with headlines from Clintons first term in officeAlong the way of course she plans to continue to remind her readers that she believes the wrong person is in the White_House she saidIm unwilling to concede the legitimacy of this president she said I will_continue to gleefully sadistically emphasize Clintons landslide victory in the popular_vote on the site to underline the point that this Trump fellow has no business being presidentTwo senior members of President Trumps national_security team told lawmakers Monday that they believe they have the legal authority to conduct operations against terrorist groups including the Islamic_State and said there was no need for a new war authorization to replace the one passed immediately after the Sept 11 2001 attacks Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis also told the Senate Foreign_Relations Committee that any attempt to place time limits or geographical constraints in a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force could cripple efforts to fight terrorists Some lawmakers have said Congress needs to update laws that have provided authority to fight terrorist groups and detain militants including al-Qaeda and the Islamic_State on multiple continents If Congress decides to go ahead and write an updated law Tillerson and Mattis said lawmakers should not constrain the militarys ability to go after terrorists anywhere in the worldThemeans it will attempt to burrow into new countries and find safe havens said Tillerson using an acronym for the Islamic_State Our legal authorities for heading off a transnational threat like ISIS cannot be constrained by geographic boundaries Otherwise ISIS may reestablish itself and gain strength in vulnerable spacesMattis told the committee that time restrictions would also undermine combat operationsWe cannot put a firm timeline on conflict against an adaptive enemy who could hope that we havent the will to fight as long as necessary said Mattis who also stated that the Pentagon is Lawmakers mentioned the possibility of using military force in crises involving North_Korea Iran and Venezuela as well as the ongoing efforts against militant groups that change their name as often as a rock-and-roll band Mattis saidThe hearing was propelled by the in an apparent ambush as they patrolled in an area with groups loyal to both al-Qaeda and the Islamic StateSome members of Congress were taken aback by the About 800 Americans are based in Niger to run counterterrorism operations and train and advise local troops and hundreds more US forces are in other African countriesLaws enacted in 2001 and 2002 gave the military the legal authority to fight international terrorism Even though the United_States is fighting groups that didnt exist back then including the Islamic_State the legal basis remains sound Mattis said He urged Congress not to repeal existing law at_least without a new authorization already in place The uncertainty accompanying that situation could only signal to our enemies and our friends that we are backing away from this fight he said It would stall our operations immediately reduce allied commitments and support and create significant opportunities for our enemies to seize the initiativeA number of lawmakers said it is time to update the law to be more consistent with current conditions and threats Sen Tim Kaine (D-Va) and Sen_Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) are co-sponsoring a proposal providing new legal authority to combat al-Qaeda the Taliban and the Islamic StateThis is one of the most important topics the United_States Senate and this committee could ever consider Under what circumstances and legal authorities should the United_States send our men and women into war said Sen Benjamin L Cardin (Md) the top Democrat on the committeeFlake noted that not a single member of the committee was in the Senate when the original war authorizations were signed by President George_W Bush more_than a decade agoCongress needs to weigh in he said We have to make_sure our adversaries and our allies and most importantly our troops know that we speak with one voiceShortly before Tillerson and Mattis started testifying a small group of protesters in the room chanted Stop endless war before they were evictedThis has been a 16-year struggle said Sen Ron Johnson (R-Wis) I dont_think its going to be over any time soonin the eastern United_States this weekend but that wont stop the clocks from springing forward an hour with the return of daylight_saving timeAt 2 am Sunday (March 12) the clocks move ahead one hour and we leave standard time behind While the time shift costs us an hour of sleep evenings will be noticeably brighter again reminding us that the long bright days of spring are just around the cornerAfterthe time switch the sun will set around 7 pm or later in most parts of the countryFor manythe later sunset means no more commuting home in the dark and enough daylight for a round of golf or an evening runin the parkHere in Washington DC sunset will shift from 611 pm to 712 pm after DST begins on SundayCities straddling the western edge of time zones will enjoythe latest sunsets for example Atlanta or Indianapolis but theyll also have to contend with especially dark mornings these next few weeks In Indianapolis Sundays sunrise isnt until 8 amOne of the biggest arguments against daylight_saving time besides is the reduction in morning light after moving the clocks ahead Some argue that DST since they have to go to school in the darkWhile its true that daylight_saving time steals light from the morning many people forget that the sun will_continue to rise earlier for the nextthree months The arrival of spring means daylight is now increasing at its most rapid pace of the year which means that by mid-April sunrise will have caught up to where it was before DST beginsIn Washington DC sunrise shifts from 625 am to 723 am after we spring forward By April 19 sunrise will again be at 625 am as shown in the chart belowThe highera cityslatitude the more quickly sunrise catches up tothe same_time as it occurredbefore DST began Interestingly the dark mornings that result from daylight_saving time are more pronouncedin the southern tier where daylight changes more slowlythroughout the year In Miami for example it takes until mid-May for sunrise to return to the same_time it occurred before the time changeSwitching the clocks continually reignites debate about the but its easy to forget that doing sohelps redistribute daylight to moreuseful hours of the day If we were to scrap DST entirely and stay on standard time all year it would already be getting light around 5 am in late April and in many places as early as 4 am come JuneOf course whether you love or hate daylight_saving time More evening light is welcomed if you live in the eastern part of a time zone (such as Massachusettsor Maine) At the western edge of a time zone (Indiana or Michigan) daylight_saving time robs residentsof already scarce morning daylightAs long as DST remains in usethe century-old practice will_continue to have its supporters and detractors No one likes losing an hour of precious time and sleep but its a price worth paying for that extra hour of evening sunshineIn addition to charges_against President Trumps former campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort that were released on Monday there was another unexpected development in the investigation_into Russian_meddling in the 2016 electionGeorge Papadopoulos identified in March_2016 as an adviser to the Trump campaign during an interview with admitted to having provided false_statements to the FBI about his interactions with individuals tied to the Russian_government Papadopouloss credentials as a foreign-policy adviser were questioned immediately by observers a 2009 college graduate his LinkedIn page included his work with model United_Nations as an honor and awardAccording to a document unsealed by the FBI on Monday Papadopoulos admits to having been contacted by Russian agents shortly_after being identified as a campaign adviser contacts that continued for months After being arrested in July he then meets with authorities multiple times to answer_questions details revealed only once the Manafort indictment is made publicBelow a timeline of what the Papadopoulos learns that he will serve as an adviser to Trumps campaign (The timing isnt clear it may have been a day before or after this date) While in Italy Papadopoulos meets a professor based in London who is initially uninterested in Papadopoulos until Papadopoulos explains that hes working for Trumps campaign Papadopoulos is interested in the professor because the professor has links to the Kremlin which Papadopoulos believed would be useful in bolstering his position with the campaign Hillary_Clinton campaign_chairman John_Podesta is sent an email including a fraudulent link to change his Google password Its believed that this email was sent by an agent of the Russian_government and was used to illegally access his email account Trump meets with The_Post and several campaign advisers including Papadopoulos Papadopouloss credentials are quickly Papadopoulos and the professor meet in London They are joined by a woman who claims to be a niece of Russian President_Vladimir Putin The purpose of the meeting he later writes in an email to the Campaign Supervisor and several members of the Campaigns foreign_policy team (per the statement) is to arrange a meeting between Trump and PutinWho the campaign supervisor is isnt clear At that point the Trump campaign is being managed by Corey_Lewandowski In August The_Post that Sam_Clovis a campaign co-chairman who worked with the foreign_policy team had rejected the idea of a meeting over the short termWe thought we probably should not go forward with any meeting with the Russians until we have had occasion to sit with our NATO_allies he wrote in an emailFrom our reportIn the same email chain [adviser Navy Rear Adm Charles] Kubic the retired admiral reminded others about legal restrictions on meetings with certain Russian officials adding Just want to make_sure that no one on the team outruns their headlights and embarrasses the campaign Manafort is hired to manage the Trump campaigns delegate process At a campaign national_security meeting in Washington (also attended by Trump) Papadopoulos tells the group that he had connections that could facilitate a meeting with PutinTrump tweeted an image from the meeting Jeff_Sessions then a senator from Alabama is seated in the foreground and is speaking Papadopoulos is sitting two chairs to Sessionss left Trump is at the head of the table Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Papadopoulos emails the foreign_policy team to update them about ongoing discussions with the professor and Putins_niece He details his outreach to RussiaAt some point this month the Democratic_National Committees server is illegally accessed by hackers believed to be connected to the Russian_government Its the second such intrusion the first occurred in the summer of 2015 In an email exchange with the niece and the professor Papadopoulos mentions trying to set_up a potential foreign_policy trip to Russia The professor replies that it has already been agreed and mentions that hell be in Moscow later that month for meetings at the Russian Duma and a Valdai meeting (There is on April 19 that Mifsud attended)The niece replies I have already alerted my personal links to our conversation and your request As mentioned we are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr Trump The Russian Federation would love to welcome him once his candidature would be officially announced During the period that the professor says hell be in Russia he introduces Papadopoulos over email to a Russian who has connections with the Ministry of Foreign_Affairs Later from The_Post indicates that this may be Ivan Timofeev of the Russian International_Affairs Council Papadopoulos and the MFA connection (as the statement describes this person) have multiple conversations over Skype and email about setting up a meeting between the campaign and government officials The MFA connection and Papadopoulos discuss meetings in Moscow or London Papadopoulos and the professor meet in London At that meeting the professor tells Papadopoulos that while in Moscow he learned that the Russians had obtained dirt on then-candidate [Hillary] Clinton Per Papadopoulos the professor said that They have dirt on her the Russians had emails of Clinton they have thousands of emails Papadopoulos emails a senior campaign staffer to indicate that hes gotten some interesting messages He also emails a high-ranking campaign official to reiterate that Putin would like to host Trump The Posts August report indicates that the high-ranking official who was told about Putin wanting to meet was Lewandowski Papadopoulos emails the professor to thank him for his help saying that its history making if the meeting happens The MFA connection emails PapadopoulosI have just talked to my colleagues from the MFA it reads The[y] are open for cooperation One of the options is to make a meeting for you at the North America Desk if you are in MoscowPapadopoulos forwards this to Lewandowski and the next day to the campaign supervisor who is probably Clovis Lewandowski doesnt reply Clovis says [t]here are legal issues we need to mitigate meeting with foreign officials as a private citizen Papadopoulos emails another high-ranking campaign official Manafort according to The Posts August report informing him that Russia has been eager to meet Mr Trump for quite sometime and have been reaching out to me to discussManafort forwards the email to Rick_Gates (who was also indicted on Monday) We_need someone to communicate that [Trump] is not doing these trips he writes It should be someone low_level in the campaign so as not to send any signal Papadopoulos tries to set_up an off-the-record meeting between the campaign and Russian officials possibly including himselfThe Russian ministry of foreign affairs messaged and said that if Mr Trump is unable to make it to Russia if a campaign rep (me or someone else) can make it for meetings he emails a campaign official on June 19 I am willing to make the trip off the record if its in the interest of Mr Trump and the campaign to meet specific peopleThe meeting never happens WikiLeaks begins releasing emails stolen from the DNCDuring a news_conference Trump that Russia probably [has] her 33000 emails referring to emails deleted by Clinton after her service in the State_Department because her lawyers didnt believe them to be related to her tenure WikiLeaks begins releasing emails stolen from Podesta Papadopoulos is interviewed at the FBI During that interview he makes false_statements about the above interactions He claims The FBI interviews him again Papadopoulos deactivates his Facebook account It had included information about his conversations with the professor Robert Mueller is appointed as special_counsel to investigate Russian_meddling in the election Papadopoulos is arrested at Dulles Airport in Washington Papadopoulos [meets] with the Government on numerous occasions to provide information and answer_questions Hot Air that references to Papadopoulos in a request to seal his statement as a proactive cooperator matches a description used for witnesses who wear wires as part of investigations Papadopoulos admits that the statements he gave the FBI are false and agrees to the timeline and details above The statement of offense is unsealed the same day that indictments against Manafort and Gates are made publicSouth Korea abruptly shut_down an industrial complex just over the border in North_Korea on Wednesday cutting off a major source of income for the regime in Pyongyang as punishment for its extremely provocative In an unusually harshly worded statement Seoul flatly accused the North of using money made from inter-Korean projects for its nuclear and missile programsAbout $120 million flowed into North_Korea through the Kaesong industrial complex last_year alone the Souths Unification Ministry said In the 12 years since the complex was established North_Korea had made a total of about $560 million from the siteIt appears that such funds have not been used to pave the way to peace as the international_community had hoped but rather to upgrade its nuclear_weapons and long-range missiles the ministry said As a result President Park Geun-hyes government said it had completely shut_down the complex But the Unification Ministry statement said the international_community needed to come up with a vigorous response to a recent nuclear_test and rocket launch that exacts a price for North_Koreas misguided actions as well as extraordinary measures that compel North_Korea to give up its nuclear capabilities and change its waysSeparately Japan on Wednesday announced new unilateral economic sanctions on North_Korea in response to the tests banning North_Korean citizens from coming into Japan and North_Korean ships from calling at Japanese ports Transfers of money except for humanitarian gifts of less_than $800 will also be prohibitedMeanwhile South_Koreas Yonhap news_agency reported Wednesday that the North executed its army chief of staff Ri Yong Gil this month for corruption and factional conspiracy If true it would be the latest in a series of executions purges and disappearances under leader Kim_Jong UnLast month North_Korea carried_out its fourth_nuclear test claiming it tested a more powerful hydrogen_bomb but analysts say it was another atomic blast similar to the previous three On Sunday the North launched a rocket that it said carried a satellite into_orbit The West and allies however viewed the launch as another step in developing technology for a ballistic_missile programThe United_States South_Korea and Japan were already leading the charge at the United_Nations to impose another_round of sanctions on North_Korea in response to the nuclear_test when the rocket was launched Immediately after Sundays rocket launch Parks government said it was on deploying a Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defense_(THAAD) antimissile_system in South_Korea Seoul had been cautious about the move for fear of angering Beijing but the North_Korean tests appeared to have spurred Parks government into actionThe South also increased anti-regime broadcasts into North_Korea through loudspeakers lined up along the demilitarized zone that separates the two countriesCheong Seong-chang a North_Korea specialist at the Sejong Institute outside Seoul said that the South_Korean government appeared to be making emotional decisions when dealing with the Norths provocationsOpening a discussion with the US about THAAD which China and Russia are strongly against means that South_Koreas relations with these two_countries will get worse Cheong said But good relations with China and Russia is vital to work on sanctions on North KoreaPlus it would not have the desired impact because North_Korea could just get its workers to produce for Chinese companies he addedCompanies whose factories were shut_down were unhappyIt is unfair and emotional for the government to come to this conclusion without giving the companies any time to minimize possible damages said Chung Ki-sup head of the council of South_Korean companies in Kaesong according to local media reportsAfter similar tests in 2013 the South_Korean government promised that the Kaesong complex would be allowed to operate separately from politics he said We urge the government to review todays decision Chung saidAidan Foster-Carter a Korea analyst based in Britain called shutting down Kaesong stupid short-sighted and inconsistent Soon after Park was elected in 2013 she worked hard to reopen Kaesong after it was closed by the North and both_sides agreed that the

happens to have the exact same name asGeorge Papadopoulos the former Trump campaign adviser who pleaded_guilty to lying to federal officials earlier_this month When that plea was announced on Monday some people started tweeting at @feeonlyplanner a verified account for one George_Papadopoulos that pops up in a Twitter search That account belongs to the financial planner who also contributes to a Wall_Street Journal blog on wealth management and the former Trump adviser The Trump-connected Papadopoulos doesnt appear to have a verified accountWhen is your court date You lied to the FBI for the

visiting my elderly mother in Greece to attend to some of her affairs and of course enjoying her home cooking Papadopoulos told The_Post in an email on Monday afternoon I had finished an amazing lunch

foreign_policy adviser I have NO association with the Trump camp NONE George_Papadopoulos (@feeonlyplanner) But somehow that tweet seemed to trigger another_round of insults from random Twitter users

that would allow women who become pregnant as a result of a rape to terminate their attackers parental rights has received key legislative support and after nine years of failed attempts appears likely to be approved next year Senate President Thomas V Mike Miller Jr (D-Calvert) said last_week on social_media that he plans to co-sponsor the bill during the next legislative session which begins in JanuaryI have shared publicly and privately my disappointment that the Rape Survivor Family Protection Act did_not make it to the floor until Sine Die and did_not pass the Legislature in time Miller Senate Democratic leadership is going to make clear this [is] a priority and the bill will be taken up early Miller said he would co-sponsor the bill when the legislature reconvenes in January and would make it a top priority to make_sure victims of rape are protected and not forced to co-parent with their rapistEarlier this month House Speaker Michael E Busch (D-Anne Arundel) said he also planned to co-sponsor the bill and said it would be a top priority in the new sessionMontgomery County Democrats Del Kathleen M Dumais and Sen Brian J Feldman have been lead sponsors on the legislation for yearsThis protection is long overdue and victims of sexual assault need us to take action Busch wrote on FacebookAlmost 25 other states have passed similar laws The Maryland after key members of a conference committee panel could not reach a compromise over the House and Senate versions that two committee chairmen who appointed the conference panel did_not include female lawmakers in the group and waited until the end of the 90-day session to try to resolve the differences in the House and Senate versionsMuch of last years debate on the bill centered around whether an alleged rapist would have to be criminally convicted to have his parental rights revoked About 20 of the states who have such a bill require a rape conviction before terminating parental rightsAdvocates argued that Maryland allows parental rights to be terminated in child-abuse cases even when there is no criminal child-abuse conviction The same standard should apply they say in cases of sexual assaultUnder the bill a woman who sought to terminate a mans parental rights would have to prove through clear and convincing evidence the standard used in civil court that the man had sexually assaulted her The burden-of-proof standard is higher in criminal court where charges must be proved beyond a reasonable doubtWith days left in the 2017 session the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee struck language from the bill that said that courts could not require publication of the name of the mother or child in such cases and added language that said the father could refuse to testify or offer evidence in court The amendment forced the need for the conference committeeJake Weissmann deputy chief of staff for Miller said Monday that there were no details available about a compromise bill just a commitment that were going to get this done Lisae C Jordan executive director of the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assaults said it has been incredibly frustrating and

and commentary from talk_radio host Mark Levin suggesting that the Obama_administration used police state tactics to monitor the Trump team The Breitbart report circulated among Trumps senior aides Friday and early Saturday and Trump may have simply been reacting to the piece when he took to his preferred megaphone Twitter to trumpet his claimTrumps tweets punctuated a general feeling shared by the president his advisers and allies that Obama and the Deep State of critics within the intelligence_community who they think are fueling stories on Trump and Russia have been conspiring to derail his presidency At the heart of each of the presidents tweets is Trumps apparent belief that Obama himself as opposed to members of his administration had been personally overseeing surveillance of Trump TowerThe conservative media landscape including Sean Hannitys show on Fox_News and Infowars the conspiracy website run by Alex Jones outlets on which Trump has appeared has in recent_days given birth to tales of Obama and his closest confidants trying to spur Trumps impeachment or force his resignationBut separately the president is furious that a slow churn of revelations about communications between Attorney_General Jeff_Sessions ousted national_security adviser_Michael Flynn and other Trump associates and Russian officials has overshadowed the early weeks of his

that there would have been any sort of criminal or intelligence surveillance of Trump said Jennifer Daskal a former senior Justice_Department national_security official Theres no credible evidence yet to suggest that that happened It would be an extraordinary measure for the FBI to ask for and the court to grant a surveillance order on a presidential_candidate of the opposing party in an election year Most Republican leaders were quiet on the issue Saturday but Sen Lindsey O Graham (R-SC) vowed at a town hall meeting with constituents to get to the bottom of this He said it would be the biggest scandal since Watergate if Obama illegally spied on Trump or if a judge approved a warrant to monitor Trumps campaign for possible communications with RussiaIm very worried that our president

Weigel and Matt Zapotosky in Washington contributed to this reportThe Trump administration has enlisted senior members of the intelligence_community and Congress in efforts to counter news stories about Trump associates ties to Russia a politically charged issue that has been under as well as lawmakers now defending the White HouseActing at the behest of the White_House the officials made calls to news_organizations last_week in attempts to challenge stories about alleged contacts between members of President Trumps campaign team and Russian intelligence operatives US officials saidThe calls were orchestrated by the White_House after unsuccessful attempts by the administration to get senior FBI officials to speak with news_organizations and dispute the accuracy of stories on the alleged contacts with RussiaThe White_House on Friday acknowledged those interactions with the FBI but did_not disclose that it then turned to other officials who agreed to do what the FBI would not participate in White House-arranged calls with news_organizations including The Washington_Post Two of those officials spoke on the condition of anonymity a practice President Trump has condemnedThe officials broadly dismissed Trump associates contacts with Russia as infrequent and inconsequential But the officials would not answer substantive questions about the issue and their comments were not published by The_Post and do not appear to have been reported elsewhereWhite House spokesman Sean_Spicer confirmed that the White_House communicated with officials with the aim of contesting reporting on Russia but maintained that the administration did nothing improper When informed by the FBI that [the Russia-related reporting] was false we told_reporters who else they should contact to corroborate the FBIs version of the story he said The decision to involve those officials could be perceived as threatening the independence of US spy agencies that are supposed to remain insulated from partisan issues as well as undercutting the credibility of ongoing Those officials saw their involvement as an attempt to correct coverage they believed to be erroneousThe effort also involved senior lawmakers with access to classified intelligence about Russia including Sen Richard Burr (R-NC) and Rep Devin_Nunes (R-Calif) the chairmen of the Senate and House intelligence committees A spokesman for Nunes said that he had already begun speaking to reporters to challenge the story and that at the request of a White_House communications aide Chairman Nunes then spoke to an additionalreporter and delivered the same message Unlike the others Nunes spoke on the record and was subsequently quoted in the Wall_Street JournalIn an interview Burr acknowledged that he had conversations about Russia-related news reports with the White_House and engaged with news_organizations to dispute articles by the New_York Times and CNN that alleged repeated or constant contact between Trump campaign members and Russian intelligence operatives Ive had those conversations Burr said adding that he regarded the contacts as appropriate provided that I felt I had something to share that didnt breach my responsibilities to the committee in an ongoing investigationThe administrations push against the Russia coverage intensified Sunday when White_House Chief of Staff said in television interviews that he had been authorized by the top levels of the intelligence_community to denounce reports on Trump campaign contacts with Russia as falsePriebuss denunciations ranged from calling the articles overstated to saying they were complete garbageAdministration officials said that Priebuss comments had been cleared by FBI Director_James B_Comey and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe In doing so the FBIs leadership would appear to have been drawing a distinction between authorizing comments by a White_House official and addressing the matter themselves Mark Warner the ranking_Democrat on the Senate_Intelligence Committee said he called CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Burr to express his grave concerns about what this means for the independence of the investigationI am consulting with members of the Intelligence_Committee to determine an appropriate course of action so we can ensure that the American people get the thorough impartial investigation that they deserve free from White_House interference Warner said in a statement Friday nightRep Adam B Schiff (Calif) the ranking_Democrat on the House_Intelligence Committee issued a statement Friday evening saying that if the White_House contrived to have intelligence officials contradict unfavorable news reports this represents a new and even more grave threat to the independence of the intelligence communityFormer intelligence officials expressed concern over the blurring of lines between intelligence and politics with some recalling Republican accusations that the Obama_administration had twisted intelligence in its accounts of the 2012 attacks on US facilities in Benghazi LibyaI doubt that there was any enthusiasm from the intelligence leadership to get involved in this in the first place former CIA_director Michael Hayden said noting that it seemed unlikely that Priebuss bluntly worded denials were consistent with the precise language favored by intelligence analystsThink Benghazi here Hayden said in an interview by email This is what happens when the intel guys are leaned on for the narrative of the political speakers The latter have different rules words purposes Getting intel into that mix always ends unhappily [and] it looks like we just didThe Trump administrations actions reflect its level of concern about coverage of its relationship with Russia Trump has continued to praise Russian President_Vladimir Putin even after US intelligence_agencies concluded that to help Trump winTrump has also repeatedly disparaged the intelligence_agencies that his administration last_week turned to for support Shortly before taking office Trump accused US spy agencies of a to smear himThe White_House statements on the issue Friday came after CNN reported that the to publicly knock down media reports about ties between Trump associates and Russian intelligenceAdministration officials disputed the account saying that rather_than soliciting FBI feedback Priebus had been pulled aside by McCabe on the morning of Feb15 and told I want you to know that the New_York Times story is BSThe FBI declined to discuss the matterWhite House officials declined to comment on the administrations subsequent effort to enlist other government officials and would not agree to allow the identification of the intelligence officials who had spoken to The_Post last_week In separate calls those individuals insisted on being identified only as a senior intelligence official in the Trump administration and a senior member of the intelligence communityIn a brief interview on the night of Feb15 the senior intelligence official said that the suggestion that there was frequent contact between Russians and Trump associates was false describing any conversations as sporadic limited and based on Russias interest in building a relationship with the future Trump administration rather_than shaping the 2016_presidential raceThe senior intelligence official appeared to be referring to contacts between Trumps designated national_security adviser_Michael Flynn and Russian_Ambassador Sergey_Kislyak before Trump was sworn in as president Flynn was forced out of his job earlier_this month after The_Post reported that against Russia with Kislyak and then misled Trump administration officials about the nature of his contactsOfficials at the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on whether senior officials at those agencies had discussed Russia coverage with the White_House or been involved in efforts to refute stories on that subjectCIA Director Mike Pompeo is the senior-most intelligence official in the administration with former senator Dan Coats (R-Ind) still awaiting confirmation as director of national intelligenceAs a Republican member of Congress in the House investigation of Benghazi which centered on accusations that the Obama_administration had twisted intelligence about the attacks for political purposesIt is not unusual for CIA leaders to have contact with news_organizations particularly about global issues such as terrorism or to contest news accounts of CIA operations But involving the agency on alleged Trump campaign ties to Russia could be problematicThe CIA is not in charge of the investigation Given the history of domestic espionage abuses in the United_States CIA officials are typically averse to being drawn into matters that involve US citizens or might make the agency vulnerable to charges that it is politicizing intelligenceA US intelligence official declined to discuss any Pompeo involvement except to say that he was not involved in drafting or approving statements for public use by the White_House this past weekend on alleged Russian contactsWhether there were such contacts remains a major point of contention Beyond Flynn the investigation has focused on other figures including Trumps former campaign_chairman who had previously served_as a paid political adviser to the Putin-backed president of UkraineUS intelligence reports cite multiple contacts between members of Trumps team and Russians with links to the Kremlin during the campaign and afterward according to officials who have seen them Such reports were based on intercepted Russian communications and other sources the officials said Nunes who served_as a member of Trumps transition team has resisted calls for his House committee to investigate alleged contacts between Trump associates and Russia He said in an interview that after months of investigations US authorities have turned up no_evidence of such contactsTheyve looked and its all a dead trail that leads me to believe no contact not even pizza-delivery-guy contact Nunes said appearing to rule out even unwitting contact between Trump officials and Russian agents Investigators Nunes said dont even have a lead Philip Rucker Ellen_Nakashima and Julie Tate contributed to this reportPresident Trump just backed down from what could have been a serious fight with ChinaOn Thursday evening in Washington he appeared to shy away from confrontation with Beijing by agreeing to honor the one-China_policy during a lengthy telephone call with Chinas President_Xi JinpingThe move is set to ease tensions between the worlds two most_powerful nations relations had been inflamed after Trump suggested he would only commit to the one-China_policy if Beijing addressed his concerns about trade and currency issuesExperts had previously noted with concern that Trump had not spoken to Xi since his inauguration despite speaking or meeting with at_least 18 other world leaders although the two men did talk by phone days after Trumps election victory In a statement issued late Thursday the White_House said the two men had held a lengthy and extremely cordial conversationThe two leaders discussed numerous topics and President Trump agreed at the request of President_Xi to honor our one-China_policy the White_House statement saidIn return Xi said he appreciated his US counterpart Donald Trump for stressing that the US government adheres to the one-China_policy which he called the political basis of relations between the two nations state news_agency Xinhua reportedThe development of China and the United_States absolutely can complement each other and advance together Both sides can absolutely become very good cooperative partners Xi saidThe one-China_policy was first agreed by President Nixon and Chinas leader Mao Zedong in 1972 and formed the bedrock for the establishment of diplomatic ties under President Carter in 1979 It rules out independence and diplomatic recognition for the island of TaiwanTrumps insistence that it was open for negotiation had brought a sharp rebuke from China which insisted the policy was highly sensitive and non-negotiableIt was not clear if Trump had gained any concessions from China in return for endorsing the policy Xinhua said the two men agreed to strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation in trade economic investment and international affairsMuch more likely experts said Trump might simply have been persuaded that relations would never get off the ground without endorsing the one-China ideaLawyer James Zimmerman former head of the American_Chamber of Commerce in China said Trump never should have raised the one-China_policy in the first place and had now backed down probably because he realized it was a complicated thorny issue that is simply not open for discussion There is certainly a way of negotiating with the Chinese but threats concerning fundamental core interests are counterproductive from the get-go he said The end result is that Trump just confirmed to the world that he is a paper tiger a zhilaohu someone that seems threatening but is wholly ineffectual and unable to stomach a challengeNi Feng deputy director of the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing said Trumps previous comments had sent the relationship between the two_countries tumbling and collapsing adding that he believed that was why the phone_call had been delayedWithout acknowledgement of the one-China_policy Sino-US_relations cannot proceed he said No president has ever refused to acknowledge it since the US and China established diplomatic relations in the 70s and no US president has ever created such confusionNow we can say that Sino-US_relations can proceed he saidLv Xiang another Sino-US_relations expert_at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said by mentioning at the request of President_Xi in the White_House statement the United_States might want to show that they still have reservations on the issueHowever Lv said the one China policy had been a very important topic in preliminary conversations leading up to the phone_call The precondition of the call was the basic understanding and acceptance of the one-China_policy he saidForeign Ministry_spokesman Lu Kang would not be drawn on the consultations and negotiations leading up to the call saying only that adhering to the one-China principle is theobligation that any American government should fulfill and adding that theunshaken upholding of this policy is very important for the healthy and stable development of bilateral tiesTaiwans presidential spokesman Huang Chung-yen suggested his administration had been warned in advance that Taipei and Washington have been in close contact and communication regarding this development and continue to take an effective zero surprise approachIn recent_days he said the US administration including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson hadon multiple occasions reiterated its support for Taiwan The timing of the phone_call also appeared significant coming on the eve of a formal summit between Trump and Japans Prime_Minister Shinzo_Abe set to take_place in Washington on FridayJapan is a historic enemy of China and a key modern-day strategic rivaland Beijing is sure to be watching that summit extremely closely Trump is likely to use the occasion to reinforce his commitment to the mutual defense pact between United_States and Japan a policy that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis took pains to underline on a visit to Tokyo last weekIn December following his election and before his transition Trump made waves with a protocol-breaking Tsai Ing-wenIt was the first communication between leaders of the United_States and Taiwan since 1979 and the product of months of preparation by Trumps advisers who advocated for a new strategy of engagement with Taiwan to rattle ChinaAs expected China reacted sternly but then Trump publicly questioned whether the one-China_policy was in the United_States best interestsHe fired off provocative tweets about the Chinese on currency manipulation imports from the United_States and its military buildup in the South China SeaIn December Trump suggested he would use Taiwans status as a bargaining chip telling Fox_News I dont_know why we have to be bound by a one-China_policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things including trade In January shortly before his inauguration he that he was open to shifting US policy on China and TaiwanEverything is under negotiation including one-China Trump told saidDespite closing its embassy in Taipei in 1979 the United_States remains Taiwans biggest ally and arms supplier and is bound by legislation to provide the means for the island to defend itselfDefeated nationalist forces fled to the island in 1949 after losing a civil_war to the CommunistsThe White_House said representatives from both countries will engage in discussions and negotiations on various issues of mutual interest The two leaders also extended invitations to meet in their respective countries and look forward to further talks with very successful outcomesThe phone_call to Xi came a day after Trump sent a letter wishing China a prosperous Year of the Rooster sent 11_days after China celebrated its Lunar New Year festival In that letter Trump also said he looked forward to working with Xi todevelop a constructive relationship that benefits both nations the White_House saidOn Wednesday a US Navy P-3C Orion surveillance aircraft was engaged in what the US Pacific Command called an unsafe interaction with a Chinese military KJ-200 aircraft in international airspace over the South China Sea aircraft We will address the issue in appropriate diplomatic and military channels said Pacific Command spokesman Maj Rob Shuford said in a statement Friday Such incidents are not uncommon though and the two nations militaries have improved communications in recent years to make them less common and less threateningTalking to

Department of Agriculture Papadopoulos wrote to campaign_manager Corey_Lewandowski and campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort the newly released documents showThe campaign officials are not identified in court_documents but some of the emails cited by federal_prosecutors match messages described in August to The Washington_Post by people_familiar with their contentsThe newly released documents_show that while senior Trump officials at times rebuffed or ignored Papadopoulos they were well aware of his efforts which went on for months His interactions with them could complicate the White Houses attempts to distance the president from Papadopoulos who pleaded_guilty Oct 5 to lying to federal agents Trump himself knew of Papadopouloss claims that he had a pipeline to Moscow During a March_2016 meeting of the campaigns national_security advisers in Washington that Trump attended Papadopoulos said he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between the then-candidate and PutinOn Monday White_House press_secretary Sarah_Huckabee Sanders said she was not sure that the president recalls specific details of the meeting calling it brief She described Papadopouloss role with the campaign as extremely limitedIn a statement Cloviss attorney Victoria Toensing said Clovis a radio_host from Iowa who was one of Trumps earliest supporters always vigorously opposed any Russian trip for Donald Trump and/or the campaignShe said Clovis was being polite when he encouraged Papadopoulos to meet with Russian officials in August adding that the campaign had a strict rule that no person could travel abroad as a representative of the campaign Clovis could not stop an American citizen from traveling abroad in his personal capacity she saidClovis has been nominated to be the top science

forward to telling all of the details of Georges story at that timeTrump first identified Papadopoulos as one of his advisers describing him as an energy and oil consultant Excellent guy Papadopoulos was charged under seal in July and was arrested when he arrived at Dulles International Airport on July 27 His plea agreement indicates that he is cooperating with special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III He pleaded_guilty in October to lying to federal agents about his contacts with people with connections to the Russian_government filings showPapadopouloss efforts to arrange a meeting with Russian officials began days after he was named to Trumps campaign team and continued for months At one point he emailed Lewandowski to discuss Russias interest in hosting Mr Trump Have been receiving a lot of calls over the last_month about Putin wanting to host him and the team when the time is right according to documentsA month later he in an email to ManafortIn response Manafort forwarded Papadopouloss offer to his deputy_Rick Gates writing We_need someone to communicate that [Trump] is not doing these trips It should be someone low_level in the campaign so as not to send any signalManafort spokesman Jason Maloni told The_Post in August that the campaign chairmans response indicated that any invitation by Russia directly or indirectly would be rejected outright Papadopouloss proposed trip ultimately did_not take_place court_documents show According to court_papers Papadopoulos lied to federal agents about one of his key contacts a London-based professor he met in Italy in March_2016 days after he joined the Trump campaignIn a subsequent meeting in April the professor told Papadopoulos that the Russian_government had dirt on Democratic presidential_candidate Hillary_Clinton including thousands of Clintons emailsThat conversation occurred weeks before the Democratic_National Committee revealed that it had been hacked and believed that Russians were behind the attack It also came about a month after an email account belonging to Clintons campaign_chairman John_Podesta was targeted with a phishing attempt that may have led to the hack of his emails by WikiLeaks in October 2016One email quoted in court_filings regarding the professor matches an exchange previously described to The_Post in which Papadopoulos identified the professor as Joseph Mifsud the director of the London Academy of DiplomacyThat document as well as emails with Clovis and other top campaign aides was among more_than 20000 pages that the Trump campaign turned over to congressional_committees after review by White_House and defense lawyersMifsud told The_Post in an email in August that he had absolutely no contact with the Russian_government and said his only ties to Russia were through academic links He did_not respond to a request for comment MondayWhen asked about the unsealed indictments Monday Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said We dont_know what the charges are After being sent a copy of the indictments he responded My office hours are overPapadopoulos also communicated with a Russian woman with ties to the government and a man in Moscow he believed was connected to the Ministry of Foreign_Affairs filings showAt the time Papadopoulos incorrectly believed that the Russian woman was a niece of Putin according to court documentsWe are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr Trump she wrote to him in April_2016 The Russian Federation would love to welcome him once his candidature would be officially announced According to court_filings she told Papadopoulos that she would like to help set_up meetings with her associates to discuss US-Russia ties under a future President TrumpAfter Papadopoulos_emailed campaign officials about her offer Clovis responded that he would work it through the campaign but added Great workToensing described Clovis as a polite gentleman from Iowa who would always have been courteous to a person offering to help the campaignClovis played a key role in boosting Trump during the Iowa caucuses but his influence within the campaign subsequently waned amid tense relations with Trumps son-in-law and adviser Jared KushnerDuring a Jan 27 2017 interview with FBI agents Papadopoulos said he had met the Russian woman before he joined the Trump campaign and falsely stated that he had no relationship with her according to court filingsThe day after his second interview with FBI agents in February Papadopoulos deactivated his Facebook account which had information about his outreach to Russian officials a move prosecutors said was aimed_at obstructing their investigationPapadopoulos who has a scant foreign_policy background briefly advised the 2016_presidential campaign of neurosurgeon Ben CarsonWhen Trump identified Papadopoulos as an adviser in March_2016 the hotel and real_estate executive was rising in the field of Republican presidential candidates and his campaign was eager to show that it had credible voices offering advice on foreign_policy Among the other advisers he named that day was whose ties to Russia have been under_scrutiny Throughout the summer Papadopoulos met with foreign officials and gave interviews to media in other countries sometimes describing Trumps views on Putin or RussiaHe told a group of researchers in Israel that Trump saw Putin as a responsible actor and potential partner according to a column in the Jerusalem Post later he met with a British Foreign Office representative in London and a Greek official in New_York British and Greek embassy spokesmen have said He also criticized US sanctions on Russia in an interview with the Russian news outlet InterfaxThe Post has also reported that contained in a dossier about Trumps ties to Russia told people around him that he was in contact with Papadopoulos during the campaign Robert Costa Carol D Leonnig and Philip Rucker in Washington Karla_Adam in London and David_Filipov in Moscow contributed to this reportThree days after Donald Trump named his campaign foreign_policy team in March_2016 the youngest of the new advisers sent an email to seven campaign officials with the subject line Meeting with Russian Leadership - Including PutinThe adviser offered to set_up a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss US-Russia ties under President Trump telling them his Russian contacts welcomed the opportunityaccording to internal campaign emails read to The Washington PostThe proposal sent a ripple of concern through campaign headquarters in Trump_Tower Campaign co-chairman Sam_Clovis wrote that he thought NATO_allies should be consulted before any plans were made Another Trump adviser retired Navy Rear Adm Charles Kubic cited legal concerns including a possible violation of US sanctions against Russia and of the Logan Act which prohibits US citizens from unauthorized negotiation with foreign governmentsBut Papadopoulos a campaign volunteer with scant foreign_policy experience persisted Between March and September the self-described energy consultant sent at_least a half-dozen requests for Trump as he turned from primary candidate to party nominee or for members of his team to meet with Russian officials Among those to express concern about the effort was then-campaign chairman_Paul Manafort who rejected in May 2016 a proposal from Papadopoulos for Trump to do soThe exchanges are among more_than 20000 pages of documents the Trump campaign turned over to congressional_committees this month after review by White_House and defense lawyers The selection of Papadopouloss emails were read to The_Post by a person with access to them Two other people with access to the emails confirmed the general tone of the exchanges and some specific passages within them Papadopoulos emerges from the sample of emails as a new and puzzling figure in the examination of the Trump campaigns contacts with Russian officials and their proxies during the 2016 election now the subject of a special-counsel investigationLess than a decade out of college Papadopoulos appeared to hold little sway within the campaign and it is unclear_whether he was acting as an intermediary for the Russian_government although he told campaign officials he wasWhile the emails illustrate his eagerness to strengthen the campaigns connections to the Russian_government Papadopoulos does_not spell out in them why it would be in Trumps interest to do so His entreaties appear to have generated more concern than excitement within the campaign which at the time was looking to seal the Republican nomination and take on a heavily favored Hillary_Clinton in the general electionBut the internal resistance to Papadopouloss requests is at odds with other overtures Trump allies were making toward Russia at the time mostly at a more senior level of the campaignThree months after Papadopoulos raised the possibility of a meeting between Trump and Russian President_Vladimir Putin the presidents son Donald Trump Jr and son-in-law Jared_Kushner met with a delegation led by a Russian lawyer offering to provide damaging_information on Clinton attended that Trump_Tower session in June_2016 a meeting now under_scrutiny in the special_counsels collusion inquiry But the new emails reveal that Manafort had rejected a request from Papadopoulos just the previous month to set_up a meeting between Trump and Russian officialsIn July 2016 and again two months later Jeff_Sessions then a senator and senior foreign_policy adviser to Trump And also in July a few weeks after Papadopoulos asked his superiors whether other campaign advisers or aides could accept some of the Russians invitations Carter_Page another foreign_policy adviser spoke at a Russian university in Moscow Page said he made the trip independently of the campaignTo experts in Russian intelligence gathering the Papadopoulos chain offers further evidence that Russians were looking for entry points and playing upon connections with lower-level aides to penetrate the 2016 campaignFormer CIA_director John Brennan in May told the House_Intelligence Committee that he had seen worrisome evidence of contacts and interactions between Russian officials and the Trump campaign although he offered no specificsSteven L Hall who retired from the CIA in 2015 after 30_years of managing the agencys Russia operations said when told by The_Post about the emails The bottom line is that theres no doubt in my mind that the Russian_government was casting a wide net when they were looking at the American election I_think they were doing very basic intelligence work Whos out there Whos willing to play ball And how can we use themPapadopoulos a former intern and researcher at the conservative Hudson Institute was on a list of campaign volunteers that Trump announced as his foreign_policy advisory team during Trump called Papadopoulos an excellent guy Almost immediately Papadopoulos came under_scrutiny for his lack of experience He graduated from college in 2009 and his LinkedIn profile cited his participation in a Model UN program for students among his qualifications Papadopoulos did_not respond to repeated requests for comment Page who has been the subject of a foreign surveillance warrant over his connections to Russia said the Papadopoulos email exchange was another sign that the Russia communications were inconsequentialThe entirely benign offer from a volunteer member of the Trump movement is infinitely less relevant than the real collusion in the 2016 election said Page who was copied on the first Papadopoulos email communication in March Page said in an email exchange Saturday that the real scandal lies among Clinton and Obama associates who fed false evidence to investigators that he said formed the basis of the federal warrant concerning him Papadopoulos made more_than a half-dozen overtures on behalf of Russians or people with Russia contacts whom he claimed to knowOn March 24 Clovis the campaign co-chairman who also served on the foreign_policy team reacted to one proposed Russia meeting by writing We thought we probably should not go forward with any meeting with the Russians until we have had occasion to sit with our NATO alliesIn the same email chain Kubic the retired admiral reminded others about legal restrictions on meetings with certain Russian officials adding Just want to make_sure that no one on the team outruns their headlights and embarrasses the campaignUndeterred Papadopoulos alerted then-campaign manager_Corey Lewandowski in an April email that he was receiving a lot of calls over the past month about arranging a Russia meetingPutin wants to host the Trump team when the time is right he wrote on April 27 On May 4 Papadopoulos forwarded Lewandowski and others a note he received from the program head for the government-funded Russian International_Affairs Council In it Ivan Timofeev a senior official in the organization reached out to report that Russian foreign ministry officials were open to a Trump visit to Moscow and requested that the campaign and Russians write a formal letter outlining the meeting Clovis responded to the Timofeev invitation by noting There are legal issues we need to mitigate meeting with foreign officials as a private citizenThe email chain does_not show a response from Lewandowski who did_not return calls seeking commentSeveral weeks later Papadopoulos forwarded the same message from Timofeev to Manafort the newly named campaign chairmanRussia has been eager to meet with Mr Trump for some time and have been reaching out to me to discuss the adviser told ManafortManafort reacted coolly forwarding the email to his associate Rick_Gates with a note We_need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these tripsGates agreed and told Manafort he would ask the campaigns correspondence coordinator to handle it the person responding to all mail of non-importance to signify this did_not need a senior official to respond A spokesman for Manafort whose Virginia home was raided by FBI agents three weeks ago as part of an investigation by special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III said the email chain provides concrete evidence that the Russia collusion narrative is fake newsMr Manaforts swift action reflects the attitude of the campaign any invitation by Russia directly or indirectly would be rejected outright Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni said in a statementIn an email to The_Post Timofeev confirmed that his organization had discussed a meeting with the Trump campaign in the spring of 2016The Russian International_Affairs Council was created in 2010 by a decree of then-President Dmitry Medvedev as a project of various Russian_government agencies It is led by former foreign_minister Igor Ivanov Its board includes Russias current foreign_minister Sergei Lavrov as well as top Russian scholars and business leaders among them the chairman of Alfa-Bank and Sberbank two of Russias largest banksWe discussed the idea informally as one of the opportunities for dialogue between Russia and the US Timofeev said in the email RIAC often hosts meetings with prominent political figures and experts from the US and many other countriesHe said the group would have been open to meeting with other campaignsClinton spokesman Nick Merrill said officials with the Democrats campaign have no recollections or record of having been contacted by the group Similarly an adviser to Barack_Obamas first

substantive information available to me that doesnt raise as many questions as it does answers Clovis said in the interview So Im a skepticThis position represents a departure from the scientific consensus In its most recent report theUN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changethat it is extremely likely that since the 1950s humans and their greenhouse gas emissions have been the dominant cause of the planets warming trendNeither USDA nor Clovis responded to inquiries earlier_this week about the prospect of his appointment and his views on climate scienceClovis who started at USDA as a senior White_House adviser just after Trump was inaugurated possesses a BS in political science an MBA degree and a doctorate in public administration according to the White_House The post for which he is being nominated the Agriculture Departments undersecretary for research_education and economics has by a string of individuals with advanced degrees in science or medicineThe overall portfolio

Obama_administration the Agriculture Department had elevated the issue of climate_change seeking to curb agricultural emissions as well as help farmers adapt to changing conditions by creating regional across the United_States Then-Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack sought to enlist farmers ranchers and forest owners in the effort to capture and store carbon nationwide Since Trump took_office the agency has shifted the description of some of these efforts On Wednesday for example the departmentsNational Institute of Food and Agriculture announced nine grants totaling more_than $8 million to study and develop new approaches for the agriculture sector to adapt to and mitigate the effects of changing environmental conditions But the same press release noted that four of them

ownership of his company while shifting assets into a trust managed by his sons a step that Trump and his advisers said will eliminate potential conflicts of interest between his public duties and private businessThe move announced Wednesday in Trumps first news_conference since July followed weeks of criticism from ethics_experts and congressional Democrats who have said his financial entanglements could improperly steer his presidential decision-makingThe announcement included a pledge from a Trump lawyer that the company would make no new foreign deals whatsoever during Trumps presidency and that any new domestic deals would undergo vigorous review including approval by an independent ethics adviserIn addition Trump is giving up his position as an officer at the company the Trump Organization ceding all management responsibilities and agreeing to what his lawyers described as strict limits on communications with company executives beyond receiving regular profit-and-loss statementsSheri Dillon a tax adviser at global law_firm Morgan Lewis said Trump has sought to isolate himself from the business that will be managed by Trumps sons Donald Jr and Eric and company executive Allen WeisselbergTrump she said will only know of a deal if he sees it in the paper or on TV She added that Trump also terminated all pending international dealsBut Trumps continued financial stake in a global real_estate and branding company is likely to remain a point of contention between the president-elect and federal ethics officials who have said that full divestiture remains the only way to prevent conflictsDillon who also wrote a widely shared letter last_year that asserted Trumps tax_returns were under audit argued that taking steps recommended by some vocal ethics_experts would trigger additional problems A sell-off would have created additional conflicts she said while a blind trust would have been unrealistic for a real_estate company with high-profile assetsPresident Trump cant unknow he owns Trump_Tower Dillon said and he should not be expected to destroy the company he builtThe announcement inspired an unusual and highly critical response from the top federal official at the agency that works closely with presidential transition teams to ensure they abide by ethics requirementsWalter Shaub director of the Office of Government Ethics took the stage at a Wednesday event for the Brookings Institution think_tank to say that Trumps decision doesnt meet the standards that every president of the past four decades has metShaub appointed by President_Obama in 2013 said the trust adds nothing to the equation because its not even close to a blind trust and called other Trump provisions wholly inadequateShaub whose agency administers financial disclosure filings and advises executive branch officials on avoiding conflicts of interest does_not have the power to force Trumps hand The director said he spoke out in hopes the president-elect would fully divestSome ethics_experts also expressed alarm Wednesday that the changes leave plenty of room for foreign interests and others to enrich the president and affect US policyRichard Painter who was ethics counsel in the George_W Bush White_House said the setup will not prevent Trump from knowing his business sources of revenue or block him from receiving income from the trust Trump_Tower projects still stand for instance in the Philippines Turkey Uruguay and other hot spots where foreign buyers or governments could still lavish money on the Trump brandHe still has businesses all over the world and we still do not know who is financing those businesses and who hes indebted to Painter saidReferring to the yet-unnamed expert who would be hired to sign off on new deals Painter added That ethics adviser is going to have a lot of work to do Sounds like hell need air supportTrump also retained his ownership share of the luxury hotel he opened last_year in the Old Post Office Pavilion down the street from the White_House despite criticism that foreign leaders might try to curry favor with the administration by doing business there and at his other hotels possibly violating the Constitutions emoluments clauseThe clause has never been tested in the courts but it is upheld by threat of impeachment and some scholars say Trump risks violating it the day hes sworn into office The Washington hotel of which Trump owns 76percent has been frequented by foreign diplomats since the election Trump himself has signed for hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate loans from foreign banks and is currently involved in deals with foreign investors across several continentsDillon Trumps attorney dismissed the suggestion of a problem saying the clause would not apply to arms-length transactions the president-elect has nothing to do with such as hotel stays for foreign diplomatsNevertheless Dillon said the hotel would donate all profits from foreign government payments from the Trump International Hotel to the US TreasuryIn his news_conference Wednesday at Trump_Tower in Manhattan Trump showcased his signature theatrics He stood by several stacks of what he said were legal papers related to the Trump Organization changes He noted repeatedly that the president is not covered by any conflict-of-interest laws and that he was sure he could do a good job leading both the company and the country if he so choseI could actually run my business and run government at the same_time he said But he added later I dont_want to take advantage of something I have something that others dont haveAnd if his sons do a bad job Trump added he will tell them his catchphrase from The Apprentice Youre firedTrump said his commitment to focus on the presidency has already cost him business adding he had in recent_days turned down $2billion to do a number of deals in Dubai with Hussain Sajwani the billionaire chairman of the Damac Properties development firm and a man Trump has called a friendA Damac executive said the company confirms that the discussions took_place as stated in the media briefing but the proposals were declined by the Trump Organization and that the proposals were for a variety of different property dealsTrumps plan will also include tapping a chief compliance counsel at the Trump Organization who will monitor the Trump businesses for any actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency Dillon saidNeither Trump nor Dillon said who would fill the position and requests to speak with company representatives were not immediately returnedThe Trump Organization is a vast worldwide collection of golf courses hotels condo towers and other commercial holdings spread across more_than 500 business_interests financial filings showMuch of the companys revenue stems from deals with real_estate developers and merchandisers who pay the company millions of dollars to use Trumps name and imagePresidents are exempt from conflict-of-interest laws that force virtually all other executive-branch officials to sell off their business_interests as well as recuse themselves from public decision-making that could benefit their private finances The president must still abide by bribery fraud and corruption laws that could arise from potential financial conflictsModern presidents have followed a tradition of selling potentially problematic assets or sequestering them into a blind trust overseen by an independent manager with unassailable controlThe trust agreement outlined Wednesday will not be truly blind critics said due to Trumps family relationship to its leaders his sonsTrumps daughter Ivanka will also step down from management of the Trump Organization and her name-brand fashion jewelry and licensing companies lawyers said She will also restructure her involvement in potentially profitable Trump Organization deals and instead receive fixed payments from the revenue of what lawyers called a diversified pool of unidentified projectsFixed-income agreements are common approaches to addressing conflicts for spouses of those stepping into government But like her father Ivanka Trump has not committed to selling off her ownership stake leaving one of her largest conflicts unresolvedIvanka Trumps husband Jared_Kushner who Trump will name as a White_House adviser will sell off much of his New_York real_estate and media fortune and resign from the family business to avoid conflicts his lawyers said this weekMany questions remain Trump has not released his income tax_returns which would give the most precise look yet at Trumps holdings business_interests and foreign accounts Trump has blamed several years of Internal Revenue Service audits among other factors for his reluctance to release the returns Presidents by law are audited every year and not required to release their returns Trumps sons too have already run into the minefield of potential conflicts awaiting the presidents family Eric Trump said recently that he will leave his foundation following worries that donors could receive special access or favors from the Trump administrationCongressional Democrats on Monday introduced a law that would force Trump and future presidents to divest their business_interests and other potential conflicts But their Republican counterparts have largely stayed silent on Trumps entanglements or said they trust his judgment drawing the laws success into question Jonathan OConnell contributed to this reportClose observers of the 2016 election will remember that on occasion President Trump liked to draw attention to his opponents security practices as a way of criticism There was you may recall something about an email serverHillary Clinton sent classified information even during her travels overseas jeopardizing the national_security of the American people by allowing her emails to be hacked by foreign intelligence services Trumps campaign declared But it wasnt just Clinton who was the target of his criticism The Democratic_National Committee got hacked because it didnt have a very strong defense_system against hacking the way the Republicans did (as he said during a cybersecurity session on Jan 31) The government was hacked by China because were run by people that dont_know what theyre doing (as said in his Jan 11 news conference) Trump the idea went would not be so naive on the critical subject of national securityPerhaps its harder than it looksSunday night CNN details of the moment that Trump joined by Japanese_Prime Minister_Shinzo Abe learned about a missile_launch in North_Korea Trump and Abe were enjoying dinner at Trumps exclusive Mar-a-Lago_Club in Florida at the time but CNN reported began to discuss the details of this international incident right there at their table As Mar-a-Lagos wealthy members looked on from their tables and with a keyboard player crooning in the background CNNs Kevin Liptak reported Trump and Abes evening meal quickly morphed into a strategy session the decision-making on full view to fellow diners who described it in detail to CNNEarlier in the week Trump had been criticized for leaving intelligence documents vulnerable to people without security clearance Sen Martin Heinrich (D-NM) noticed that the president kept the key in a secured bag while hosting people in the Oval_Office which is a bit like leaving your house keys in your front door while youre having a party in your backyard Theres no indication that anyone saw anything confidential in this incident but this Heinrich suggested was Classified 101Never leave a key in a classified lockbag in the presence of non-cleared people (Original Photo ) Martin Heinrich (@MartinHeinrich) Compared to holding a national_security conversation over dinner in the public dining room at his private club though the lockbag incident palesIts not clear that anyone heard particulars of the conversation but other diners certainly noticed Richard DeAgazio was in the room and posted photos of the moment to FacebookOthers who were there added their thoughts in the comments beneath the post One wrote that he was watching very close by Had no idea what it was about Thats probably not the case for the waiters who CNN reports cleared the wedge salads and brought along the main course as Trump and Abe continued consulting with aidesNotice though that the photos appear to corroborate an important detail from the CNN report The patio was lit only with candles and moonlight so aides used the camera lights on their phones to help the stone-faced Trump and Abe read through the documents Liptak writes In DeAgazios first photo you can see a phone flashlight being used in that wayWhy is this important Mobile phones have flashlights yes and cameras microphones and Internet connectivity When Edward Snowden was meeting with reporters in Hong Kong at the moment he was leaking the material hed stolen from the NSA he famously asked that they blocking any radio signals in the event that the visitors phones had been hacked This was considered the most secure way of ensuring that the phones couldnt be used as wiretaps even more secure than removing the battery Phones especially phones with their flashes turned on for improved visibility are portable television satellite trucks and if compromised can be used to get a great deal of information about whats_happening nearby unless precautions are taken Precautions werent taken One of DeAgazios photos shows Trump using a phone at the table within view of other diners (and while sitting next to a foreign leader) Its not clear what phone Trump is using in that picture but its known that he uses a relatively old Android device even while serving as president As we Trump generally uses that device when hes not in the middle of a work day Shortly before the dinner with Abe he tweeted from itA working dinner tonight with Prime_Minister Abe of Japan and his representatives at the Winter White_House (Mar-a-Lago) Very good talks Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) The problem is that Trumps Android phone would be very simple to hack to provide precisely the sort of access described above NPR the question of how secure that phone might be and Berkeley computer scientist Nicholas Weaver was bluntDonald Trump for the longest time has been using a insecure Android phone that by all reports is so easy to compromise it would not meet the security requirements of a teenager Weaver told NPR and while he couldnt say for sure we must assume that his phone has actively been compromised for a while and an actively compromised phone is literally a listening deviceThats just one of the phones that may have been at the table for the conversationThe picture thats painted is one that runs contrary to the arguments Trump made on the campaign_trail While running for the presidency cybersecurity and the risk of compromise were cardinal sins necessitating that he be given the most_powerful position in America Now that hes attained that position though his attitude toward security seems a bit more laxSpicer also said with Mar A Lago this weekend President was briefed in a SCIF and dinner discussion was just logistics over a presser Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs)Debate intensified in President Trumps political circle Tuesday over how aggressively to confront special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_III dividing some of the presidents advisers and loyalists as the Russia investigation enters a new phase following charges_against three former Trump campaign officialsDespite his with a he has roundly dismissed Trump has been cooperating with Mueller and lately has resisted attacking him directly at the inside and outside the White HouseBut several prominent Trump allies including former White_House chief_strategist Stephen_K Bannon have said they think the presidents posture is too timid Seeing the investigation as a political threat they are clamoring for a more combative approach to Mueller that would damage his credibility and effectively kneecap his operation by cutting its fundingStill Bannon and others are not advising Trump to fire Mueller a rash move that the presidents lawyers and political advisers oppose and insist is not under considerationBannon in recent_days has spoken with Trump by phone to relay his concerns about the presidents position and to counsel a shift in strategy according to three people with knowledge of the conversation The president so_far has not accepted Bannons advice these people saidBannons view has been amplified elsewhere on the right with talk_radio and cable news commentators speaking out more forcefully against Mueller and his expanding probe The Wall_Street Journal has called on Mueller to resign The Journal is part of News Corp which is led by Rupert Murdoch a friend of Trump who speaks privately with the presidentBut many people in Trumps orbit recommend that he stay the course with cooperation encouraging him to harshly criticize media coverage of the investigation but avoid engaging MuellerI like Steve but his advice is not always the most helpful said Christopher Ruddy a Trump friend and the chief_executive of Newsmax a conservative media outlet In this case whatever Steve says the president should do the opposite The where Republican lawmakers have mostly split into two camps those who are wary of weighing in on Muellers_investigation and those who see it as a prime political targetBannon is demanding that GOP leaders move swiftly to end congressional probes into Russian_interference undermine Muellers_investigation and increase scrutiny on Democratic controversiesThe Republicans are like church mice Bannon said Tuesday No support of the president Totally gutless The Hill needs to step upSenate Judiciary_Committee Chairman Charles E Grassley (R-Iowa) said he believes that Republicans should proceed carefully and he called Mueller a very ethical personI dont_know how you could improve things by interfering Grassley said The process just ought to goHouse Intelligence_Committee Chairman Devin_Nunes (R-Calif) a trusted Trump ally has launched an investigation_into and is preparing to invite witnesses this week to testify about the FBIs handling of Russia investigations Nunes intends to issue subpoenas if people decline to appear according to people briefed on his plansFormer House speaker Newt Gingrich an informal Trump adviser who praised Mueller earlier_this year after his appointment as special_counsel said he has slowly soured on the former FBI_director and agrees that Congress should put a harsher national spotlight on himMueller ought to be held accountable Gingrich saidHe ticked through a series of what he considers questionable moves by Mueller and his team including their handling of former Trump foreign_policy adviser whom the government described in an indictment unsealed_Monday as a proactive cooperatorCongress should look seriously at whether Mueller put a wire on this guy and sent him around to entrap people Gingrich said If that happened Congress better see the full transcripts not just the FBIs edited versions Congress should also ask why theyre [former campaign_chairman Paul] Manaforts home at 5 am for a white-collar crime from a few years agoThis sentiment is not heard at the White_House however where officials have been careful not to antagonize the special counselOur approach has been to be cooperative and responsive and to see this come to a quick conclusion White_House press_secretary Sarah_Huckabee Sanders said Have we been aggressive in our comments and our feelings towards the Clinton campaign and the DNC Yes But thats where our aggression is seen and nowhere elseTy Cobb the White_House lawyer overseeing Russia matters said after Mondays indictments of Manafort and his longtime deputy_Rick Gates Nothing about todays events alters anything related to our engagement with the special_counsel with whom we continue to cooperateCobb added There are no discussions and there is no consideration being given to terminating MuellerRepublicans in Congress said Trump is wise to avoid messing with MuellerThere would be an uprising at the Capitol like never seen before if any kind of interference looked like it was taking place said Sen Bob Corker (R-Tenn) Regardless of which side of the aisle Thats just beyond the pale Among Republicans there is broad agreement to bring attention to past controversies involving Hillary_Clinton Trumps Democratic opponent in the 2016 election that have animated hourly discussions on Fox_News Channel and conservative talk_radio programsThe White_House and allies have waged a public relations battle over the Clinton campaigns and the Democratic_National Committees that resulted in the famous dossier that details Trumps alleged connections to RussiaThe dossier has become a lightning rod with congressional Republican leaders trying to discredit Fusion_GPS the firm that commissioned the dossier and the documents author Christopher_Steele a former_British intelligence_officer with ties to the US intelligence communityRepublicans also are trying to bring scrutiny to while Clinton was secretary of state The deal which Trump used as a political cudgel against Clinton during the campaign allowed a Russian nuclear energy agency to acquire a controlling stake in a Canadian-based company that had mining licenses for about 20_percent of US uranium_extraction capacity although the company cannot export uraniumFox News Channel host Sean Hannity a Trump confidant decried the lack of investigative attention on Clinton a point the president and his top aides have made in recent daysThis is not hyperbole Hannity said Monday_night in his which the president is known to watch regularly I am not overstating the case We are at a major crisis point in America tonight Do we have equal justice under the law in this country todaySome Republican lawmakers have heeded these calls House and Senate GOP leaders have announced two investigations into the uranium_deal while at_least three congressional_committees are continuing to look into how the FBI handled Clintons email scandalBut there appears to be little appetite for legislation that would cut Muellers funding or otherwise limit the scope of his investigation something various Trump allies have suggested is necessaryMy basic philosophy is once you have an independent counsel you ought to give him a chance to follow the facts said Sen Richard C Shelby (R-Ala) a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the chairman of the subcommittee that handles the Justice Departments funding If somebodys doing a job you dont_want to cut it offSen Susan Collins (R-Maine) said The idea that Bob Mueller is going to have the scope of his inquiry constrained or be otherwise restricted is really out there I_think thats extremely unlikely Karoun Demirjian and Sean Sullivan contributed to this reportPresident Trump on Thursday aired his grievances against the news media the intelligence_community and his detractors generally in a sprawling stream-of-consciousness news_conference that alternated between claims that he had inherited a mess and the assertion that his fledgling administration is running like a fine-tuned machineTo be honest I inherited a mess Trump said in a news_conference that lasted more thanan hour and was at times rambling combative and pointed Its a mess At home and abroad a mess Jobs are pouring out of the countryYet moments later the president seemed to acknowledge the widespread reports of turbulence and upheaval emanating out of his West_Wing only to claim that his White_House which so_far has been marred by staff infighting a controversial travel_ban false_statements and myriad leaks was operating seamlesslyI turn on the TV open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos chaos he said Yet it is the exact opposite This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine despite the fact that I cant get my Cabinet approvedAsked about recent reports that Mike Flynn his former national_security adviser who resigned Monday evening had improperly discussed Russian sanctions with the Russian_ambassador to the United_States before Trump was sworn in the president defended Flynn as a fine person saying he had done nothing wrong in engaging the Russian envoyBut Trump said Flynn had erred by misleading government officials including Vice_President Pence about his conversations which is why the president ultimately demanded his resignationHe didnt tell the vice_president of the United_States the facts Trump said And then he didnt remember And that just wasnt acceptable to meTrump made clear he had no problem with Flynn discussing the sanctions_imposed on Moscow by the Obama_administration with the Russian_ambassador even if he was not directly toldto do so by Trump saying it was Flynnsjob to reach out to foreign officialsNo I didnt direct him but I would have directed him if he didnt do it he saidTrump was asked several times about whether his campaign had contact with Russia and grew testy as reporters pushed him for a yes-or-no answerHe said he certainly hadnt and that he was not aware of such contacts during the campaignI can tell_you speaking for myself I own nothing in Russia Trump said I have no loans in Russia I dont have any deals in Russia President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election He then called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration which was terrific But so did many other leaders almost all other leaders from almost all of the countries So thats the extentTrump also used the questions to press his case that the United_States would be well-served by a better relationship with Russia and to mock his Democratic opponent Hillary_Clinton for her efforts to reset the relationship between the two_countries while she was secretary of stateTrump derisively referred to that stupid plastic button that made us all look like jerks a reference to the red reset button that Clinton presented to the Russian foreign_minister early in the Obama administrationThe news_conference was ostensibly billed as a chance for Trump to announce his new pick to head the Labor Department Alexander Acosta who would be the first Latino in Trumps Cabinet after Andrew Puzder his original choice withdrew from consideration Wednesday amid mounting opposition on Capitol_Hill But for onehour and 17 minutes the president offered the verbal equivalent of the brash and impetuous early morning tweets that have become the alarm clock for much of Washington taking aim at everything from illegal immigrant violence to the criminal leaks within his intelligence communityTrump said he would use his remarks to bypass the dishonest media and speak directly to the American people about the incredible progress his administration has madeThe media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges we made and theyre not happy about it for whatever reason he saidThough the president began on a subdued almost melancholy note looking down repeatedly to read from prepared remarks on his lectern he became more fiery and animated joyful even when he began to banter and joust with the assembled reporters At times he seemed to reprise some of his favorite themes from the campaign_trail complaining about Clinton and criticizing President_Barack Obamas policies from his Affordable_Care Act to his failed reset with RussiaTrump repeatedly lambasted the fake_news media which at one point he upgraded (or downgraded) to the very fake_news media while promoting some dubious claims and fake_news of his ownPressed on his incorrect assertion that he had the largest margin of victory in the electoral college since President Ronald_Reagan Trump blamed faulty factsI was given that information he said Well I dont_know I was given that informationOn a substantive note Trump said his administration would submit a replacement plan for the Affordable_Care Act in early to mid-March and should have a tax reform package around the same timeTax reform is going to happen fairly quickly Trump said Were doing Obamacare Were in final stagesDuring the news_conference Trump alternated between showering the media with scorn and taking a more playful toneAt one point he insisted he was enjoying himself Im not ranting and raving I love this he said Im having a good time doing thisTrumps Thursday performance seemed an acknowledgment by the president that he may be his own best press_secretary and adviser and allowed him to appear both confident and comfortable While many of his comments as well as the sometimes disjointed nature of his delivery are certain to alarm official Washington they are also the sorts of red-meat talking_points that delighted his base during the campaign and helped propel him to victoryI won with news conferences and probably speeches he told the assembled reporters I certainly didnt win by people listening to you peoplePresident Trumpsought Monday to distance himself from the federal money-laundering charges againsttwo of his top campaign aidesPaul Manafort and Rick_Gates by saying their alleged conspiracy occurred years_ago and asserting that there is NO COLLUSIONThe first White_House comment aboutMondays 12-count_indictment came in a pair of tweets from the president who continued his days-long drum beatto ratchet up pressure on his former foe Hillary_Clinton and the DemocratsTrump tweeted Sorry but this is years_ago before Paul_Manafort was part of the Trump campaign But why arent Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focusIn a second tweet sent three minutes later Trump wrote Also there is NO COLLUSIONSorry but this is years_ago before Paul_Manafort was part of the Trump campaign But why arent Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Also there is NO COLLUSION Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) While the charges did_not reference Manafort and Gatess work on the Trump campaignseparate court_documents unsealed Mondaydetailed connections betweenthe Trump campaign and the Russian_government Those documents_show that George_Papadopoulos a foreign_policy adviser to Trumps campaign pleaded_guilty tomaking a false_statement tothe FBI about his contacts with a foreign professor connected to Russian officialsManafort who served_as Trumps campaign_chairman for several months in mid-2016 and Gates who was Manaforts top deputy on the campaign were longtime business partners and were charged Monday with conspiracy to launder money making false_statements and other counts stemming from special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_IIIs investigation_into Russias influence in the 2016 election and possible_coordination with the Trump campaign The chargesagainst Manafort and Gates focused on their years of lucrative work advising foreign governments and political parties including a party in Ukraine closely aligned with Russian President_Vladimir PutinOver the weekend as Washington braced for the first batch of indictments from Muellers_investigation Trump sought to shift attention from his campaign and associates to his former opponent Clinton In Twitter outbursts amplified by Trump allies the president said the Mueller probe was unfair and demanded that investigations be launched into various Clinton controversies There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton and now the facts are pouring out DO SOMETHING Trump wrote in one tweetLater in the morning Trump added All of this Russia talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts & Reform Is this coincidental NOTDonald Trumps adult sons who are overseeing a nationwide expansion of the family business during their fathers presidency are envisioning ways that their experiences from the campaign_trail can help them establish a footing in dozens of new marketsThe idea is to move beyond a focus on luxury hotels in big metropolises and build boutique properties in a broader mix of cities including some the Trump brothers came to know well during more_than a year of intensive travel fundraising and grass-roots networking on the road to the White HouseI got to see a lot of those markets on the campaign Donald Trump Jr the presidents eldest son told The Washington_Post in a recent interview from his office on the 25th floor of Trump_Tower I_think Ive probably been in all of them over the last 18 monthsThe initial plan is tied to the Trumps previously announced new chain Scion which is being designed as a less-corporate feeling brand of high-end hotels with a more affordable per-room price point than the Trumps five-star properties As with many existing Trump-branded property deals the developers would own the hotels while the Trumps would be paid licensing and management feesThe company says it has signed at_least 17 letters of intent with potential developers It is targeting an array of cities such as Austin Dallas St Louis Nashville and Seattle and Trump Jr said the campaign proved useful in forging relationships with potential new connectionsI met people along the way that would be awesome partners he saidThe expansion plan illustrates how President Trumps political rise has the potential to affect his business even as he and his sons promise to adhere to a strict ethical boundary between the companys moves and the Trump administration And it shows the inherent challenge in separating the familys political work from its corporate interests with upsides and potential problemsExtending the Trump business into a greater cluster of American cities could bring political benefits for a president who has vowed to bring jobs and economic prosperity to struggling communities But it also comes as Trump has faced criticism from Democrats and ethics officials for his decision to retain his ownership stake in the company a decision that means he stands to personally benefit from its growthBuilding new hotels for example could create issues tax disputes allegations of labor violations or environmental violations that require federal departments to consider cases that could directly impact the presidents finances And while the Trumps have vowed to sign no new foreign deals pursuing a raft of new domestic contracts from coast to coast means the Trumps are likely to engage in negotiations with private developers banks and investors who see additional benefits in doing business with the presidents companyIts just going to add fuel to the fire that is already burning with him having still a foot in both the boardroom and one in the Oval_Office said Scott Amey the general counsel of the nonpartisan watchdog group Project on Government OversightThe White_House did_not respond to a request for comment The president in January added a team of ethics lawyers to the White_House Counsels Office while the company hired a longtime Republican attorney tasked with ensuring the Trump Organization minimizes conflicts of interestIn interviews the Trump sons waved off the idea that their plans created any potential ethical problemsThere are lines that we would never cross and thats mixing business with anything government Eric Trump saidDonald Trump Jr said that since the inauguration he has spoken with his father twice on the phone and once in person when he and his brother attended the announcement of their fathers Supreme_Court nominee Neil Gorsuch Eric Trump said he may ask his father how things are in the White_House but would never discuss government or business affairsWill we ever talk about tax policy Will I ever ask for anything that could otherwise benefit the business Absolutely emphatically not Eric Trump said He has no need to know what were doing and I certainly dont need to know what theyre doing and I dont_want toThe Trumps point man on the expansion is Eric Danziger an experienced executive who was hired in 2015 after previously overseeing expansions at Carlson Hotels Worldwide Starwood Hotels and the former Wyndham InternationalOne of the first Scion projects is slated to open in Dallas where a Turkish-born developer aims to open a sleek glass six-story hotel as part of a $50million mixed-use downtown development The Austin Cincinnati Denver Detroit Nashville Seattle and St Louis areas are also possible targets according to reports by Bloomberg News and business trade publicationsThe Trumps declined to say what other cities they were exploring for projects but said they were actively seeking contracts in many placesDanziger speaking last_month to Skift an industry publication called Scion a four-star lifestyle brand with wide geographic appealThat kind of brand can be in every city tertiary secondary he said So how many is that The opportunity is for hundredsBecause of the prohibition on foreign deals Danziger said the company is going to have full focus instead of some focus on growth domestically of both Trump and Scion The expansion will not be easy according to analysts The Trumps will be entering a crowded marketplace of new hotel lines from Marriott Hilton and Hyatt designed to appeal to a broad cross-section of customers said Michael J Bellisario a senior research analyst with the firm Robert W Baird & CoThere are so many more competitors out there today Bellisario saidFor the Trumps to distinguish their projects from their competitors they will need to be choosy about locations Bellisario said Youve got to be on the right street corner in the right market You cant open these hotels in Topeka Kansas he said So when you think about that how big can the new line getThe plan is a big test for the younger TrumpsJust as Donald Trump stepped out from his fathers shadow in the 1970s to build the family real_estate business into todays worldwide collection of golf courses hotels condo towers branded merchandise and other commercial holdings now Donald Trump Jr 39 and Eric Trump 33 have a chance to make their mark Along with their sister Ivanka who departed the company when their father entered office the brothers have long served_as executive vice presidentsBefore their father ran for president the three siblings helped expand the firm from focusing on New_York to including the management of luxury hotels in top US cities and seven countries plus more_than a dozen golf coursesThe fruits of that work are still coming as last_month the company opened a new golf club in Dubai and last_week held a grand opening for a new hotel-condominium tower in Vancouver BCA major transition for the sons is taking over a company in which the force behind every Trump company offering whether it was selling hotel rooms office buildings golf outings ties or raw steaks was Donald Trump himselfIn interviews Trump Jr and Eric Trump said they consider themselves protectors of the Trump brand an effort they said is sometimes misunderstood Critics viewed the announcement of Scion during the campaign as a move away from the Trump name The familys intent was the opposite since they view the name Trump has a standard for luxury that ought to be insulated they will use other brands for less pricey productsWe would never want to dilute the real_estate brand by going into tertiary markets that cant sustain the [luxury] properties as we build them Eric Trump said A lot of hotel companies have gotten this wrongBoth sons worked for their father starting at young ages doing landscaping and other labor on his projectsA University of Pennsylvania graduate Trump Jrs first assignment at the company was to work with executives at New_York City real_estate projectsEric Trump joined after graduating from Georgetown in 2006 He has overseen the Trump Winery near Charlottesville and worked on the Trump hotel in Las Vegas where he developed a reputation as a hands-on executiveIf theres a property tax issue or any litigation he flies into Las Vegas and takes care of it said Phil Ruffin a casino mogul who is the Trumps partner in the Las Vegas project He hires the lawyer If there are any capital improvements he approves them He is very energetic like his father he will just work night and dayWith their father in charge there was an informal division of labor among his three eldest children governing which projects each swooped in to helpIvanka Trump created her own brands of shoes jewelry handbags and coats She took the lead on some of the Trump Organizations most prominent recent projects such as the $212million DC hotel which had its soft opening in SeptemberIm probably the most obviously like [Trump Sr] Ivanka Trump said in a 2011 company video titled Trump The Next GenerationIn certain ways she added Eric is very similar to him in terms of his love of construction and building And Don has his sense of humorThe Trumps planned corporate expansion comes as the president has faced intense criticism from Democrats and ethics_experts for his continued ownership interestA liberal watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) has sued Trump arguing that his hotel operations violate a constitutional provision barring the president from accepting gifts or payments from a foreign government Some Democrats have argued that Trumps international trademarks including one long-sought registration granted in February by China also violate the Constitutions emoluments clauseTrump has called the CREW lawsuit totally without meritAmey of the Project on Government Oversight said there were ways for the Trumps to avoid potential domestic conflicts related to the hotel expansion He said they could put the hotel business under another corporate structure which does_not involve a trust directly owned by the president himselfThere are solutions to solving this [but] there doesnt seem to be a will and a desire to do that within the White_House Amey saidThe Trump brothers say they are taking ethics concerns seriously and are doing everything necessary to avoid distracting from their fathers work as presidentHave I used him as a sounding board in the past Onehundred percent Trump Jr said Have I learned a lot from him Couldnt have had a better mentor But hes got real stuff hes got to deal with These are real peoples lives So this notion that he is still running the business from the White_House is just insaneTrump Jr scoffed at the idea that his father might have somehow viewed running for president spending millions of dollars of his own money to run against more_than a dozen Republican challengers and Democratic nominee Hillary_Clinton when few pundits gave him a chance to win as a moneymaking endeavorThats not a get-rich-quick scheme he said That doesnt make any sense whatsoeverPresident Trump suggested Thursday that the FBI may have had a hand in creating an intelligence dossier that alleged ties between Russia and Trumps presidential campaignWorkers of firm involved with the discredited and Fake Dossier take the 5th Who paid for it Russia the FBI or the Dems (or all) Trump wrote on TwitterThe compendium of information about Trump much of it unproven was produced by a former_British intelligence agent last_year mostly before Trump won the 2016 election Officials have said the FBI has confirmed some of the information and rejected other parts and caution that it may be impossible to verify or disprove the rest Trump has vigorously denied allegations in the document that the Russian_government has collected compromising_information about him and was engaged in an active effort to assist his campaignThe Washington_Post has previously reported that the FBI agreed in October 2016 to pay the dossiers author Christopher_Steele for further work that might help its own investigation_into Russian election activitiesThe FBI as well as the Senate_Intelligence Committee is investigating Russian_interference in the election and alleged contacts between Trumps associates and the KremlinAs the allegations contained in the dossier began appearing in news stories and the dossier itself became the subject of intense public debate Steele became a publicly known figure and the FBI did_not pursue further work from him The_Post reported in February Trumps Twitter question about whether the FBI may have paid for the document suggests that he is asking whether the bureau had been involved earlier in the process although his precise meaning is unclearAn FBI spokesman declined to commentRepublicans particularly Senate_Judiciary Chairman Charles E Grassley (Iowa) have sought further answers from the FBI about its relationship with Steele and its plan to pay him for information that could incriminate Trump or his associatesIt is not uncommon for the FBI to pay sources of information and Steele was well known to the FBI Previously Steele had helped the FBI put together a sprawling global bribery case involving FIFA the governing body of world soccerWhen Steele started compiling the dossier in 2016 he was doing so for a Washington firm called Fusion_GPS The firm began researching Trump first for an unidentified GOP donor and then later for DemocratsRepublican lawmakers have been pressing Fusion_GPS for months to identify those who paid for Steeles work but the firm has refused Fusion_GPS says that it has promised confidentiality to its clients and that violating that obligation would harm its business modelOn Wednesday a lawyer for Fusion_GPS said the firms employees refused to testify in response to a subpoena from the House_Intelligence Committee invoking their constitutional privilege not to do so The firms founder Glenn Simpson had previously given a 10-hour interview to the Senate_Judiciary CommitteeThe dossier alleged among other things that associates of Trump colluded with the Kremlin on cyberattacks on DemocratsTrump said Monday that there was no collusion with Russia and that special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_IIIs investigation_into Russian election activities should conclude quickly Muellers probe however is broader than just the collusion inquestSteele began his Trump investigation in June_2016 after working for another client preparing a report on Russian efforts to interfere with politics in EuropeUS intelligence had been independently tracking Russian efforts to influence electoral outcomes in EuropeRussian regime has been cultivating supporting and assisting TRUMP for at_least 5 years Steele wrote that JuneSteeles information was provided by an intermediary to the FBI and US intelligence officials after the Democratic_National Convention in July 2016 when hacked Democratic emails were first released by WikiLeaks according to a source familiar with the events After the convention Steele contacted a friend in the FBI to personally explain what he had foundBefore Donald Trump proposed a 1000-mile wall on the US-Mexico border to stop migrants he tried to build a two-mile barrier on a pristine stretch of Irish coast to rein in an oceanHe didnt succeedIrish surfers weekend beachcombers environmental scientists local planners and even a microscopic snail got in his way In December Trump International Golf Links backed down from plans it had said were essential to protect the companys lone Irish course picturesquely nestled in dunes overlooking the Atlantic from being swallowed by rising seasFor a man who loves to win the defeat just a month after his election as president has left a bitter taste And despite the motley nature of the resistance Trump seems to have singled out a lone culprit the European_Union whose rules and regulations underpinned many of the objectionsIn interviews and public statements Trump has cited his tangle over the golf-course wall as Exhibit A in justifying a jaundiced view of the EU that puts him at odds with decades of bipartisan US foreign policyPrevious presidents Democrats and Republicans alike have seen the EU as an essential partner in global stability and a bulwark against the self-interested nationalism that spawned two world wars To Trump the blocs environmental protection regulations were a threat to his exquisitely manicured fairways and putting greensI found it to be a very unpleasant experience he told British and German interviewers last_month after bringing up the wall dispute unbidden when asked his opinion of the EUA bad experience he emphasized weeks later as he raised the issue at his first White_House news conferenceThe bureaucratic battle over a golf-course sea wall makes for an unlikely inflection point in geopolitical history And yet in Europe Trumps hostility toward the union that backers credit with keeping decades of continental peace is seen as a potentially fatal blowEuropean Council President Donald Tusk recently took the extraordinary step of including Trump on alist of threats to the already teetering EU right alongside China Russia and radical Islam The golf-course dispute of course is not the only explanation for Trumps disdain He has also criticized the EUs status as a trading rival to the United_States the predominance within the bloc of German interests and its suppression of national identitiesBut that a relatively minor spat at a golf course has any bearing on such a major foreign_policy stance is baffling to some of those who battled the wall especially they say because Trump has his facts wrongHe speaks as though it was the EU that stopped it It wasnt said Dave Flynn co-chair of a local surfers group that opposed the sea barrier Its amazing that such a big foreign_policy decision like this could be made on such an ill-informed basisThe 18-hole golf resort in the west Irish village of Doonbeg is a relatively small and recent addition to Trumps global business empire which he signed over to his sons just before entering the White HouseIronically the resort was originally built with the help of a $4million grant from the EU The money was intended to spur rural development And for a time it did drawing international tourists and more_than 200 jobs to a village where cattle farming fishing and a handful of pubs had been the mainstays of the local economyBut by early 2014 just over a decade after opening the resort was struggling battered by the one-two punch of an Irish economy still reeling from the global downturn and severe winter storms that left the course badly damagedTrumps company swooped in and bought it at a deep discount reportedly for about $15millionThat spring Trump paid his new asset a visit At nearby Shannon Airport he was given a red-carpet welcome complete with a harpist and a handshake from the Irish finance minister In a radio interview he said he would invest about $45million in a dramatic upgrade and expansion of the resorts facilitiesBut as storms continued to pound away at the greens it became apparent that any investment would come to naught unless the fragile and ever-shifting dunes upon which the course is built were better defendedInitially the companys solution was to begin dumping piles of rock along the beach But the work lacked the necessary permits from County Clare and was haltedUltimately Trump International put an audacious plan before the county council a two-mile 200000-ton 15-foot-high rock wall that would sharply divide the dunes from the adjacent Doughmore BeachIt was a quantum leap from anything we had seen Flynn said It was big and brash just hugely shockingFlynn who works as a development manager said that he has been surfing at Doughmore for more_than 20 years The wide sandy half-moon beach is regarded as the best surf spot in western Ireland he said During the spring summer and autumn its perfect It just tracks in wavesHe and fellow club members quickly concluded that Trumps wall would destroy their meccaNature doesnt like hard lines he said The beach will erode at the front and the dunes will die at the back They need to work togetherResidents of Doonbeg a tiny verdant and windswept village on the Atlantic coast took a different view Trump International said it needed the wall to keep the resort open With course visitors pumping money into the economy locals rallied around Trump Internationals plan The scenery is beautiful here but you cant eat it You need to build in order to survive and thrive said Rita McInerney who owns a local cafe and general store and whose family has been in Doonbeg for seven generations Some people think were selling our souls by dealing with Trump International But prospects are few and far between in an area like this And the fact is its 200 jobs plus the spinoff for local businessesCoincidentally Vice_President Pence has ancestors who hail from Doonbeg which has also helped to consolidate local supportTrump has kept the jobs here and kept the tourists coming in He made a promise to the people of Doonbeg and he made good on it said Hugh McNally a local restaurant owner and Pences third cousinMcNally said that much of the opposition to the wall was generated based on political opposition to Trump and that it came from outside the villageOpponents acknowledge their outsider status but insist the objections they lodged with county planners are based on genuine concern for an important natural habitat Some of the legal objections though not all were based on the sites EU designation as a special area of conservation and a habitat for the narrow-mouthed whorl snail a rare and protected speciesIf you damage the dunes then you eventually eliminate the snails habitat said Tony Lowes director of Friends of the Irish Environment They will go if a wall is put in placeTrump has fumed at such arguments calling them environmental tricks to stop a project from being built in an interview with the and Germanys BildHe also said his company had received the approvals very quickly from Ireland and then Ireland and my people went to the EU to get the approval It was going to take yearsThe reality however is that EU approval was never needed and Irish approval was never given The project was stalled at the county level with planners weighing objections based on local national and EU law A petition at the national level was rejectedTrump encouraged Britain to leave the EU and has said he believes other members will follow After the Brexit vote last June he in a ribbon-cutting at one of his Scottish golf courses Turnberry saying the vote was a positive because it would depress the value of Britains currencyWhen the pound goes down he said more people are coming to TurnberryThats proved correct The course has seen an upturn in businessSo has Doonbeg with the course benefiting from what its general manager Joe Russell said is an investment of over $25million in upgrades since Trump International bought itBut the resort will not be getting the rock wall at_least not as originally planned Just weeks after Trumps victory in November the company withdrew its proposal rather_than answer 51 questions posed by county planners Russell said the decision was made because approval would have taken years that the company does_not haveInstead Trump International has proposed two smaller walls which together are less_than a third the size of the original We hope [the new plan] will proceed through the planning process quicker Russell saidBut the battle continues Many of the same groups that opposed the original wall have objected to the new plan arguing that when the smaller barriers inevitably fail Trump International will be back demanding bigger onesSea walls Lowes said beget sea walls Karla_Adam in London contributed to this reportIt was Saturday night and Palm Beachs tony Mar-a-Lago_Club was packed There was a wedding reception in the ballroom There was a full house for dinner on the terraceAnd at one table on the terrace there was the president and the leader of a major US ally hashing out a national_security problem in the open airSomeone opened up a laptop and at the table a group of Japanese people stood around the prime_minister and Donald and they were all looking at the laptop said Jay Weitzman a member of President Trumps Mar-a-Lago_Club and founder of the Pennsylvania-based parking management company Park America He was sitting three tables away from Trump and Japanese_Prime Minister_Shinzo Abe on Saturday eveningWhoa Weitzman remembered thinking Whats going onTurns out it was a missile_launch he said MondayAs Weitzman and other patrons watched Saturday evening Trump and Abe remained at the table and discussed their response to a ballistic_missile test by North_Korea While waiters came and went and while one club member snapped photos the two leaders reviewed documents by the light of an aides cellphoneThat strange scene in which Trump turned his table into an alfresco situation room astounded White_House veterans who were used to presidents retiring to private secured settings to hash out such an eventTrump became president in part because of Democrat Hillary_Clintons neglect of information security During the 2016 campaign Trump repeatedly called for Clinton to be jailed and his crowds at rallies often chanted Lock_her up for her use of a private email server to handle government business while she was secretary of state Now Trump is drawing fire from Democrats for his own seemingly loose attitude toward information security He has continued to use an insecure cellphone according to the New_York Times He may have left a key to classified information on his desk while visitors were in the Oval_Office according to a tweet from a Democratic senator And now Trump has used his bustling club in Palm_Beach Fla as a winter White_House except that unlike the actual White_House the club is full of other people Sean_Spicer the White_House press_secretary told_reporters Monday that no classified material was shared at the table at Mar-a-Lago and that Trump had been briefed in a secure location both before and after dinnerThe scene was On Monday Democrats blasted Trump for his handling of the momentTheres no excuse for letting an international crisis play out in front of a bunch of country club members like

to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis who oversees the agency that protects the presidents communications McCaskill and Carper said they were concerned about media reports that Trump is still using his old Android phone to send Twitter messagesMcCaskill and Carper said that if a foreign power was able to hack that phone it could be turned into an always-on listening post in the presidents pocketThe national_security risks of compromising a smartphone used by [the president] are considerable the senators wroteLast week Sen Martin Heinrich (D-NM) tweeted an Associated Press photo showing Trump with the chief_executive of Intel standing by a stack of papers on Trumps desk along with a black bag and a key in sight Never leave a key in a classified lockbag in the presence of non-cleared people Heinrich It is hard to recall any other instance in recent US history when the president seemed to handle an urgent national_security matter in a public placeOn Sept 11 2001 of course President George_W Bush learned of that days terrorist attacks while he was reading a book to children at a Florida elementary school Bush continued reading for at_least five minutes before being whisked away on Air Force One to a secure location In Barack_Obamas White_House two former aides said a situation like the North_Korean missile test might have been handled similarly the president would be given a note with the news then taken to a secure room to discuss a response Pete Souza who was Obamas White_House photographer posted a photo Monday that showed Obama huddling with national_security advisers

stresses of his new job Hes in a safe space said Mar-a-Lago member Robin Bernstein an insurance executiveSaturday night as guests streamed into Mar-a-Lago for dinner and the wedding reception a parking lot near the club had been converted into a security-check area for vehicles entering the estate A string of BMWs Mercedes and other high-end vehicles were backed up waiting to get through the checkpoint which was staffed by Secret_Service agents and officers from the Palm_Beach County Sheriffs OfficeInside the club Trump and Abe entered the dining terrace to a standing ovation club members told The Washington_Post The two leaders and their wives sat down on the noisy terrace among other diners Richard DeAgazio a retired investor and club member from the Boston area was about six tables away Already that day his status as a Mar-a-Lago member had given him unprecedented access to the president He had snapped pictures of Trump and Abe golfing and taken a photo with White_House strategist_Stephen K BannonDuring dinner DeAgazio got a text a friend asking him if he was aware of the North_Korean missile test He looked over at the presidents tableThats when I saw things changing you know DeAgazio recalled in a telephone interview DeAgazio said a group of staffers surrounded the two world leaders The prime ministers staff sort of surrounded him and they had a little powwowAs Trump and Abe turned their dinner table into an impromptu situation room DeAgazio continued taking pictures and he posted them on Facebook that night The President receiving the news about the Missile

shake hands and schmooze with members and guests at the club all of whom had paid Trumps business to be there (or been paid-for by their hosts)DeAgazio said he was impressed with how the president handled the situationThere wasnt any panicked look Most of the people [on the terrace] didnt even realize what was happening DeAgazio said I thought he handled it very calmly and very presidentially Weitzman the parking garage entrepreneur said he didnt notice any weariness or concern in the presidents face even after the news from North_Korea He said Trump was jovial The president for instance complimented Weitzmans son-in-law on his recent weight loss Its amazing Weitzman said You_know the president of the United_States comes over and says You lost a little weight How ya doingDeAgazio the Boston retiree said he was impressed that Trump had not gotten up from the table immediately when the North_Korean news brokeHe chooses to be out on the terrace with the members It just shows that hes a man of the people DeAgazio saidMembership at the Mar-a-Lago_Club now requires a $200000 initiation fee a fee that after Trump was electedDeAgazio said he wasnt worried about the national_security implications of Trumps alfresco discussion with Abe He said he was sure they had not been overheardYou dont hear anything You cant hear because of the background music and other diners chatter

President-elect Donald Trump that inmates inBristol County Mass will help him build his contentiouswall along the US-Mexico borderBristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said at his inauguration ceremony Wednesday that he plans to put inmatevolunteers from the Bristol County House of Correction to work along the southern border Its part of Hodgsons proposal for a nationwide network of inmate workers who could help with things like natural disastercleanup and large infrastructureprojectsI can think of no other project that would have such a positive impact on our inmates and our country than building this wall theRepublican sheriff said at Bristol Community College during his swearing-in ceremony for his fourth six-year term in office Aside from learning and perfecting construction skills the symbolism of these inmates building a wall to prevent crime in communities around the country and to preserve jobs and work opportunities for them and other Americans upon release can be very powerful he said During the presidential campaign building a massive wall along the 2000-mile border atMexicos expense an effort to keep outundocumentedimmigrants terrorists and illegal drugsThe idea became a focal point at Trumps campaign rallies with supporters chanting Trump has remained resolute in his planHodgson a reported longtime opponent of illegal immigrationsaid Trumps wall must be builtWe wont have legitimate immigration reform in this country until we build a wall Hodgson said Wednesday according to the Herald NewsAmid debate over who would foot the bill for the wallHodgson announced Project NICE (National Inmates Community Endeavors)a program aimed_at rehabilitating inmates by giving them work skills while also providing free labor for bigjobs He said inmates would respond to needs across the country including cleanup and repairs after catastrophicevents such as earthquakes hurricanes andtornadoes They would also work on major projects such as Trumps border wallThink of how_much good could come of 500 or 1000 extra hands in rebuilding a community after a disaster and the inmates would learn valuable construction skills and on-the-job training as part of their rehabilitation Hodgson said Jonathan Darling a spokesman for the sheriffs office told The Washington_Post on Thursday that getting Project NICE off the ground will be a top priorityforHodgson during his next six years in officeDarling saidHodgson has been speaking withother sheriffs about his plan for a national network of inmate workers which woulddivide the country into four regions Then when a natural disaster strikesDarling said inmates in thatarea who have volunteered to be in the program would respondAlthoughHodgson did_not say Wednesday who would pay to transport and secure inmates on-siteDarling said the sheriff is hoping to partner with theFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) an arm of theDepartment of Homeland_Security anduse federal funding to help cover those costsNow that the sheriff has announced his plan for Project NICE he is working to make it official Darling saidThe Bristol County Sheriffs Department will soon give a formal presentation at the annual meeting for the National Sheriffs AssociationThe sheriffs office has reached out to Trumps transition team to formally offer to help build the wall sheriffs officials had not heard back as of Thursday morning Darling said Trump officials did_not immediately respond to a request for comment The proposal has drawn rebuke from the American Civil Liberties Union in Massachusetts which called the sheriffs plan perverseIts inhumane and its most likely unconstitutional Laura Rtolo staff counsel with the ACLU Its also likely an attempt by Sheriff Hodgson just to ride this wave and become famous nationally I hope we dont have to take this proposal seriouslyRtolo saidthe ACLU is prepared to take the sheriff to court over the matterIf Sheriff Hodgson follows through on this gimmick the ACLU of Massachusetts is prepared to use every tool in our toolbox including litigation to stop him Rtolo told the newspaper The wall itself is based on racism and hatred and no self-respecting Massachusetts official should have anything to do with itThe idea of using modern-day slave labor to send people thousands of miles away from their Massachusetts home to build a wall to keep out other vulnerable populations its just preposterous she addedDarling the Bristol County Sheriffs Department spokesmanstressed that only inmates who volunteer for the work program will becalled onWe would never force them to do it he saidDarling called it a benefit for qualifying prisoners inBristol County (and beyond) totake part in existing inmate work programs which help shave time off their sentences and give them vocational skills they can use oncethey are released He noted however that the Bristol County Sheriffs Departmentdoesnt send violent offenders to help through the inmate work program nor would it expect other departments to do so through Project NICEAsked about the border wallDarling said the sheriff thought it would be a good project for the inmatesHodgson he said hopesto

with the pressTrump announced his decision on Twitter late Saturday afternoon The dinner is scheduled for April 29On Sunday White_House spokeswoman Sarah_Huckabee Sanders thatthere had been tensions between the president and the mediaI think its kind of naive of us to think that we can all walk into a room for a couple of hours and pretend that some of that tension isnt there Sanders told This Week host George StephanopoulosTrump would skip the dinner to instead spend the night focused on what he can do to help better America Sanders saidYou know one of the things we say in the South [is] If a Girl Scout egged your house would you buy cookies from her I_think that this is a pretty similar scenario Sanders added Theres no reason for him to go in and sit and pretend like this is going to be just another Saturday night(The response came at the end of her appearance on the show Pretty straight answer Stephanopoulos replied I_think a lot would argue the eggs have gone both ways on that But were going to have to leave it there today)I will not be attending the White_House Correspondents Association Dinner this year Please wish everyone well and have a great evening Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Shortly after Trumps tweet on Saturday the president of the White_House Correspondents Association which sponsors theannual event said in an email that the dinner would take_place even without Trumps attendanceThe dinner has been and will_continue to be a celebration of the First Amendment and the important role played by an independent news media in a healthy republic said Jeff Mason WHCA president We look forward to shining a spotlight at the dinner on some of the best political journalism of the past_year and recognizing the promising students who represent the next generation of our professionSince Trumps inauguration amidhis increasingly fraught relationship with the press Throughout his campaign heregularly lashed out at the press singling out news outlets as being dishonest and at one point Sincehis election he has accused certain media outlets of publishing fake_news Earlier this month the tense relationship reached a boil when Trump

White_House Correspondents Associationawards $100000 in scholarships at the annual dinner according to its website and recently started a mentoring program that pairs working journalists with journalism studentsThe annual dinner began in 1921 and in 1924 Calvin Coolidge became the first president to attend the dinner In 1978 Jimmy Carter declined to attend citing exhaustion First lady Rosalynn Carter and Vice_President Walter Mondale also didnt show up that year In 1981 President Ronald_Reagan managed to deliver remarks by phone even though he was at Camp David recovering from an assassination attemptIf I could give you just one little_bit of advice when somebody tells you to get in a car quick do it Trump has attended the dinner beforeIn 2011 then-President Barack_Obama roasted Trump at the dinner five minutes of jokes directed at the man who had raised questions about whether Obama was born in the United StatesNo one is happier no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald said Obama who ultimately released his birth certificate Thats because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter like Did we fake the moon landing What really happened in Roswell And where are Biggie and TupacAt the time Obama joked about Trumps experience to lead the nation All kidding aside obviously we all know about your credentials and breadth of experience Obama said For example no seriously just recently in an episode of Celebrity Apprentice at the steakhouse the mens cooking team did_not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks And there was a lot of blame to go around but you Mr Trump recognized that the problem was a lack of leadership and so ultimately you didnt blame Little John or Meatloaf you fired Gary Busey And these are the kinds of decisions that would keep me up at night Well-handled sir Well-handledObama ended his roast talking_about the change a President Trump would bring to the White

nomination itll be yet_another example of blatant dismissal of the value of scientific expertise among his administration appointees Salvador said in a statement Continuing to choose politics over science will give farmers and consumers little confidence that the administration has their interests at heartWoteki said in an interview with on Friday that since the position serves as the agencys chief_scientist the occupant should be a person who evaluates the scientific body of evidence and moves appropriately from thereIn the same radio interview Clovis said I have enough of a science

rejected his attorneys appeal to have the case dismissed over incendiary remarks made by President Trump during his campaign for the White HouseIt was never my intention for anyone to be hurt said Bergdahl 31 while reading from prepared remarks He apologized for the horrible mistake of abandoning his post in Afghanistan and endangering other US troops tasked with finding him after his disappearance in 2009 They suffered he said because of my bad choicesBergdahl has pleaded_guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy He faces life in prisonHis testimony came as the judge Army Col Jeffery R Nance weighs Trumps comments the president has called Bergdahl a dirty rotten traitor and suggested he should be executed against the horrific treatment Bergdahl endured while in captivity and the testimony of other troops who were wounded during the search Though Nance denied Bergdahls motion to dismiss the case he said he would consider Trumps comments as mitigating evidence that could lessen the punishment Bergdahl receives if any During his testimony Bergdahl described his torture his failed escape attempts his declining health and his dimming prospects for survivalIn detailing his captivity he explained that dirt floors were preferable to cement because they allowed him to bury the chronic diarrhea he experienced thus avoiding further abuse from angry guards who threatened to cut_off his nose and ears if he did_not stop getting sick He was beat with hoses and kept in a cage much of the time he saidAs he recalled his ordeal one memory caused him to start shaking His face turned red But rather_than tell the court what had surfaced in his mind Bergdahl elected to stop But the court also heard Monday from the prosecutions final witness Shannon Allen whose husband Mark a former master sergeant in the National Guard was nearly killed while searching for Bergdahl Allen was paralyzed after being shot in the head to collect intelligence on Bergdahls whereaboutsHe was very loud and outgoing Allen said about her_husband before he was wounded Areas of his brain that affect memory and motor skills were removed in surgery she said and he can no_longer speak walk or care for himself She takes him to appointments and emergency room visits when he appears in distressHe lost me as a wife Ive become his caregiver It doesnt mean I love him any less she said her voice shakingThe court was shown a video of Allen readying her_husband for the day as he lay nearly motionless The defense team had objected to scheduling Allens testimony saying the impact on her was too far removed from Bergdahls actions to be considered a factor in his sentencing But Nance allowed it saying her testimony conveyed how one soldiers life has been permanently altered Bergdahl watched the video And he too offered how his actions in 2009 have bled into the present where flashbacks and hyper-vigilance he said grip him day and nightHe works an administration job at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio near a building where animals are kept Among the peacocks and ducks is at_least one rooster Bergdahl said whose call every morning is hauntingHis captors forced him to watch execution videos In one Bergdahl said theres an eerie silence before a mans beheading And then he recalled You can hear the rooster crowingThe US military began deploying an advanced defensive missile system to South_Korea on Monday a long-awaited move that was agreed upon with the government in Seoul last_summer and follows a series of provocations by North KoreaThe Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defense_(THAAD) system does_not use warheads and is designed to shoot down enemy ballistic_missiles like the ones launched by Pyongyang into the Sea of Japan on Sunday The deployment comes despite protests from Chinese officials who have said repeatedly over the last_year that it is threat to Chinese securityContinued provocative actions by North_Korea to include yesterdays launch of multiple missiles only confirm the prudence of our alliance decision last_year to deploy THAAD to South_Korea said Navy Adm Harry Harris chief of the US Pacific Command We will resolutely honor our alliance commitments to South_Korea and stand ready to defend ourselves the American homeland and our alliesChina warned Tuesday that for hosting the THAAD system and stepped up retaliatory measures against South_Korean business interestsThe deployment was announced as North_Korean state_media reported that the four_missiles Pyongyang launched Sunday were Three of the missiles traveled about 600_miles over North_Korea and the Sea of Japan before landing inside of Japans_exclusive economic_zone The fourth landed just outside the EEZNorth Korea also is believed to have thousands of artillery cannons aimed_at its southern neighbor a particular concern for Seoul because the city of 10 million is within range 35 miles from North_Koreas borderEach THAAD battery includes at_least six truck-mounted launchers that carry up to eight missiles each US military officials stress that it provides strictly defensive capabilities but it also possesses powerful radar that Chinese officials are concerned will be used to observe Chinese airspaceWe firmly oppose the deployment of THAAD said Geng_Shuang a spokesman for Chinas Foreign_Ministry at a daily press briefing in Beijing on Tuesday We will resolutely take necessary measures to defend our security interestsAll the consequences from this will be borne by the US and the ROK he added referring to South_Korea We strongly urge relevant parties to stop deploying it and not travel down the wrong pathSouth Koreas left-wing opposition parties also sharply criticized the governments unilateral rushed move to deploy the THAAD battery ahead of scheduleThe government has completely disregarded public calls and demands from political circles with regard to the THAAD_deployment said Youn Kwan-suk the spokesman for the Democratic PartyFrom the clandestine push for the deployment to the process of making the final decision on the installation the government has unilaterally pressed ahead with it without any consultations with citizens he said according to the Yonhap news agencySeveral key details of the deployment have not yet been finalized and the land where the battery will be housed is not yet ready opposition politicians said But South_Korean defense officials said they would keep the equipment at the US air base at Osan until the site is readyWhen Seoul and Washington agreed last_year on the THAAD unit they were aiming for deployment by the end of July although it had been expedited and was expected to arrive between June and AugustWith the arrival of the first components they could have it up and running sooner The deployment could be completed within one or two months and it can be operational as early as April a South_Korean military official told_reporters in SeoulConservative politicians said that North_Koreas latest missile_launches underscored the urgent need for THAADWe welcome the right decision to deploy THAAD when North_Korea threatens the security of the Republic of Korea and Northeast Asia by firing as many as four ballistic_missiles said Kim Sung-won the spokesman for the ruling Liberty Korea PartyThe timing is politically sensitive because the president Park_Geun-hye is likely to find out this week whether she will be impeached The Constitutional_Court is expected to issue its decision as soon as Friday on whether to uphold a parliamentary motion to force Park out of office over a corruption scandalMoon Jae-in the leading liberal candidate for the presidency has said he would respect agreements between governments but he has also suggested that he might ask parliament to revisit the THAAD deploymentThe United_States and South_Korea began discussing the deployment of THAAD more_than a year ago and reached an agreement to do so in July Then-President to the deployment in October saying Washington and Seoul have worked together to prepare for any threat He specifically cited THAAD as an example while calling it a purely defensive system to deter and defend against North_Korean threatsDefense Secretary Jim Mattis made his first trip as Pentagon chief to Seoul and Tokyo in January and said then that he anticipated THAAD would arrive in South_Korea this yearThe news of on Monday elicited cheers in Ukraine where activists and politicians seeking to root out political corruption had seethed at the American political operatives counsel to the countrys ousted leader Viktor YanukovychReports of the millions of dollars Manafort had been paid under the table by Ukraines formerruling party were particularly galling and Ukrainians learned from the indictment Monday those payments may have been even larger than thoughtBut while Washington is wondering where the into Russian_meddling in the US elections will lead next people here are wondering more about what this means for the investigation_into the millions of dollars in oligarch wealth that have stubbornly slowed the countrys program of reformIts great news There should be a precedent of punishment for the lobbyists who served these corrupt figures said Serhiy Leshchenko a Ukrainian member of parliament and investigative journalist who published documents showing secret payments to Manafort by the ruling party under Yanukovych and then invoices to Manafort consulting companies on the same dayManafort worked for a long time so that Yanukovych could come to power and use that power for his own corrupt schemes not for reformThe investigation as he saw it is far from finished I want investigations into all of Manaforts connections and the people who paid him this money he added naming several prominent Ukrainian oligarchsIn a decades-long career Manafort made tens of millions of dollars far beyond the borders of established democracies working for despotic leaders and their allies in countries such as the Philippines and CongoBut his work in one country Ukraine caught up with him on Monday in a criminal indictment describing illicit earnings offshore bank_accounts and lavish expenditures funded in part by nearly a decade of work for Ukraines Party of Regions and Yanukovych who fled to Russia after his regime was toppled by protesters in 2014Despite reports of secret payments Mondays 12-count_indictment against Manafort and a former business_partner still yielded newaccusations for Ukrainian prosecutors investigating the former Yanukovych administrationAmong them lobbying members of Congress for the Ukrainian government in one case using an offshore account to secretly funnel $4 million to commission a report about the trial of former Ukrainian prime_minister Yulia Tymoshenko This was new information for us Serhiy Gorbatyuk the head of special investigations for the prosecutors office said in a telephone interviewIt took an unlikely confluence of events the 2014 political revolution in Ukraine that ousted Yanukovych the discovery of secret campaign finance documents at the headquarters of Ukraines ruling Party of Regions and then Manaforts leading role as campaign_manager for President Trump for Mueller to zero in on Manaforts alleged schemes to launder money evade US taxes and engage in conspiracy against the United StatesIn Kiev where politicians have been careful the Trump administration Manafort remains just a witness as prosecutors pursue corruption charges_against the Yanukovych administration Gorbatyuk said his requests to the US Justice_Department to cooperate had not received a responseIn order for the case to move_forward better we need answers to our questions So far we havent received any Manafort at this moment is a witness in the case he saidWhile in Kiev the extent of Manaforts wealth was not Mondays indictment alleged that more_than $75 million flowed through offshore_accounts Manafort and his partner_Rick Gates maintained and that Manafort sent more_than $54million to vendors for home improvements and $934350 to an antique rug store It alleged as well that he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars more on antiques landscaping Range Rovers and home entertainment systemsHe made that money while working for some of the regions richest men including Russian oligarch Deripaska in a 2014 Cayman Islands court filing had accused Manafort and Gates of absconding with $19 million of his money earmarked for investments Yet in 2016 Manafort had suggested providing Deripaska with private briefings while he was Trumps campaign chairmanBut the focus of Mondays indictment was the money Manafort made working as a political adviser in Ukraine developing the election strategies that helped revive the political career of Yanukovych from a bitter defeat in a contested 2004 presidential_election up until his ouster by pro-European street demonstrators in 2014Party allies recalled that Manafort coached unpolished politicians from the countrys industrial regions streamlining their talking_points and improving their choice in suits Others said he helped parse demographic polls to take advantage of the deep divide between the countrys regionsOn Monday allies and associates of Manaforts in Ukraine where he remains a deeply divisive figure brushed off the allegations calling them the result of a politically motivated witch_hunt following Trumps unexpected ascendancy to the presidencyI have every confidence that Paul and Rick will be vindicated by the judicial process currently ongoing in the US said Philip Griffin Manaforts longtime representative in Ukraine I am quite taken by the fact that this has nothing to do with the president or any alleged collusion between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia and that this is the result of a politically driven fishing expeditionPrevious records from a recovered black ledger of payments to Manafort from Ukraines Party of Regions detailed payments of $127 million but Mondays indictment said Manafort had laundered a larger amount more_than $18 million Manafort pleaded not guilty Monday to the 12 counts brought against himWhile Manafort allies focused on the absence of collusion allegations in the indictment the charges still sent shock waves through his network of partners and associates Speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly one associate called them a punch to the gutThe UN_Security Council unanimously adopted harsh sanctions Wednesday against North_Korea imposing some of the strongest measures ever used to pressure Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear_weapons programThe new sanctions come two months after North_Korea and a month after it conducted what was widely described as a banned missile test under the guise of But US officials began drafting the measures three years_ago soon after North_Korea conducted a previous nuclear_test in order to move swiftly the next time it happened Negotiations to win Chinas support began two days after North_Koreas January nuclear_test its fourth in a decadeThe resolution is far more sweeping than existing sanctions requiring a link to proliferation activities That precondition has been removed in effect erasing the presumption of innocence It mandates cargo inspections for all goods going in and out of North_Korea by land sea or air chokes off supplies of most aviation fuel for its armed forces and bans the sale of all small arms and conventional weapons to Pyongyang It also prohibits transactions that raise hard cash for North_Korea through sales of its natural resourcesThe resolution doubles the blacklist of people and institutions already sanctioned and requires countries to expel North_Korean diplomats involved in any sanctioned activitiesOne provision was designed to prevent Pyongyang from sending taekwondo instructors to train foreign police forces Another bars North_Koreans from specialized training at any school or research center in the world if the learning can advance Pyongyangs nuclear and ballistic_missile programsPresident Obama welcomed the sanctions as a firm and appropriate response to North_Koreas attempts to develop weapons of mass destructionToday the international_community speaking with one voice has sent Pyongyang a simple message North_Korea must abandon these dangerous programs and choose a better path for its people he saidAs soon as the sanctions were released the Treasury Department and the State_Department updated their blacklists of people and entities tied to the Democratic_Peoples Republic of Korea the official name for North_Korea and its proliferation programs The designation freezes their US assets and bars Americans from doing business with themThe UN sanctions which target the countrys elites and avoid adverse humanitarian consequences for civilians aim to accomplish what worked with less onerous sanctions on Iran by pushing theto quit pumping money into its nuclear program The chronic suffering of the people of North_Korea is the direct result of the choices made by the DPRK government a government that has consistently prioritized its nuclear_weapons and ballistic_missile programs over providing for the most basic needs of its own people said Samantha Power the US ambassador to the United NationsThe North_Korean government would rather grow its nuclear_weapons program than grow its own children she addedThe resolution was presented by the United_States with the support of China a sharp reversal given Beijings longtime support of its neighbor Although the United_States has long had an embargo on trade with North_Korea China has provided food and fuel and has been a key trading partner In recent years living conditions in North_Korea have improved thanks in large part to ChinaIn the past China has been unwilling to tighten the screws on Pyongyang in part out of concern for what an imploding unstable North_Korea might mean for Chinas own border But recently North_Korea has continued testing new weapons and missiles disregarding Chinas warnings and personal envoysAfter North_Korea on Jan 6 detonated a new device calling it a hydrogen_bomb although most experts say it was a smaller nuclear device Chinas ambassador to six-party talks Wu Dawei went to Pyongyang to urge restraint Instead North_Korea announced while he was there that it would test a missileChinas about-face suggests it has started to realize that doing nothing would impose growing political costs internationally the possibility of a greater US presence in the region and weaker relations with South_Korea which Beijing has been cultivatingI expect theres been a delayed recognition in China to the political price China was paying with South_Korea in particular for its equivocation or outright silence about how to respond to North_Korea and North_Korea actions said Jonathan Pollack a specialist on East Asian politics and security at the Brookings Institution During a visit to Washington last_month Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi hinted at the strains in policy toward North KoreaOn the one hand were saying to the international_community that the normal exchanges especially those affecting the livelihoods of the North_Korean people should not be adversely affected he said at the Center for Strategic and International_Studies On the other hand in order to uphold the international nuclear nonproliferation regime for the sake of denuclearization our exchanges will be affected to some extentBut some analysts question the depth of Chinas commitment to the latest round of sanctionsThe real question going forward is whether China will enforce the new measures said Victor Cha a professor at Georgetown University My guess is that China will squeeze for a little_bit but not too hard while the US will want China to squeeze harder and for a longer period of timeSung-Yoon Lee a Korean studies professor at Tufts University said the UN sanctions even if violated in the future will become increasingly meaningful if ordinary citizens in North_Korea are adversely affectedThe fact the UN is involved will lend greater legitimacy to the effort to sanction North_Korea and enable others like Japan and Europe to shoulder some of the blame if there are negative repercussions from sanctions so the blame doesnt just fall on the shoulders of the United_States he saidPreparatory work on the sanctions began in early 2013 immediately after the Security_Council passed a sanctions resolution in response to North_Koreas third nuclear_test according to a State_Department official who spoke about the sensitive negotiations on the condition of anonymity US officials concluded that incrementally ratcheting up sanctions was insufficient and that more restrictive measures were needed the official saidAs technical experts from many government agencies met to share ideas a contingency draft of sanctions was repeatedly updated to be ready for a fourth_nuclear test by North_Korea On Jan 8 two days after North_Korea announced the fourth test diplomats from the US mission to the United_Nations presented a draft to the Chinese mission There was little response during January as China studied the proposed sanctions which dropped requirements to prove proliferation links as China had insisted on previouslyChina did_not change its position during a Jan 27 visit to Beijing by Secretary of State John_F Kerry or during a Feb 5 phone_call that Obama placed to Chinese President_Xi JinpingBut after the Feb 7 missile test the State_Department official said the Chinese came around to the US point of view Throughout much of February US and Chinese diplomats met several times a day to discuss provisions that had to be approved by Beijing the official saidAt 8 or 9 at night diplomats at the US mission would schlep to the Chinese mission the State_Department official said Then they would meet again the next day after Beijing had worked through the provisions overnightAfter a tentative agreement was reached early last_week US officials had hoped for a quick adoption by the Security_Council But there were delays while Russia studied the sanctions to gauge their impact Russia transports coal over a short stretch of railroad in North_Korea to a port and Moscow wanted reassurances it would not be banned the official saidIn recent_days North_Korea has boasted that more sanctions would not hurt Now China South_Korea Japan and the United_States are awaiting its reaction Early Thursday hours after the sanctions were approved the North fired short-range projectiles into the sea South_Koreas Defense Ministry saidWeve seen its reckless and unpredictable acts for years Power said Weve seen threats directed at the continental United_States and the Republic of Korea Weve seen cyberattacks on American companies costing hundreds of millions of dollars We do not expect a change of behavior overnightPresident Trump woke before dawn on Monday and burrowed in at the White_House residence to wait for the Russia bombshell he knew was comingSeparated from most of his West_Wing staff who fretted over why he was late getting to the Oval_Office Trump clicked on the television and spent the morning playing fuming media critic legal analyst and crisis communications strategist according to several people close to himThe president digested the news of the first indictments in special_counsel Robert_S Mueller_IIIs probe with exasperation and disgust these people said He called his lawyers repeatedly He listened intently to cable news commentary And with rising irritation he watched live footage of his onetime campaign adviser and confidant Paul_Manafort turning himself in to the FBIInitially Trump felt vindicated Though frustrated that the media were linking him to the indictment and tarnishing his presidency he cheered that the charges_against Manafort and his deputy_Rick Gates were focused primarily on activities that began before his campaign Trump tweeted at 1028 am there is NO COLLUSIONBut the presidents celebration was short-lived A few_minutes later court_documents were unsealed showing that George_Papadopoulos an unpaid foreign_policy adviser on Trumps campaign pleaded_guilty to making a false_statement to the FBI about his efforts to broker a relationship between Trump and Russian President_Vladimir Putin The case provides the clearest evidence yet of links_between Trumps campaign and Russian officialsFor a president who revels in chaos and in orchestrating it himself Monday brought a political storm that Trump could not control White_House Chief of Staff John_F Kelly along with lawyers Ty Cobb John Dowd and Jay Sekulow advised Trump to be cautious with his public responses but they were a private sounding board for his grievances advisers saidThis has not been a cause of great agita or angst or activity at the White_House said Cobb the White_House lawyer overseeing Russia matters He added that Trump is spending all of his time on presidential work But Trumps anger Monday was visible to those who interacted with him and the mood in the corridors of the White_House was one of weariness and fear of the unknown As the president groused upstairs many staffers some of whom have hired lawyers to help them navigate Muellers_investigation privately speculated about where the special_counsel might turn nextThe walls are closing in said one senior Republican in close contact with top staffers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly Everyone is freaking outTrump is also increasingly agitated by the expansion of Muellers probe into financial issues beyond the 2016 campaign and about the potential damage to him and his familyThis portrait of Trump and his White_House on a day of crisis is based on interviews with 20 senior administration officials Trump friends and key outside allies many of whom insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive internal mattersTrump and his aides were frustrated that yet again Russia steamrolled the start of a carefully planned week of policy news Trump is preparing to nominate a new chairman of the Federal Reserve and is scheduled to depart Friday for a high-stakes 12-day trip across Asia and House Republicans are planning to unveil their tax overhaul billId like to start the briefing today by addressing a topic that I know all of you are preparing to ask me about and thats tax reform White_House press_secretary Sarah_Huckabee Sanders said at Monday afternoons news briefing It was a lighthearted prelude to a question-and-answer session immediately overtaken by queries about the indictmentsAway from the podium Trump staffers fretted privately over whether Manafort or Gates might share with Muellers_team damaging_information about other colleagues They expressed concern in particular about Gates because he has a young family may be more stretched financially than Manafort and continued to be involved in Trumps political operation and had access to the White_House including attending West_Wing meetings after Trump was sworn inSome White_House advisers are unhappy with Thomas J Barrack Jr Trumps longtime friend and chairman of his inauguration whom they hold responsible for keeping Gates in the Trump orbit long after Manafort resigned as campaign_chairman in August 2016 according to people_familiar with the situation Barrack has been Gatess patron of late steering political work to him and until Monday employing him as director of the Washington office of his real_estate investment companyTrump and his aides tried to shrug off the ominous headlines decorating the South Portico of the White_House in black bats and faux spider webs to welcome costumed children for Halloween trick-or-treating As the sun set on Monday the president and first lady Melania Trump handed out goody bags to little princesses and pirates The Russia drama has been distracting and damaging for Trump from a public relations perspective if not eventually a legal one The presidents inner circle on Russia matters has tightened in recent months In_addition to his lawyers Trump has been talking mostly with Kelly and members of his family including Melania as well as daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared_Kushner both senior White_House advisers Trump also leans on two senior aides counselor Kellyanne_Conway and communications director Hope Hicks as well as some outside friends for adviceStill Trump has little ability to influence the ongoing Russia probe save for firing Mueller the sort of rash decision that his lawyers insisted Monday he is not consideringNothing about todays events alters anything related to our engagement with the special_counsel with whom we continue to cooperate Cobb said There are no discussions and there is no consideration being given to terminating MuellerSekulow one of Trumps outside lawyers said Theres no firing-Robert-Mueller discussionsAsked whether Trump is considering pardons for Manafort or Gates Cobb said No no no Thats never come up and wont come upOn Capitol_Hill meanwhile some of Trumps allies are privately revving up their own version of a counterattack against Mueller Several top Republican legislators plan to raise questions in the coming days about the FBIs handling of a dossier detailing alleged ties between Trump and Russian interests They intend to argue that Muellers_team has become overly reliant on a document that was funded in part by Democrats according to two people involved in the discussions Mueller does_not appear to have relied on the dossier for the cases revealed on Monday howeverFor Trump and his team the bad news began as disconcerting drips last Friday when CNN first reported that indictments were probably coming Monday The only question of whomThe White_House had no inside information beyond what was public in news reports officials said and was left to scramble and speculate as to what might happen Reliable information was hard to come by as Trumps team was scattered Cobb was at his home in South Carolina until Monday afternoon while Trump spent much of Saturday at his private golf club in Virginia and went out to dinner with Melania and their son Barron at the Trump International Hotels steakhouse in WashingtonAmong the many unknowns the Trump team arrived at an educated guess that Manafort was likely to be indicted in part according to one White_House aide because of reports that television news crews were preparing to stake out Manaforts Virginia homeThis wasnt a shocking development Sekulow said When the first pair of indictments came naming Manafort and Gates there was palpable relief inside the West_Wing The 31-page document did_not name Trump nor did it address any possible collusion between Russia and the presidents campaignMoreover aides were simply happy that the initial batch of indictments did_not include Michael_Flynn Trumps former and controversial national_security adviser who was fired from his top White_House perch after misleading Vice_President Pence about his contacts with Russian officials Flynn had been intimately involved in both the campaign and the early days of the administration and a Flynn indictment most staff believed would have been far more damagingThe indictment of Gates who had played a quiet behind-the-scenes role in Trumps orbit was more of a surprise though he had served_as Manaforts campaign deputy and protege Trumps team quickly settled on a messaging plan The duos alleged misdeeds the White_House argued had nothing to do with the president or his campaignPrivately aides and allies acknowledged that the campaign had perhaps not sufficiently vetted the two men before bringing them on boardMichael Caputo a former campaign adviser whom Trump praised Monday morning on Twitter for his appearance on Fox_News Channels Fox & Friends later called the indictments one big huge failRick and Paul I would consider them friends of the president because they worked so closely with him Caputo said The presidents watching closely and he should be concerned for his friends welfare but he has absolutely no concern about collusion with Russia because there was noneOn Sunday Trump had attempted to seek refuge from the political squall with another_round of golf at his Virginia club Sens Lindsey O Graham (R-SC) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis) were set to join him according to two people briefed on the plans an afternoon of camaraderie and talk about his tax proposalIt was not to be Rainy weather forced the White_House to cancel the outing yet_another disappointment beyond the presidents control John Wagner contributed to this reportAs the United_States has looked for various ways to punish North_Korea for its nuclear intransigence one factor has remained constant ChinaFinancial transactions mineral exports luxury imports all of them come through China making the nations enforcement of international sanctions critical to their successA once-reluctant to inflict pain on Pyongyang this year But that could be changing the unintended result of the United_States and South_Koreas to protect against North KoreaChina has been complaining about this at the highest levels said Scott Snyder a Korea expert_at the Council on Foreign_Relations Will this be a factor that diminishes their implementation of UN_Security Council resolutionsPresident Park Geun-hyes administration in Seoul had been equivocating on whether to host a Terminal_High Altitude_Area Defense_(THAAD) antimissile unit for the US military fearful of angering Beijing China is South_Koreas biggest trading partner with its bilateral trade worth twice as much as that with the United_States But North_Koreas recent actions its nuclear_test and long-range missile_launch at the beginning of this year prompted Seoul to agree in July to host the battery Early Wednesday the North was reported to have test-fired a submarine-launched_ballistic missile off its east coastBeijing which views the THAAD_deployment as a way to keep China in check has taken a range of actions recently to express its displeasure The United_States has a strategic plot to destabilize regional security the state-run Peoples Daily said in an editorial shortly_after the decisionSo far this month Beijing has suspended operations of the travel agency that helped South Koreans get multiple-entry visas for China a visa used especially by those doing business with 300000 issued a year and tourism has been hitOne tour-bus company told South_Koreas CNBC channel that 30 to 40 percent of reservations had been canceled while the Dong-A newspaper quoted travel firms as saying that Chinese tour package reservations for September and October were one-fifth lower than the same months last yearSome South_Korean actors who star in dramas that are popular in China have had their public appearances canceled and some here even saw THAAD behind the Chinese city of Qingdaos last-minute decision to cancel its participation in a chicken-and-beer festival in its South_Korean sister city of Daegu Throughout North_Koreas decades of malfeasance Chinas overarching concern has been to ensure that its irascible neighbor remains intact and does_not spill hungry refugees or nuclear material over its borderBut in the past few years Beijing has shown signs of cracking down on the Kim_Jong Un regime most recently in March when it supported the UN_Security Council resolution to impose tough new sanctions on mining exports in particular on PyongyangHopes that China would follow through with implementation appear however to have been short-livedChinese customs data showed that bilateral trade with North_Korea was valued at $504million in June three months after the sanctions were imposed and the month before the THAAD announcement That is almost 10percent higher than the year beforeTrade has continued at a brisk pace in the past two months said Lim Eul-chul of Kyungnam Universitys Graduate School of North_Korean StudiesChinese companies that had held back on trading with the North have started to ship more goods after hearing the news that Seoul-Beijing relations have taken a turn for the worse over the THAAD issue Lim told the Yonhap_News Agency The effort to squeeze the North has probably been neutralized by THAAD and the Chinese response Snyder saidThe THAAD decision had coincided with other US moves to sanction Kim by name to designate North_Korea as a primary money_laundering concern and to endorse an international ruling rejecting Chinas claim to the South China SeaEven if each decision may have been correct on its own Snyder said the four things together project an image of US policy that is clearly not well received in BeijingKim Sook a former South_Korean ambassador to the United_Nations agreedTHAAD happened at the same_time as the South China Sea decision so China might have been doubly disappointed he said adding that the South_Korean decision to host the missile battery was the right one even if the timing was offStrategically our government has mishandled the case Kim said They hesitated for three years when they should have moved swiftlyA trio of watchdog groups has asked the US attorney for the Southern_District of New_York to investigate whether President Trump has received payments or other benefits from foreign governments through his business_interests in violation of an obscure clause in the US Constitution The request sent by letter Wednesday morning to is a novel strategy by ethics critics who have been pressing Trump to comply with the Constitutions emoluments_clause which prohibits top officials from receiving payments or favors from foreign governments Trumps business empire stretches across the globe The letter was sent six weeks after one of the groups filed a lawsuit in federal district court making a similar claimTrump has said he addressed ethics concerns by turning over management of his business to his adult sons whove said they have separated the family business from their relationship with their father and the US governmentThere are lines we would never cross in a recent interview and thats mixing business with anything government On Wednesday the White_House referred questions to the Trump Organization where attorney Alan Garten dismissed the letter as factually inaccurate legally erroneous and politically motivatedAlthough the president has relinquished day-to-day management of his businesses his critics say his continued ownership interest means he effectively receives benefits from foreign entities in violation of the Constitution The ethics advocates mostly Democrats have held news conferences and filed a lawsuit Now they are asking one of the countrys leading federal_prosecutors for helpWe call on you as the United_States Attorney for the jurisdiction where The Trump Organization is located to exercise your responsibility to investigate and take appropriate action to ensure that the Trump Organization and related Trump business enterprises do not receive payments and financial benefits from foreign governments that benefit President Trump the letter said It is signed by Fred Wertheimer president of Democracy 21 bipartisan leaders of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington organization (CREW) and Paul Smith of the Campaign Legal Center It cannot be the case that the president can flagrantly violate the Constitution and get away with it said Norman L Eisen who served_as ethics counsel under President_Barack Obama Eisen who signed the letter as chairman of CREW acknowledged that asking a US attorney to investigate a matter involving a sitting president is unusual But he said having a president with these conflicts is also unprecedented The letter is also signed by CREWs vice chair Richard Painter who served_as ethics counsel to President George_W BushIn January CREW in federal district court arguing that his continued receipt of payments from foreign entities violated the Constitutions emoluments_clause Trumps reply in that case is due April 1 Eisen said the request to the US attorney should not be seen as a sign that the suit will not move_forward We believe our complaint in the judicial branch should not exclude review by the other branches of government he said citing the importance of the emoluments restrictionThat clause says that no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under [the United States] shall without the Consent of the Congress accept of any present Emolument Office or Title of any kind whatever from any King Prince or foreign State It was written in to Article I out of concern that the fledgling countrys leaders could be influenced by a wealthy European power The meaning of the clause The watchdog groups say the text should be interpreted to mean that Trumps businesses should cease commercial transactions with foreign statesThe letter notes that China recently granted Trump a trademark for building construction services It also points out that tenants of Trump_Tower in New_York include a Chinese bank and the Abu Dhabi Tourism and Culture Authority and that the Trump hotel in Washington has been courting business from foreign diplomats The document notes that Trumps business entities have plans to build luxury hotels in China and that it is also engaged in real_estate and licensing projects in India Indonesia the Philippines Saudi Arabia Scotland Taiwan and Turkey We believe the Justice_Department has a broad mandate to ensure compliance with provisions of the Constitution that relate to Federal officeholders the letter said The letter noted testimony of Attorney_General Jeff_Sessions in his confirmation hearings Sessions stated that although he was not aware of a federal law that directly charges the Justice_Department with enforcing the emoluments_clause he recognized that the Justice_Department has the responsibility to ensure that officeholders comply with their constitutional obligationsWertheimer said that the request was made because he sees a powerful record that President Trump is receiving benefits that do not comply with the emoluments_clause He and other signers said Bharara was chosen in part because he is known for fierce independence Since he was appointed in 2009 he has investigated New_York Gov Andrew M Cuomo and New_York City Mayor Bill De Blasio both Democrats Although Bharara was appointed by Obama after the election and asked him to stay on as US attorneyA tearful University of Virginia student detained in North_Korea confessed in a highly orchestrated news_conference Monday to the very severe and pre-planned crime of trying to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel in Pyongyang had not been seen since on Jan2 at the end of a five-day tour to North_Korea The trip was a stopover on his way to Hong Kong where he was to take part in a university-sponsored financial classBut it wasnt until three weeks later that Kim_Jong Uns_regime announced it was holding the Ohio native for an unspecified hostile act against the state In the meantime North_Korea has conducted a nuclear_test and a long-range missile_launch inflaming tensions with the outside worldEscorted by North_Korean guards into a news_conference in Pyongyang on Monday Warmbier reading from handwritten notes said he had tried to steal a political sign promoting the [North] Korean peoples love for their system from the hotel The aim of my task was to harm the motivation and work ethic of the Korean people This was a very foolish aim Warmbier said He was wearing a beige jacket with a shirt and tie and was cleanshaven He appeared to be in good healthAmericans who previously have been detained in North_Korea have also been with the detainees told what to say and the reporters told what to ask After saying he had made the worst mistake of my_life as he asked for forgiveness Warmbier performed a deep bow in front of the mainly North_Korean reportersAnalysts say Warmbier was probably told what to say and how to deliver the bizarre statement in which the student said he was impressed by North_Koreas humanitarian treatment of severe criminals like myself and referred to the connivance of the United_States administrationSuch confessions which are repeatedly played on North_Korean television for domestic propaganda purposes are usually a necessary step before detainees can be releasedHowever recent detainees have had to go through a show trial and conviction before being freedWarmbiers parents Fred and Cindy have not been able to contact their son since his arrest and released a statement through U-Va in which they urged North_Korea to release himI hope the fact that he has conveyed his sincere apology for anything that he may have done wrong will now make it possible for the DPRK authorities to allow him to return home the statement said using the official acronym for North_Korea and written in the voice of Fred I urge the DPRK government to consider his youth and make an important humanitarian gesture by allowing him to return to his loved onesIn his appearance before the media Otto Warmbier said he had been instructed by a female member of Friendship United Methodist Church in Wyoming Ohio to steal one of North_Koreas ubiquitous propaganda signs and take it back to the United_States as a trophyAll across North_Korea from factories and government offices to hillsides and intersections there are propangandistic slogans lauding the ruling Kim regime which maintains power through an all-encompassing personality cult Speaking ill of the Kims or even folding a newspaper so the leaders face is halved is treasonousTaking the banner would harm the unity and motivation of the North_Korean people and show this country an insult from the West Warmbier said adding that the plan had the US governments approval The church member would give him a used car worth $10000 if he stole the sign and would pay $200000 to his mother if he was arrested in the processWarmbier said his familys very severe financial difficulties made him do it I started to consider this as my only golden opportunity to earn money he said adding that his family would not be paid if he mentioned the churchs involvementHe also said that the Z Society a student group at U-Va clandestinely encouraged my act The slogan was on a staff-only floor of the Yanggakdo hotel which is called Alcatraz by regular foreign visitors because it is situated on an island in the river that runs through Pyongyang and impossible to get off without detection He reportedly pulled the banner from the wall but realized it was too big to carry off so he abandoned it thereWarmbier was on a trip organized by one of a handful of travel companies that take The company which had previously referred to an incident at the hotel said it had nothing to add following Warmbiers statementIn Washington White_House press_secretary Josh Earnest said that the US government which does_not have diplomatic relations with North_Korea was working with the Swedish Embassy which represents American interests there on the caseAs Virginias heated gubernatorial election draws near a Democratic group on Monday released an ad featuring a pickup truck flying a Confederate flag and sporting a bumper sticker for Republican Ed Gillespie chasing a group of minority children The minute-long spot from the Latino Victory Fund ends with the children waking up from a nightmare and adults watching footage on television of torch-bearing white nationalists marching in Charlottesville Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by the American Dream the narrator says The commercial which the Latino Victory Fund says is airing through Election_Day on Spanish-language stations in Richmond and Washington market is the latest in a bitter battle on the airwaves Gillespie a longtime GOP operative has launched ads seeking to tie his Democratic opponent Ralph Northam to and a who briefly got his rights restored The Republican candidate has also launched commercials vowing to protect the states Confederate monuments and warning that Northam supports their removal Gillespies advertising has drawn a rebuke from minority advocacy groups Democrats and in recent_days from some Republicans who see it as a departure from Gillespies long-standing position that the GOP needs to reach out to nonwhite voters Northam retaliated with a blasting Gillespies commercials as false attacks and despicable He also approved a Democratic mailer who marched in Charlottesville urging voters to stand up to Trump Gillespie and hate Republicans blasted that mailer and accused Northam of exploiting the deadly violence in Charlottesville for political gain They also note that Gillespie repeatedly condemned the white supremacists of Charlottesville But Democrats have responded that Gillespies campaign has commercials have amplified stereotypes about Latinos and that the candidate never explicitly condemned President Trumps remarks that there were very fine people on both_sides during the Charlottesville conflict between neo-Nazis and counter protesters Its a very stark ad but those portrayals in the ad are what Latino and immigrant communities feel right_now in Virginia Latino Victory Fund President Cristbal J Alex said If Gillespie is successful in scapegoating Latinos and borrowing from Trumps playbook we will see those types of attacks against our community throughout the 2018 midtermsGillespie campaign_manager Chris Leavitt called the ads from the Latino Victory Fund a desperate smear campaignNow his allies have reached a new low with a disgusting vile television ad seeking to instill fear in our children with that same imagery Leavitt said This is not an attack on Ed Gillespie anymore This is an all-out attack on the people of Virginia This latest ad gives a clear indication of just what Ralph Northam and his national Democratic allies think of all of us and its sickening A Northam campaign spokeswoman expressed no misgivings about the Latino Victory Fund adIndependent groups are denouncing Ed Gillespie because he has run the most divisive fear mongering campaign in modern history said Ofirah Yheskel It is not shocking that communities of color are scared of what his Trump-like policy positions mean for themGillespie spent Sunday campaigning with US Sen Rob Portman (R-Ohio) before a diverse crowd in a Vietnamese shopping center Portman touted Gillespies moderate positions on issues of addiction and criminal justice and defended him from critics disappointed by his ad campaign Hes a Republican reformer Portman told the Post He goes everywhere hell talk to everybody I_think hell be a national leaderGerman voters on Sunday appeared to send a message to Chancellor_Angela Merkel Close the door on migrantsHer center-right Christian Democratic_Party suffered universal setbacks in local elections in a vote widely seen as a referendum on Merkels humanitarian stance allowing vast waves of migrants to cross German bordersThe upstart Alternative for Germany (AfD) party a populist force that campaigned on an anti-migrant anti-Merkel platform and which drew support from the left as well as the right scored big gains It landed 244 percent of the vote in one of the three states that went to the ballot box according to projections based on exit polls produced for the German public broadcaster ARD The outcome amounted to a blow to Merkel just as the chancellor is set to fight this week for a new accord between the European_Union and Turkey on the refugee crisis It would stop the illegal flow of migrants across the Aegean Sea but also compel reluctant European nations including Germany to take in more Syrian asylum seekers from TurkeyAt home Merkel has already vowed to speed up deportations of migrants who are not fleeing war In the past 12 months more_than a million migrants from the Middle_East and beyond have sought sanctuary and jobs in Europes economic powerhouse Yet in a sign that public tolerance may be growing thin voter turnout was up Sunday and above 70 percent in two of the states voting The results will probably further fuel the existing unease with Merkel within her own CDU said Carsten Nickel senior vice_president of Teneo IntelligenceThe CDUs worst losses of the night came in Baden-Wuerttemberg where her party was falling to 27 percent support a record low The CDU had held sway in the state for most of the post-World War_II era but ended the night down 12 percentage points from its last showingThe CDU also lost ground but less about 3 percentage points in the states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt Importantly one of the CDUs rising stars Julia Klckner was failing in her bid to unseat the incumbent for Rhineland-Palatinates top jobAt the same_time the AfD a party that sought to tap the anxiety of Germans over the wave of newcomers made strong gains The party drew voters to the polls who had rarely or never participated in elections Projections showed it winning more_than 24 percent in Saxony-Anhalt located in the former East Germany where anti-migrant sentiment is running particularly high The AfD also gained ground in the two other states with preliminary results showing it won 126 percent of the vote in Rhineland-Palatinate and 151 percent in wealthy heavily industrialized Baden-Wuerttemberg Nevertheless analysts predicted that Merkel who has defended her plan to shelter war-torn refugees while weeding out economic migrants probably would hold firm She has the luxury of claiming that key local CDU politicians including Klckner who failed on Sunday have criticized her refugee policy They lost to opposition politicians who sometimes had been more supportive of the chancellors refugee policy than members of her own partyWhen it comes to the refugee crisis Merkel might change her tone but not her politics said Jrgen Falter a political analyst at Mainz University She seems to be so utterly convinced of her strategy that I do not expect her to do anything different unless her European partners force her to Stephanie Kirchner contributed to this reportThere are three reasons the Trump dossier has been elevated as one of the central points of consideration in the public investigation of Russian_meddling in the 2016_presidential campaignThe first is that it involves the characters and language of a John Le Carr novel a former_British intelligence_officer communing with shadowy Muscovites identified only by letters and detailing secret meetings in exotic places hidden payments and illegal agreements to seize the American presidencyThe second is that the political stakes are high The dossiers roots lie with an picking up an effort begun by an unnamed Republican client in the primary but accelerated with the hiring of the Briton Christopher_Steele Steele compiled the 35-page document that was ultimately and how and why he did so has been nailed down only recentlyThe third reason people have paid so much attention to it is the unproven assertion generally described as salacious that Trump was party to a particular event in a Moscow hotel room You already know what Im referring to so I wont get into itThat assertion is unproven as are many of the other claims in the document That includes the overarching claim that Russian_government officials allied with Trump employees and campaign aides to help his election But the importance of assessing that claim has led Trump supporters to dismiss the dossier and its contents out of hand and critics of the president to lift up individual statements as accurate to suggest that the overarching claim is as wellWe decided to evaluate the claims in the dossier as best we could to guide that debate Its certainly the case that we may have missed something if so The dossier is composed of 17 company intelligence reports each assigned a number between 80 and 135 and most of which include the date the report was completed although the numeric order doesnt always match the calendar orderNote that we cant verify that the reports actually from those dates This is important because the reports do sometimes make claims that were proven to be accurate by later reporting but we dont_know that they werent written after those reports and dated priorWe do know that in late October of last_year Mother Joness David Corn having seen the dossier and its contents BuzzFeed the version we reviewed in early January Any reports after that point were clearly after the factIts also worth noting that the information included in the reports is mostly unverified humint intelligence gathered by talking to people As Wired shortly_after the dossier was published such intelligence will usually be flagged with indicators suggesting how credible the sources and claims should be considered The dossier lacks thatWriting for the National Review David Satter that the dossier also seemed to comport with the idea of Russian actors deliberately sharing information meant to position Russia in a particular wayFor referenceWe will evaluate the claims in each report individually Its critical to note that these claims are for the most part verified and should not be considered as such Dated June 20 2016 Russian President_Vladimir Putin and the Russian_government had sought to cultivate Trump for a period of five_years (that is beginning in 2011) Report suggests that Trump was offered and declined real-estate deals and that the Russians have compromising_information on both Trump and Clinton Trumps relationship with Russian interests extends back during which time he may have been contacted by Russian agents In 2011 Trump was flirting with running for president including by attacking President_Barack Obamas nativity By 2013 hed partnered with a businessman named Aras Agalarov to host the Miss_Universe pageant in Moscow It was Agalarov and his son Emin who were later the vehicle for orchestrating a meeting between a Kremlin-backed lawyer and Donald Trump Jr at Trump_Tower in June 2016Theres no_evidence at hand that this cultivation took_place however The dossier claims a carrot-and-stick approach to keeping Trump in line with the carrot being those real_estate deals and the stick being the salacious event Subsequent reporting though indicates that Trump Organization lawyer Michael Cohen (whose name will come up again) Putin aide Dmitry Peskov (whose name also will come up again) in January 2016 to ask for help in advancing a project in the capital The deal collapsed undercutting the idea that six months later Russia would have claimed to be trying to bolster Trumps efforts in the cityThe report also suggests that the compromising_information on Clinton was mostly in the form of recordings of comments made while traveling in Russia (This information is said to be controlled by Peskov per the report) By this time hackers believed to be tied to the Russian_government already had network and the email of Clinton campaign_chairman information that was discussed in later reports Neither is mentioned in this report from late June before either set of hacked documents was released via WikiLeaks Dated July 19 2016 Trump campaign aide Carter_Page met with thechief executive of fossil-fuel giant Rosneft Igor Sechin and Kremlin official Igor Diveykin who American officials was in charge of collecting intelligence about the campaign Diveykin again raised the compromising material about Clinton with Page Page was in Moscow in early July a trip that was reported at the time He denied meeting Sechin or Diveykin This report suggests that Diveykin offered to release the compromising_information on Clinton to Trumps campaign team an offer that we now know was made before that June meeting in Trump_Tower as well Its not clear why Diveykin would make this offer after having already had the opportunity to release that information to Donald Trump Jr a month earlier Undated An ethnic Russian close associate of Trump says theres a conspiracy of cooperating between the campaign and Moscow The source says that Russia hacked the DNC and leaked the files to WikiLeaks to maintain plausible deniabilityTrumps team had repaid Russia by sidelining Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue and questioning NATOs commitments in the BalticsThe migr claimed a tripartite group of actors Firstly there were agents/facilitators within the Democratic_Party structure itself secondly Russian migr and associated offensive cyber operators based in the US and thirdly state-sponsored cyberoperatives working in Russia Diplomatic staff in several cities were using the migr pension distribution system as cover for communicating with RussiaThe report claimed that Trump had sought a real_estate deal in St Petersburg as well and that the campaign was comfortable with attention being focused on Russia because it distracted the media from business_dealings in China and other emerging markets that included bribes and kickbacks Its not clear when this report was written but the contents and context suggest that it is from late JulyEmails from the DNC were published on WikiLeaks on July 22 but some files were published by Guccifer 20 in mid-June Before any files were released The Washington_Post had Russian actors as the likely culprits Its unlikely then that an outside observer wouldnt have known what the migr claimed about the hacksBy late July Trump had already NATOs role The_Post also had already on the Trump campaigns efforts to remove language from the party platform at the convention that would have bolstered Ukraine in its fight with RussiaThe overarching assertion in this report is the most important one That Trumps team and Russian actors were colluding This too hasnt been proven and its not clear the extent to which the investigations of that collusion that we know exist were spurred by the dossier itselfIts hard to evaluate the other claims made above but its clear that Trump did seek business deal in St Petersburg (perhaps including a reality show) There also has been reporting by the New_Yorker on projects in and that may have raised questions about possible bribery and corruption Dated July 26 2016 Russia has an extensive program aimed_at hacking foreign adversaries Some examples are provided that dont seem to be related to what_happened to 2016 That the Russians were actively hacking Westerners is clearly true and was well-known even before the electionAlthough its not clear how the DNC servers were accessed it doesnt seem to have been through the means described in this report Podestas email was hacked using which isnt mentioned in this report Dated July 30 2016 The Russian_government was nervous about the attention paid to its role in leaking information specifically the DNC emailsThe report also claims that Trump and his associates had for at_least eight years been providing Russia with intelligence on the activities business and otherwise in the US of leading Russian oligarchs and their families Sourced to a Russian migr figure close to Trump the report claims that the Kremlin had more intelligence on Clinton but didnt know when it might be released This could be a reference to the Podesta emails that were released in OctoberWe also fall into what might be called the Nostradamus trap Retrofitting what we know now to what was written about beforehand The vagueness of more intelligence makes it hard to say this is a description of the Podesta hackIts also not clear how or if Trump did (or could have) provided Moscow with information on oligarchs Dated Aug 5 2016 Details internal dissension in Russia over blowback from the intervention efforts Sergei Ivanov Putins chief of staff is reported to be angry about the intervention efforts of Peskov and others This report is largely inconsequential for our purposes Dated Aug 10 2016 Similar to Report 100 this document mostly details internal dynamics It also asserts that no new leaks [were] envisaged as too politically risky but rather further exploitation of (WikiLeaks) material already disseminated to exacerbate divisions The goal of the existing leaks was to turn educated youth against Clinton and toward TrumpThe Kremlin was also reaching out to other political figures funding trips to Moscow Those figures included Green Party candidate Jill Stein Michael T Flynn and Carter_Page Russia had already accessed Podestas email by this point according to US authorities so this report seems to be claiming that those emails would not be releasedOtherwise this information was already known Young voters were more skeptical of Clinton than others as evidenced by the already-concluded Democratic primary Flynn (an adviser to Trump) and Stein visited Moscow for RTs 10-year anniversary a visit that was Pages visit is discussed above Dated Aug 10 2016 This report focuses on the same ethnic Russian associate of Trumps and largely discusses what the campaign hoped to do (such as turning young voters against Clinton) This report is largely inconsequential for our purposes Dated Aug 22 2016 Former Ukrainian president Viktor_Yanukovych told Putin that hed paid Trump campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort under the table but that it was untraceable Report cites a Trump associate claiming that the revelation of those payments was part of why Manafort left the campaign (as he did shortly before the reports publishing date) and part was pressure from former campaign_manager Corey_Lewandowski The role of the alleged payments was as a reason for Manaforts ouster The tension between him and Lewandowski was not unknown and neither was the fact that Lewandowski still spoke with Trump regularly Dated Sep 14 2016 The Russians have further compromising material about Clinton described as emails that they are considering disseminating after the Russian legislative elections in late SeptemberChief of staff Ivanov was fired which the report suggests was because of the advice he gave Putin on the issue of election intervention The report says that a diplomat was also removed from the Washington embassy because of possible exposure from his role in the meddling The claim about the emails is significant offering one of the few indicators that Steele uncovered the existence of the Podesta hack before it became public (The emails were published in early October) The vagueness of the description of the material though might also be a reference to some other batch of informationIvanovs was reported as a power struggle Putin described it publicly as having been the natural conclusion of Ivanovs term of serviceThe question of the ousted diplomat is interesting Steele writes his name as Mikhail Kulagin In August Mikhail after six years in DC a move that doesnt appear to have been reported at the timeIt was widely reported that US intelligence officials had verified Steeles claim about Kalugin that he was an intelligence_officer Whether he was withdrawn for involvement in meddling though is not clear Dated Sep 14 2016 Deals with a business relationship involving Putin This report is largely inconsequential for our purposes Dated Sep 14 2016 Asserts that Trump paid bribes for possible business deals in St Petersburg a claim that Agalarov could verify As mentioned above Trump did seek set in the city Other business_dealings are unclear Dated Oct 12 2016 Russia had injected further anti-Clinton material into the plausibly deniable leaks pipeline that would keep emerging Putin was angry about how the operation was progressing though his administration had assumed direct control to the extent that Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrovs job might be at risk By Oct 12 the Podesta emails were dripping out WikiLeaks the pipeline apparently used for the DNC hacks as well was regularly and would continue to do so That a number of releases had already occurred would be known to most outside observersThe report indicates that the effort to intervene on behalf of Trump originated with Lavrovs department and eventually made its way to Putins team directly This comports with about Putin having a direct hand in the effort That said Lavrov still holds his position Dated Oct 18 2016 One of the more significant reports it again asserts that Page met with Rosneft chief_executive Sechin in July At the meeting Sechin offered Page and Trump a 19 percent stake in Rosneft in exchange for lifting sanctions on Russia if electedIt also asserts that Cohen Trumps lawyer was playing a key role in the Russia-Trump relationship The Rosneft claim received a lot of attention when in January a 195 percent stake in the company was sold to Later reporting though indicated that the buyers were It was essentially a loan and Moscow prearranged to buy back some of the company from the QatarisThat said Trump did seek to quickly on Russia imposed after the country seized Crimea in 2014More on Cohen below Dated Oct 19 2016 The report claims that Cohen played an important role liaising between Trumps team and Moscow including meeting with Russian agents to cover up Manaforts involvement in Ukraine and Pages interactions with the Russians More below Dated Oct 20 2016 Claims that Cohen traveled to Prague at some point in August to coordinate the relationship There he met with Russian agents at an agency that distributes foreign aid Cohen has repeatedly any such meeting saying that his one trip to Europe in 2016 was a July trip to Italy backed up by He also says that he was in California for the last_week of August with his sonThere has been no_evidence presented to place Cohen in Prague Dated Dec 13 2016 Cohens trip to Prague included three colleagues and centered on how to clean up the evidence of collusion including determining how to make final payments from both Russia and Trump to hackersThe report also outlined that an unidentified company and its affiliates had been using botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses plant bugs steal data and conduct altering operations against the Democratic party leadership If Clinton won the presidency the plan was to pay off the Romanian hackers and have other participants head to Bulgaria to lay low Again theres no_evidence Cohen was in Prague This report claims that he was there during that last_week in August or early September USC confirmed Cohens visit during that first period to While its not clear how the DNC server was accessed we do know that the Podesta emails were obtained through a phishing attempt not by leveraging botnets porn or bugsThe Steele dossier makes a wide range of claims many of which are rumors that couldnt be independently verified Many other claims involve things that would have been publicly known at the time the report was apparently drafted Although its impossible to say that the dossier is entirely inaccurate (there are some glimmers of accurate predictions) it is also impossible to say that it has been broadly validatedThat unsatisfying answer has a side effect It gives either side of the political fight all the ammo that it might wantGeorge Washington wanted a little adviceIt was 1789 he had just become the president of the newly minted United_States of America and he was about to issue the nations first executive_order except it was more of an executive he asked the heads of various federal departmentsto impress me with a full precise and distinct general idea of the affairs of the United StatesThere were a lot of affairs Washington was trying to grow almost from scratch a centralized federal government in a nation full of people who had just rebelled against a central authorityThe first president needed to decide whether to tax wealthy businessmen who had helped fund the American Revolution or a growing middle class looking for an economic foothold England and France were headed toward warWashington wanted his advisers to help him get a handle on the country he was leading before they started making policyIt will be much easier to commence the administration upon a well-adjusted system built on tenable grounds than to correct errors or alter inconveniences after they shall have been confirmed by habit he wrote to Vice_President John Adams a month earlier Now 228 years later historians wonder whether President Trump could take a history lesson from Washingtons first executive_order (Such actionswerent officially called executive_orders until Abraham Lincolns presidency according to Kenneth R Mayer a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin at Madison But the concept was essentially the same)Trump has signed more_than 10 executive_orders during his first few weeks in office that are intended to crack down on crime and violence in AmericaThere have also been executive_orders to address health_care ethics financial regulations and infrastructureSigning orders to move_forward with the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines in the Oval_Office Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Some of Trumps executive_orders and actions have of course been more controversial than othersA week into his term Trump signed which from seven majority-Muslim nationsDays later the acting attorney_general questioned the legality of the order and told Justice_Department lawyers not to defend it The legality of the ban has been debated in federal court On Thursdayin a unanimous that triggered an angry response from a president of lateSEE YOU IN COURT THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Earlier a froze federal hiring But shortly afterward the freeze was criticized because it disproportionately hurt veterans who receive preference in federal jobsTrumps executive actions have come at a rapid clip which is to be expected said Mayerthe political science professorA new president works quickly to assert his authority_over the federal government Mayer said in an interview What is unusual is the scope of what Trump has tried to do and frankly the casualness with which these orders have come outThey were not properly vettedOne of the reasons the immigration order was struck down Mayer said is because it was so sloppily executedIn some cases federal agencies charged with enforcing the new administrations executive_orders say they were blindsidedThe departments of homeland security and state seem to be learning about things after the fact said Cristina Rodrguez a constitutional law professor at Yale I dont_think weve seen anything like this before Its a disregard for reality the desire to bypass agencies altogether Government fact-finding has grown more complex as the executive branch has expanded Rodrguez told The PostWhen Washington assumed the presidency he didnt have senior advisers a modern president wouldnt need an executive_order to find out details of a policy proposalStill its uncommon for a president not to vet executive_orders with the agencies that would have to carry them out she saidIts necessary in a different way now because society is much more complex and government has a much broader reach Rodrguez said You probably need greater expertise and people have been specialized in a way that they may not have had in [Washingtons] timeAs The Fixs Basically an executive_order is an official statement from the president about how the federal agencies he oversees are touse their resourcesIt falls under the broader umbrella of executive actionswhich derive their power fromArticle II of the Constitution and it is the most formal executive action Executive actions also include presidential memorandums (which are a step below executive_orders and basically outline the administrations position on a policy issue) proclamations and directivesAn executive orderis not the president creating new law or appropriating new money from the US Treasury both things that are the domain of Congress it is the president instructing the government how it is to work within the parameters that are already set by Congress and the ConstitutionTrumps for example basically establishes building the wall as a federal priority and directs the Department of Homeland_Security to use already-available funding to get the ball rolling on its constructionThe presidents executive_orders are recorded in the Federal Register and are considered binding but they are subject to legal reviewIn his explainer Blake noted that executive_orders have often been the subject of controversy with the opposition party accusing the president of overstepping his authority and acting like a dictator Basically theyre arguing that hes the law rather_than working within itPresidents can blunt some of that criticism by consulting which has benefitsbeyond merely getting things right according to a historian who has written extensively about American life after the Revolutionary WarThe conversations before the orders show that the executive branch is listening to the people paid to advise the president and to the people he represents That desire dates back to the years before the RevolutionAmericans had a paranoid fear of a dictator that was the terrifying fear that lurked in every Americans heart Fleming told The_Post Washington was aware of that and thats something Trump needs to learnHes much too in love with these executive_orders and acting solo without any advice Thats the way you show the people that the government is acting in the best interest of the people that its actually representing themSpecial counsel_Robert S_Mueller III on Monday former Trump campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort and his longtime business_partner Rick_Gates as well as charges_against former Trump foreign_policy adviser_George Papadopoulos who pleaded_guilty earlier_this monthThe developments stem from asweeping investigation Muelleris conducting into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence US politicsPapadopoulos a Trump campaign volunteer made false_statements to FBI officials earlier_this year when asked about contacts he had with a foreign professor according to the The contact claimed to have high-level Russian connections that could provide dirt on then-candidate Hillary_Clinton in the form of thousands of emails and arrange a meeting between Trump campaign officials and Russian leaders all the way up to President_Vladimir PutinMany of the which include money_laundering and tax fraud relate to alleged crimes that predate either of the political operatives joiningthe Trump campaignThey primarily involve the concealment of millions of dollars they made while working on behalf of apro-Putin political party in UkraineAccording to the indictment the duo also obscured the fact that they were working for a foreign government anddid not register under the Foreign_Agents Registration_Act as required by law Manafort and Gates both pleaded not guilty on Monday Who are the Ukrainians and Russians for whom Manaforts firm worked And what impact might scrutiny of those connections have on Muellers wider probe That story in condensed form below starts in 2005After gaining prominence working as a political consultant in Washington for major figures including presidents Gerald Ford Ronald_Reagan and George HW Bush Manaforts star faded and hefound work for authoritarian leaders in the Philippines Zaire and elsewhere In 2005 Manafort was hired by a Ukrainian steel magnate who wanted to burnish his international imageAkhmetovs company was based in a heavily industrialized mostly Russian-speaking part of eastern Ukraine He was one of a large group of Ukrainian oligarchs with close ties to the leader of the Russia-friendly Party of Regions Manafort was hired by the political party soon thereafterManafort provided image consulting to Yanukovych and members of his party during the parliamentary elections of 2006 and 2007 seeking to soften the edges of politicians from the rough industrial cities in Ukraines southeast wrote my colleagues at The Washington_Post last August when Ukrainian showing $127millionin apparent payments to Manafort between 2007 and 2012 by Yanukovychs partyHe got Yanukovych to comb his hair better to stay on message during public appearances and to adopt the kind of sharp rhetoric that had worked so well for Manaforts mentor Republican strategist Lee Atwater they wrote He drilled them on talking_points and told them what suits to wearYanukovych was successfully elected president in 2010 In those early years in Eastern Europe Manafort also worked on projects with a who was then one of the worlds richest men Despite rocky patches in their business relationship Manafort Deripaska weekly briefings on the 2016 US presidential_election while serving as Trumps campaign_chairman Manaforts firm did_not just work with Yanukovych on domestic politics Its lobbying on Yanukovychs behalf in Western capitals is why the lack of Foreign_Agents Registration_Act compliance is mentioned in Muellers indictmentIn Washington Manafort worked to promote Yanukovych as a pro-Western democrat But in 2014 Yanukovych was deposed by a popular uprising fueled by anger at his alleged corruption authoritarianism and preference for Putin over the European_Union Yanukovych fled to Russia and is wanted in Ukraine on charges of high treasonThe Post has that Ukrainian business records_show that Manaforts firm did_not close his business operations in the country until April_2016 the month after he joined the Trump campaign (though two months before he become its chairman)Manaforts connections in the region and their tendency to align with pro-Russian interests made his appointment as Trumps campaign_chairman all the more controversial Reporting on the nature of those tiesbecame clearer just as Trump was beginning to make more and more pro-Russian comments on the campaign_trail Democratic opponents became vocal about collusion allegations between Trumps campaign and the Kremlin Manaforts position became increasingly untenableand he was asked to resign in August 2016Former campaign adviser has been thrust into a national spotlight after he pleaded_guilty tolying to federal investigators amid a probe into possible Russian influence in US political affairsPapadopoulos pleaded_guilty this month to lying about his involvement with people he understood had connections to the Russian governmentAs The Washington Postscourt documents released Monday show that Papadopoulos met withan unnamed overseas professor in Italy in March_2016 That same month he was nameda foreign_policy adviser to the Trump campaign According to the court_documents Papadopoulos also reported back to campaign officials about his attempts to set_up meetings between the campaign and the Russian governmentSo who is George_Papadopoulos the man an excellent guy The proposal sent a ripple of concern through campaign headquarters in Trump_Tower Campaign co-chairman Sam_Clovis wrote that he thought NATO_allies should be consulted before any plans were made Another Trump adviser retired Navy Rear Adm Charles Kubic cited legal concerns including a possible violation of US sanctions against Russia and of the Logan Act which prohibits US citizens from unauthorized negotiation with foreign governmentsBut Papadopoulos a campaign volunteer with scant foreign_policy experience persisted Between March and September [2016] the self-described energy consultant sent at_least a half-dozen requests for Trump as he turned from primary candidate to party nominee or for members of his team to meet with Russian officials Among those to express concern about the effort was then-campaign chairman_Paul Manafort who rejected in May 2016 a proposal from Papadopoulos for Trump to do soWhite House_press secretary_Sarah HuckabeeSanders said Monday that Papadopouloss guilty plea has nothing to do with his campaign activities only his failure to be honest about themIt was extremely limitedSanders told_reporters during a news briefing aboutPapadopouloss role in the campaign It was a volunteer positionIn June a Belarusan American businessman who goes by the name Sergei Millian shared some tantalizing claims about Donald TrumpTrump had a long-standing relationship with Russian officials Millian told an associate and those officials were now feeding Trump damaging_information about his Democratic opponent Hillary_Clinton Millian said that the information provided to Trump had been very helpfulUnbeknownst to Millian however his conversation was not confidential His associate passed on what he had heard to a former_British intelligence_officer who had been hired by Trumps political opponents to gather information about the Republicans ties to RussiaThe allegations by Millian whose role was first reported by the Wall_Street Journal and has been confirmed by The Washington_Post were central to the dossier compiled by the former spy Christopher_Steele While the dossier has not been verified and its claims have been denied by Trump Steeles document said that Millians assertions had been corroborated by other sources including in the Russian_government and former intelligence sourcesThe most explosive allegation that the dossier says originally came from Millian is the claim that Trump had hired prostitutes at the Moscow Ritz-Carlton and that the Kremlin has kept evidence of the encounterBy his own evolving statements Sergei Millian is either a shrewd businessman with high-level access to both Trumps inner circle and the Kremlin or a bystander unwittingly caught up in a global controversyAn examination of Millians career shows he is a little of both His case lays bare the challenge facing the FBI as it investigates Russias alleged attempts to manipulate the American political system and whether Trump associates participatedIt also illustrates why the Trump administration remains unable to shake the Russia story While some of the unproven claims attributed in the dossier to Millian are bizarre and outlandish there are also indications that he had contacts with Trumps circleMillian told several people that during the campaign and presidential transition he was in touch with George_Papadopoulos a campaign foreign_policy adviser according to a person_familiar with the matter Millian is among Papadopouloss nearly 240 Facebook friends Trump aides vehemently reject Millians claims to have had close contact with Trump or high-level access to the presidents company Millian did_not answer a list of detailed questions about his interactions with Trump and his role in the Steele dossier instead responding by email with lengthy general defenses of Trumps election as Gods will and complaining that inquiries about his role are evidence of a witch_hunt and McCarthyismAny falsifications deceit and baseless allegations directed against any US President is damaging to the national_security interests of the United_States he wrote in one email Publishing slanderous stories about the Presidents decency and offensive material about the first family is malicious propaganda and a threat to the national_security in order to destabilize the integrity of the United_States of America and stir civil disorder aiming at reducing its political influence in the worldIn late January Millian appeared on Russian television where he denied knowing information that could be damaging to Trump I want to say that I dont have any compromising_information neither in Russia nor in the United_States nor could I have he said speaking in Russian Without a doubt it is a blatant lie and an effort of some people its definitely a group of people to portray our president in a bad light using my nameThe dossier decried by Trump as phony stuff and fake_news and derided by Russian President_Vladimir Putin as rubbish consists of a series of reports compiled by Steele over the course of several months before the electionMillian identified in different portions of the dossier as Source D and Source E is described as a close associate of TrumpIn addition to the salacious allegations that gained widespread attention the dossier attributed other claims to Millian For_instance Steele wrote that Millian asserted that there was a well developed conspiracy of cooperation between [Trump] and Russian leadership claiming the relationship was managed for Trump by former campaign_chairman Paul_Manafort A Manafort spokesman said every word in the dossier about Paul_Manafort is a lieSome of those who know Millian described him as more of a big-talking schmoozer than a globe-trotting interlocutor They say hes a self-promoter with a knack for getting himself on television like the time he appeared on a 2013 episode of the Bravo reality show Million Dollar Listing where he attempted to broker a sale with a Russian-speaking client who agreed to pay $7million in cash for a luxury New_York unitHes an opportunist If he sees an opportunity he would go after it said Tatiana Osipova who was a neighbor of Millians when he lived in Atlanta and who in 2006 helped him found a trade group the Russian American_Chamber of Commerce in the USA Osipova now lives in St Petersburg but has remained in touch with Millian Hes a fun guy a smart guy But always talking He talks so much s---Millians original name was Siarhei Kukuts but those who know him say he changed it because he wanted something that sounded more elegant He told ABC News in July that he changed his name to honor his grandmother whose last name he said was Millianovich He has also at times gone by the name Sergio MillianMy general impression of him was that he just wanted to be important Nobody really knew what he or the chamber were doing but he presented himself with grandeur said Nadia Diskavets a New_York photographer who was also a founding member of the Russian American_Chamber of Commerce but has not been in touch with Millian recently So I always took everything he said with a grain of saltAnother acquaintance referred to him in a similar way saying he exaggerated his connections with Trump and with the Russians Hes too small of a fish to deal with Russian people she said They will smell his smallness from miles awayBorn in Belarus Millian 38 attended a university in Minsk A Russian-language version of his biography that was posted on the Russian American_Chamber of Commerces website says he studied to be a military translatorHe arrived in the early 2000s as a young single professional in Atlanta which has a large Russian-speaking community Friends there said he worked in real_estate and according to one rsum posted online he opened a translating business whose clients included the Russian Ministry of Foreign AffairsFriends said that Millian founded the Russian American_Chamber of Commerce as a way to forge business ties between the United_States and Russia and as a personal networking opportunityMillians affiliation with the group also appears to have boosted his profile in Russia He hosted events in the United_States and abroad on the chambers behalf and after moving to New_York began being interviewed repeatedly by Russian-language news outlets as an expert on US-Russia relations He traveled to Moscow in 2011 courtesy of a Russian_government cultural group later investigated by the FBI for allegedly recruiting spies though there is no_evidence that the inquiry involved Millian Millians account of his relationship with Trump has shifted over time As the Republican candidate was rising in the spring of 2016 a time before there was close scrutiny of Trumps ties to Russia Millian used his media appearances to describe deep connections with the New_York real_estate mogulHe told the Russian state-operated news_agency RIA Novosti last April for instance that he met Trump at a Miami horse-racing track after mutual associates had organized a trip for Trump to Moscow in 2007From there Millian said he entered into a business arrangement in which he says he helped market a Trump-branded condominium complex in Hollywood Fla to international investors including RussiansMillians description of the Miami event appears to match up with a picture he posted on Facebook that appears to show him posing with Trump and the projects developer Jorge Prez the only evidence that Millian ever met TrumpA spokesman for Prez said his company has no record of paying Millian in connection with the project and Prez declined to comment furtherA White_House spokeswoman said Sergei Millian is one of hundreds of thousands of people the president has had his picture made with but they do not know one anotherMillian however promoted ties he claimed to hold with Trumps companyA 2009 newsletter posted to the website of the Russian American_Chamber of Commerce reported that the group had signed formal agreements with the Trump Organization and Prezs company to jointly service the Russian clients commercial residential and industrial real_estate needsIn the interview with RIA Novosti Millian boasted that when he was in New_York Trump introduced him to his right-hand man Michael Cohen a longtime Trump adviser a claim that Cohen has deniedHe is the chief attorney of Trump through whom all contracts have to go Millian told the Russian news outlet adding I was involved in the signing of a contract to promote Trumps real_estate projects in RussiaYou can say that I was their exclusive broker Millian continued in Russian Back then in 2007-2008 Russians by the dozens were buying apartments in Trumpsbuildings in the USAAsked in the April interview how often he spoke to Trump or his associates Millian responded The last time was several days agoMillian told people last_year that he was in touch with Papadopoulos whom Trump had described in a March_2016 Washington_Post editorial board interview as a member of his foreign_policy team and an excellent guy Papadopoulos received attention during the campaign largely because of reports that he had exaggerated his rsum and cited among his accomplishments that he had participated in a Model United_Nations program for college and graduate studentsBut according to foreign news reports and officials he conducted a number of high-level meetings last_year and presented himself as a representative of the Trump campaign He told a group of researchers in Israel that Trump saw Putin as a responsible actor and potential partner according to a column in the Jerusalem Post while later he met with a British Foreign Office representative in London an embassy spokesman said He also criticized US sanctions on Russia in an interview with the Russian news outlet InterfaxPapadopoulos did_not respond to questions about contacts with Millian But Papadopoulos said by email that his public comments during the campaign reflected his own opinions and that some of his energy policy views run counter to Russian interests No one from the campaign ever directed me to discuss talking_points he said In a separate email he accused The_Post of relying on innuendo and unsubstantiated claims by irrelevant sourcesNeither Millian nor a White_House spokeswoman responded to questions about Papadopoulos The person_familiar with the contacts who spoke on the condition of anonymity did_not provide details Over the summer as Trump prepared to accept the Republican presidential nomination Millian traveled to Russia He posted pictures on his Facebook page showing that he attended a Russian government-sponsored summit in St Petersburg in June One photograph shows him with Russias minister for energy Another shows him chatting with Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska who is close to Putin A spokeswoman for Deripaska declined to comment A spokesman for the Russian Embassy did_not respond to questions about MillianLater in the summer Millian continued boasting of his Trump connectionsHe told ABC News that he had been the official broker for the Trump-branded condo building and described Trumps affinity for working with Russians He pointed to hundreds of millions of dollars that [Trump] received from interactions with Russian businessmenMillian added that Trump likes Russia because he likes beautiful Russian ladies talking to them of course And he likes to be able to make lots of money with RussiansMillian told ABC that he was absolutely not involved with Russian intelligence But when asked whether he had heard rumors to that effect Millian replied Yes of courseMillian also said that at times he talked about US politics with top Russian officials Usually if I meet top people in the Russian_government they invite me say to the Kremlin for the reception of course I have a chance to talk to some presidential advisers and some top people Millian saidWhile Cohen has said he has never met Millian the two did interact last_year over Twitter Millian was for a time one of about 100 people that Cohen followed and they tweeted at each other on one occasion in August after Cohen appeared on televisionCohen later unfollowed Millian telling The_Post that he had mistakenly thought Millian was related to a Trump Organization employee with a similar last nameHe is a total phony Cohen said in an interview Anything coming out of this individuals mouth is inaccurate and purely part of some deranged interest in having his name in the newspaperCohen said he did_not believe Trump was in Russia in 2007 as Millian claimed in AprilCohen said it was possible that like other brokers in Florida Millian might have attempted to sell units at Trump Hollywood But he said Millian never held an exclusive deal at the project or any contract with the Trump OrganizationSpeaking with The_Post over the phone from his New_York office in a January interview Cohen also read aloud from a lengthy email he said Millian had sent him shortly before the election that contradicted his earlier public statementsI met Mr Trump once long time ago in 2008 pretty much for a photo opportunity and a brief talk as part of my marketing work for Trump Hollywood after my brokering service was signed Now to say that I have substantial ties is total nonsense Cohen said reading from an email he said Millian wrote after media coverage that mentioned himIn the email Millian suggested holding a news_conference to clear up the matter Cohen said Cohen said he rejected the idea accusing Millian via email of seeking media attention off of this false narrative of a Trump-Russia alliance despite having met Trump only one time for a 10 second photo opCohen who left his job at the Trump Organization in January to become Trumps personal attorney said this month that he could not release a copy of Millians email because he no_longer has access to the companys email systemIn South Florida where Millian claimed to have had a contract to sell units at Trump Hollywood there is little evidence that he played a major roleDaniel Lebensohn whose company BH3 took over for the Related Group in 2010 after Prezs company struggled to complete the project said his companys records_show no sign that Millian sold any units in the buildingTwo Florida-based real_estate brokers who specialize in the Russian market and have sold units in Trump Hollywood were equally mystifiedIve never heard of him said Olga Mirer who has traveled back and forth to Russia over the past decade brokering deals at Trump Hollywood and other Florida buildingsDespite the Trump teams efforts to distance the president from Millian the dossier source nevertheless attended Trumps inauguration in JanuaryHe posted photos of himself on Facebook attending VIP events for supporters including one in which he posed in front of the podium at a reception for Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus at Trumps Washington hotel A White_House official did_not address a question about Millians attendance Alice_Crites in Washington and David_Filipov in Moscow contributed to this reportNewly released court_documents show that Trump foreign_policy adviser_George Papadopoulos communicated with several senior campaign officials about his outreach to the Russian_government over a period of months The recipients of Papadopouloss emails are not named in the filings but The Washington_Post has identified several individuals based on interviews and other documents Papadopoulos this month to lying to federal agents about his outreach to Russia Victoria Toensing an attorney for Sam_Clovis confirmed that several references in court_filings to the campaign supervisor refer to the onetime radio_host from Iowa who served_as Trumps national campaign co-chairmanAt one point Papadopoulos_emailed Clovis and other campaign officials about a March 24 2016 meeting he had in London with a professor who had introduced him to the Russian_ambassador and a Russian woman he described as Putins_niece The group had talked about arranging a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss US-Russia ties under President Trump Papadopoulos wrote (Papadopoulos later learned that the woman was not Putins_niece and while he expected to meet the ambassador he never did according to filings)Clovis responded that he would work it through the campaign adding great work according to court documentsIn August 2016 Clovis responded to efforts by Papadopoulos to organize an off the record meeting with Russian officials I would encourage you and another foreign_policy adviser to the campaign to make the trip if it is feasible Clovis wroteToensing said Clovis always vigorously opposed any Russian trip for Donald Trump and/or the campaign She said his responses to Papadopoulos were courtesy by a polite gentleman from Iowa Emails previously described to The_Post indicate that the high-ranking campaign official described in court_documents is onetime campaign_manager Corey_Lewandowski The emails were among more_than 20000 pages that the Trump campaign turned over to congressional_committees after review by White_House and defense lawyersLewandowski who was pushed out of his post in June_2016 did_not respond to requests for commentPapadopoulos wrote to Lewandowski several times to let him know that the Russians were interested in forging a relationship with the campaign court_filings showIn one email on April 27 2016 Papadopoulos wrote to discuss Russias interest in hosting Mr TrumpHave been receiving a lot of calls over the last_month about Putin wanting to host him and the team when the time is right he addedIn May Papadopoulos forwarded to Lewandowski an offer of cooperation from a Russian with links to the Ministry of Foreign_Affairs Is this something we want to move_forward with he askedThere is no indication if or how Lewandowski responded to those messages But in June when Papadopoulos_emailed him again about Russia Lewandowski referred him to Clovis because he is running point according to court_documents The court_filings indicate that Papadopoulos_emailed another high-ranking campaign official on May 21 2016 with the subject line Request from Russia to meet Mr TrumpThe Post has previously identified this official as Paul_Manafort who was indicted Monday on unrelated criminal chargesManafort forwarded Papadopouloss email to another campaign official stating We_need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips referring to a trip to Russia It should be someone low_level in the campaign so as not to send any signalManafort spokesman Jason Maloni in Augustthat the campaign chairmans response indicated that any invitation by Russia directly or indirectly would be rejected outright The_Post has previously identified the official who received the May 21 2016 email from Manafort as his deputy_Rick Gates Gates was indicted Monday on unrelated criminal charges The court_filings indicate that on April 27 2016 Papadopoulos_emailed a senior policy advisor and wrote Have some interesting messages coming in from Moscow about a trip when the time is rightThe Post has not identified this official Court filings indicate that Clovis told Papadopoulos that he would encourage him and another foreign_policy adviser to the campaign to make a trip to meet with Russian officials if is feasible Emails previously reviewed by the Post show that the other person to whom Clovis was referring was Trump foreign_policy adviser Walid Phares who has worked as a Fox_News commentatorRebecca Bynum a spokeswoman for Phares said Phares had met Papadopoulos only once at a March 31 2016 meeting of Trumps national_security advisers a group that included both men She said Phares never traveled with Papadopoulos did_not have any conversations with him about making such trips and had been unaware until this week that Clovis had mentioned his name I_think Clovis was just trying to get [Papadopoulos] out of his hair she said According to emails previously described to The_Post the London-based professor who was a key contact for Papadopoulos in his Russian outreach is who formerly served_as a government official in MaltaMifsud did_not respond to a request for comment Monday In an email to The_Post in August he wrote that he had absolutely no contact with the Russian_government and said his only ties to Russia were through academic linksPapadopoulos met Mifsud in March_2016 while traveling in Italy according to court records The professor seemed uninterested in Papadopoulos until he learned that he was a campaign adviser according to court filingsFive days after Trump named Papadopoulos as one of his advisers during a meeting at The_Post Papadopoulos and Mifsud met in London The professor brought with him a Russian woman who was introduced as a relative of President_Vladimir Putin who had connections to senior Russian_government officialsThe following month Mifsud told Papadopoulos that he had just returned from Moscow where he had learned from high-level Russian_government officials that Russia had dirt on Democratic presidential_candidate Hillary_Clinton including thousands of emails Court documents_show that Papadopoulos corresponded with a female Russian national whom he initially believed was Putins nieceAt one point she wrote to him The Russian Federation would love to welcome [Trump] once his candidature would be officially announcedThe Post has not identified the woman In April_2016 Mifsud introduced Papadopoulos over email to a man in Moscow who told Papadopoulos that he had connections to the Russian Ministry of Foreign_Affairs court records showEmails previously described to The_Post indicate that the man is Ivan Timofeev a program director at a Russian government-funded think_tank called the Russian International_Affairs CouncilPapadopoulos communicated via Skype and email with Timofeev to discuss establishing ties between Russian officials and the Trump campaignOn Monday Timofeev declined to comment referring a reporter to a statement the Russian International_Affairs Council posted in August in response to a Post story The statement said that Papadopoulos had contacted the council and put forth the idea of a possible visit to Russia by Mr Trump or his team membersGiven the RIACs established practice of hosting public meetings with prominent politicians and public figures from the US and other countries the US initiative was a matter of routine for the Council the statement said pointing out that among the councils guest speakers was former US ambassador Michael McFaulTimofeev told The_Post in August that the idea of a meeting with Trump officials was dropped after he received no official request from the Trump campaign for a meeting David_Filipov in Moscow Karla_Adam in London and Tom Hamburger and Robert Costa in Washington contributed to this reportGiven how angry Beijing gets about THAAD you may be forgiven for thinking that the US missile system deployed to South_Korea is primarily aimed_at China However Washington and Seoul have justified the system by saying it is necessary to defend South_Korea from North_Korean aggressionWith the missile system finally being deployed and tensions between the Koreas and China exploding again heres a guide to the controversyThe acronym stands forTerminal High_Altitude Area_Defense The ground-based missile_defense system which first came into development after the Persian Gulf War is designed to shoot down short- medium- and intermediate-range ballistic_missiles during the terminal phase (ie when they are coming down)According to the US company that manufacturers the system there are four stages to its operation First a radar system identifies the incoming threat then the target is identified and engaged An interceptor is fired from a truck-mounted launcher which destroysthe missile using kinetic energy Because the incoming missile is destroyed at a high altitude the effects of weapons of mass destruction can be mitigated with the deviceThe system is designed to be highly mobile and it consists of four main components atruck-mounted launcher eight interceptors on the launcher a transportable radar system and a fire control system that links the various components with external command centersTHAAD systems have been deployedin a number of places around the world including Guam and Hawaii However last_year the Defense Department announced it would deploy a system to where it would be operated by US forces stationed in the country In a statement the Pentagon described the move as a defensive measure against North_Korea after the country continued to pursue nuclear_weapons and tested a number of ballistic_missile systemsThis week the situation on the Korean_Peninsula escalated dramatically On Tuesday North_Korean that the country has practiced attempts to hit US military bases in Japan with a number of recently launched missiles The number of missiles fired suggested that North_Korea was training to see how quickly it could set_up its extended-range missiles in a wartime settingThat same day the United_States announced that it has begun deploying THAAD to While the land where the system is due to be deployed is not ready yet the equipment will be kept at a US air base in Osan until the site is prepared Full deployment is expected as early as JuneThe news of the THAAD_deployment sparked a threat of consequences from China I want to emphasize that we firmly oppose the deployment of THAAD said Geng_Shuang a spokesman for Chinas Foreign_Ministry at a on Tuesday We will resolutely take necessary measures to defend our security interestsOn the surface of it it may be hard to understand Beijings fury with THAAD For one thing its a purely defensive system THAAD systems dont carry warheads relying onthe force of the interceptor to destroy the incoming missile rather_than a detonation And while in theory the system could be used to intercept Chinese ballistic_missiles it would only work on missiles in their terminal phase ruling out those targeting the United_States which would still beascendingMoreover while China is well-known as a key ally and big brother of North_Korea it has shown itself to be exasperated by Pyongyangs recent missile_launches Beijing recently striking a major blow to the isolated nations economyInstead many experts argue that Chinas anger over THAAD has less to do with the missiles than with the sophisticated radar capabilities included in the system These radars couldbe used to track Chinas own missile systems potentially giving the United Statesa major advantage in any future conflict with China Some Chinese analysts argue that THAAD itself is of only limited use against North_Korea anyway as it would not be able to take out short-range missiles and artillery that do not reach high altitudes hinting that the radar may be the real reason for the deploymentMore broadly Beijing is concerned that the United_States is hoping to use both South_Korea and Japan to contain China in the future If South_Korea insists on becoming a US puppet China will have to act against it the nationalist state newspaper Global_Times wrote in an Chinesereaction appears to be moving to hurt South_Korea economically Beijing has already on Korean businesses that operate in China including shutting down stores of Lotte a South_Korean conglomerate that offered a golf course as land for THAAD useMore measures are expected Chinese travel agencies are stopping the sale of tickets to South_Korea and there have been growing calls in China to boycott South_Korean products and even cancel tours by K-pop stars Such moves carry significant weightSouth Korea has grown increasingly dependent economically on China in recent years Chinais South_Koreas largest trading partner and the to the country were $142 billion in 2014 more_than twice the value of its exports to the United StatesChinese pressure also comes at a time of political transition in South_Korea Scandal has sidelined PresidentPark Geun-hye who is expected to find out this week whether she will be impeached And Moon Jae-in the leading liberal candidate to replace her has suggested he may reconsider the THAAD deploymentDuring last years presidential campaign Donald Trump spoke frequently of the threat posed by North_Korea and suggested he may lean on China which he said had total control over North_Korea However since taking office in January the new US president has been uncharacteristically mute on the subject despite provocations from Pyongyang This has left many North Korea-watchers wondering what exactly his eventual policy will beThe deployment of THAAD seems to be one of the first real moves against North_Korea though it was largely a continuation of policies undertaken by President_Barack Obama The backlash from China and various dramatic moves by North_Korea however show that the situation is complicatedA mere 14 inches of snow has fallen the entire winter in Washington If everything comes together just right we could increase that total by many multiples Monday_night But the further south and east you go in the region the less certain significant snow becomesModel forecasts on Saturday evening generally suggested very significant snow will fall Monday_night in the metro region away from Southern Maryland and could even reach double digits However nagging questions about how heavy the precipitation will be and where the rain-snow_line will set_up remainBased on the latest information we think a general 5-10 inches seems like a reasonable first call for snowfall amounts in the immediate_metro with more to the north and northeast and less to the south and southeastBelow find the stream of updates from our evening live blog session which informed this snowfall forecast Looking at all of the models (granted the European is still to come out) I am impressed with what the GFS Canadian and UKMet models are collectively conveying A classic snowstorm for the DC area with a strong area of low pressure developing near Cape Hatteras and tracking to a position off the Delmarva Tuesday morning The models all agree the storm will pass through relatively quickly but also produce heavy snow I_think some of the precipitation amounts they are simulating are probably overdone but even cutting them by 25-50 percent would still produce substantial snowfallThe NAM_model with its razor sharp rain-snow_line cutting through the immediate_metro area is a concern But I am mostly discounting it as it is not supported by the other models and also is not particularly good with forecasts beyond 36 hours Having said that especially as its March we need to pay close attention to temperatures because if the other models are too cold and temperatures dont fall as forecast with the snow amounts will fall well short of their potentialA reasonable first forecast is for about 5-10 inches of snow in the immediate_metro area and lesser amounts to the south and southeast and greater amounts to the north and northeastSee our first accumulation map which could well need altering Sunday just above this updateConsider that small changes in the forecast track on Sunday would mean major changes to these numbersWell have a fresh forecast up at 6 am Sunday and then a detailed storm update out before noon after reviewing the next big set of model forecastsRemember to adjust your clocks forward to tonight Thanks for joining us Im about to wrap things up for the night but have one more update in which Ill try to synthesize what Ive seen this evening Look for it in about 20 minutes The UKMet model is in which while lesser known is actually the second best-performer behind the famed European model We dont have great maps for this model but the simulation we see looks more or less consistent with the GFS and Canadian in terms of the storm track which is a favorable one for significant snow in Washington At 8 am Tuesday the storm is centered off the Delmarva Coast and the model shows heavy precipitation having fallen see image below The Canadian model snowfall totals from DC to Boston are obscene in the 15-20 inch range and I_think probably overdone at_least in our region For one I dont_think the storm will intensify fast enough to deliver that amount of snow in Washington in under 12 hours Secondly that amount of snow has no historic precedent at this time of year Third it is generally the worst performing model Finally not all of the snow it simulates will stickHaving said all of that it does have some support from the GFS model which to me means you at_least have to consider the possibility of double digits totals in our area Belowa visualization of the storm from the Canadian model Its eerily similar to the GFS Snow begins just before 8 pm Monday in the metro region quickly becomes and heavy and pastes the region overnight It does_not mix with rain or sleet in this model and is a classic track for heavy snow from Cape Hatteras to a position east of the Delmarva The storm then exits quickly Tuesday morning The Canadian model forecast for Monday_night just in has a lot in common with the GFS It keeps the rain-snow_line well east of Interstate_95 and dumps a ton of snow in the immediate DC area Graphics coming in a few The fun is not over yet The Canadian model is in Looking at it now and will have comments in a few_minutes How much snow are we talking_about if the GFS model is right Assuming temperatures are at or below freezing for most of the storm and rain or sleet doesnt mix with the snow the numbers are mind-bogglingIt suggests the immediate_metro area would get 10-15 inches of snow and our northern suburbs would see 15-20 inches all in the course of about 12 hours This would be a historic storm if that comes to passA couple caveats 1) This model sometimes over-predicts the amount of precipitation in these kinds of storms 2) Some of the snow that fell initially would probably melt (or be wasted) due to temperatures above freezing for a timeas well as above freezing ground temperatureBelow is a simulation of the storm from the GFS model The storm moves into Washington around 8 pm Monday_night and is on its way out by around 8 am Tuesday morning But in that time the model suggests it unloads A LOT of snow The GFS model is in and snow lovers in the Washington region will like it Its a cold snowy forecast Once the precipitation begins Monday evening temperatures quickly fall to 32 degrees or lower and the rain-snow_line is a good deal east of Interstate_95 The model produces over 14 inches of liquid equivalent in Washington which would convert to a lot of snow given the models temperature forecast Ill post some graphics shortly The GFS model is flowing in right_now so well have some comments on it in the next few minutesWhile this storm will impact DC it could be a much bigger deal to our northeast If you have travel plans in New England Tuesday into early Wednesday expect there to be disruptions Look at this forecast for snowfall amounts over the entire Northeastern US it is impressiveWidespread totals of at_least a foot are expected from eastern Pennsylvania to eastern Massachusetts In_addition to the two versions of the NAM_model discussed below there is actually a third one run at even a higher resolution (3 kilometers) which we call the NAM 3K It has a forecast product which shows how_much snow will fall each hour and its forecast of the snowfall in the hour ending at 4 am Tuesday morning is fascinatingFirst of all notice how sharply the snow cuts off just east of Interstate_95 But then notice how heavy the snow is west of Interstate_95 ripping at the rate of 1 to 2 inches per hourThis one graphic shows why the the location of the rain-snow_line will be so important in this storm and how small deviations could have huge implications for the forecast For snow lovers depressed by the NAM_model simulation just shown I should point out an alternative version of this model is run at a higher resolution and is colder and snowier than its low-resolution version Rather than the rain-snow_line hovering west of Washington throughout this event it straddles the Interstate_95 corridor in the high-resolution NAM and would give DC and its close-in suburbs more snow than low-resolution NAM forecastsIts forecast suggests at_least 2 to 4 inches of snow in the regionCompare that to the low-resolution NAM which only suggests 1-2 inches in the immediate_metro though a bit more to the north and west Below isa NAM_model radar simulation of Monday nights storm If youre snow lover along and east of Interstate_95 you may not want to look as it would be your worst case scenario Basically it shows the rain-snow_line west of the Beltway for a large part of the event which would mean mostly rain or a rain-snow mix near the city and points east It even suggests our nearby western suburbs could have a good deal of mixingThis is not a good model forecast if you like snow except perhaps if you live north and west of Leesburg and FrederickBut remember what I wrote in my 931 pm update were outside the range at which this model is considered pretty reliable so you can take it with a grain of salt That said if the GFS running in about 30 minutes is similar then its time to worry The NAM_model is in and produces a good deal of precipitation around 1-14 inches liquid equivalent which would convert to a healthy amount of snow if all the precipitation falls as snow and doesnt mix with rain But there are a few red flags for snow lovers in this run 1) Precipitation starts off as rain in Washington and doesnt change to snow until potentially after midnight 2) It is a relatively short duration event less_than 12 hours The precipitation starts around 8 pm and is all over between 6 and 8 am 3) The model tends to have a wet bias and sometimes simulates too_much precipitationIll show some graphics in my next update One thing this storm will have going for it if you like snow is a strong area of cold high pressure to the north and northwest The presence of this high pressure is critical for supplying sufficient amounts of cold air for snow to fallSome of you may recall the March 6 2013 Snowquester storm in which large amounts of snow were forecast but didnt materialize In that case there was no cold high pressure system to the north which shouldve been a big warning sign for forecasters As we await the NAM_model which is just starting to come in we want to note that this model usually performs best within about 24-36 hours of a storm event As were about 48 hours away from this still were a little outside its best range so take our reports on this model with a grain of salt In_addition to producing a most likely snowfall forecast (see our first update from 850 pm) the National Weather Service now also issues forecasts for low-end and high-end possibilities For this particular storm in Washington its low-end forecast is 3 inches and its high-end forecast is 13 inches Thats quite a range but we think its a reasonable assessment given the complexity of the forecastThe potential minimum and maximums (min left max right)Literally the potential for 3 or 13 at DC (this will get narrowed in) TerpWeather (@TerpWeather) Normally at this time the NAM_model would be coming in so we could discuss it But there appear to be some delays at the National Weather Service (which runs this model) Well hopefully be able to start writing about it shortly To illustrate how close DC may be to the rain-snow_line Monday_night lets look at this (admittedly crude) representation of it from the SREF model (described below) The animation below shows three snapshots of the rain-snow_line Monday_night into Tuesday morning at 11 pm 2 am and 5 amNotice how the District goes from snow to rain to snow The rain-snow_line sets up right along Interstate_95 If youre north and west of it this group of models suggests you have a good chance to stay all snow But along it and especially to the south and east rain could mix in it times The first model well look at this evening is actually an average of a group of models known as the Short-range Ensemble Forecast System or SREF This group of models suggests the region will experience plenty of precipitation Monday_night into Tuesday the equivalent of 1 to 15 inches of rainOf course were expecting the majority of this precipitation to fall as snow Typically an inch of rain equates to about ten inches of snow But because Monday nights snow will be heavy and wet we might expect one inch of rain to equate to about seven inches of snow in the immediate_metro area Even with that assumption when you do the math this model is predicting the potential for a lot of snow with double digit totals possible in some areasA limitation of this model group is that some of the individual models which comprise it sometimes produce precipitation totals that are unrealistically high So its possible the amounts it is suggesting are slightly overdone To get us started lets take a look at the National Weather Service snow accumulation forecast The map below which was released at 810 pm predicts widespread totals of 4 to 10 inches with amounts increasing from southeast to northwest The highest amounts are north and west of the Beltway and a few spots in northern Maryland are predicted to exceed a foot The lowest totals are in southern Maryland where one to four inches or less are expectedTheres never a great time to fire off rockets potentially capable of carrying nuclear warheads but China has been left in an awkward position by the timing of North_Koreas latest ballistic_missile test experts said Pyongyang said Monday that this weekends test of the medium- to long-range missile had been according to the official KCNA news_agency But there was probably a collective groan in BeijingThe missile_launch took_place while President Trump was playing host to Japanese_Prime Minister_Shinzo Abe and it will intensify pressure on China from both their countries to do more to restrain North_Koreas nuclear ambitions The United_States and Japan along with South_Korea requested an urgent meeting of the UN_Security Council in New_York on Monday_night to discussthe incident Russias Foreign_Ministry also expressed concern the state-run RIA Novosti news_agency reportedChinas Foreign_Ministry said Monday that it opposed the test with spokesman_Geng Shuang telling reporters that his government would take a constructive and responsible part in the discussions at the United NationsThe missile test was conducted just as Sino-US_relations were beginning to look up a few days after Trump held what the White_House said was an extremely cordial with Chinese President_Xi Jinping But Trump has made clear in the past that he does_not think China is doing enough to rein in its ally in Pyongyang Zhang Liangui a Korea expert_at Beijings Central Party School which trains Communist Party officials said the timing was well thought through by Pyongyang to undermine Chinas ties with the United StatesIt clearly intended to affect the development of Sino-US_relations Zhang said But what matters is how China and the United_States handle itThe test also came as China campaigns hard against US plans to deploy the anti-missile Terminal_High Altitude Aerial Defense_(THAAD) system to South_Korea which Beijing considers a threat to its security It was a timely reminder to the Trump administration of why those missile_defense plans are important but also experts said to the candidates in this years presidential_election in South_Korea where public opinion on the issue is dividedThere was opposition in South_Korea to the THAAD_deployment said Cui Zhiying a Korean affairs expert_at Tongji University But after the missile test I fear these opposition voices will be greatly diminishedIn an editorial Monday the official English-language the missile test provided a good excuse for the United_States and its military allies to step up their cooperationAs usual Foreign_Ministry spokesman_Geng argued that the cause of North_Koreas nuclear program was its dispute with the United_States and called on all relevant parties to refrain from provoking each other and escalating tensions in the regionChina has long said that dialogue and consultation are the only way forward but the Obama_administration had refused to talk unless North_Korea first pledged to denuclearizeIn an Monday Chinas nationalist Global_Times newspaper called North_Koreas nuclear_weapon and ballistic_missile program a severe annoyance for Northeast Asia but also said that Pyongyang faces a very real military threat as well as harsh sanctionsWe can imagine the level of its upset and rage it said If Washington keeps cracking down on Pyongyangs nuclear development while turning a blind eye to North_Koreas concerns their current confrontation will develop into an absurd struggle Earlier in the day to take stronger action against North_Korea after the missile test the first conducted by Pyongyang since Trump took_office It said the test had improved the ability of Kim_Jong Uns government to put a nuclear_warhead on a missileAs a permanent member of the Security_Council and chair of the six-party talks and as a country that accounts for 90 percent of North_Koreas trade Chinas role is extremely important said Yoshihide Suga Japans chief cabinet secretary according to Bloomberg News As the government well continue to push China for constructive involvement at various levelsBefore taking office Trump North_Korea from acquiring the capability to strike the United_States with a nuclear_weapon In a joint appearance over the weekend Abe called the test absolutely intolerable and Trump said he stands by Japan 100 percentChina is North_Koreas primary ally and accounts for more_than 70 percent of its trade as well as providing food and energy aid Although it has supported limited sanctions by the Security_Council it is reluctant to take firm economic action that could destabilize the regimeNorth Korea has conducted five nuclear_tests including two last_year although its claims of being able to mount a nuclear_warhead on a missile have never been verified independently Kim said in his New Year speech that the North was close to test-launching an_intercontinental ballistic_missile (ICBM) potentially threatening the continental United_States which is about 5500 miles from North KoreaChina is unlikely to support tougher punishment for North_Korea unless and until it tests an ICBM or a nuclear_weapon said Euan Graham director of the International Security Program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney But he added that the latest test which appeared to be the second outing for a missile that could be fired from a submarine was a fairly significant step up the ladder and could threaten US bases in Asia Luna Lin and Xin Jin contributed to this reportThe independent investigation_into Trump-Russia collusion just made its most

Mueller_III And no collusion is not ruled outWhile the White_House could say thatthese indictments dont advance the collusionnarrative they dont negate it either said Ira Matetsky a partner at New_York City-based Ganfer and Shore law firmHere are some ofTrumps common claims about the investigation and why the facts dont necessarily back them up yetIt is now commonly agreed after many months of COSTLY looking that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump Was collusion with HC Donald_J Trump_(@realDonaldTrump) Trumps main argument here is that the FBI in some form or another has been looking into this for more_than a year and that because it hasnt come to a conclusion about collusion there must be noneIts true that the Manafort and Gates indictment doesnt mention the Trump campaign and refers to alleged crimes over the past decadeBut that doesnt mean the probe is over He could indict Manafort or anyone else of collusion-connected crimes any time he has evidence to do so said Jens David Ohlin a vice dean at Cornell Law UniversityYou cant rule out that [Mueller] didnt rule out Manafort colluding with Russia Ohlin saidWe do know hes also looking into Donald Trump Jrs meetings withKremlin-connected Russians whether the president obstructed justice when James Comey was the FBI_director and Mueller wouldnt have hired 16 17 people to investigate these events just to indict some tangential person unrelated to the campaignsaid white-collar lawyer Jeffrey JacobovitzThe timing of the indictments is noteworthy too In just five months Muellers_team has impaneled a federal grand_jury and now is charging Trumps former campaign_chairman Those are both significant escalationsNor has Congress dropped its investigation_into collusionEarlier this month top Senate Republican and Democratic investigators that after eight months of investigating hundreds of hours of interviews with more_than 100 people and nearly 100000 pages of documents they arent ready to rule out collusionTranslation At the very least accusations that the Trump campaign worked with Russia are not a hoax Its worth significant time and resources forthree committees in Congress and one independent investigation to continue to look into on a variety of frontsManafort and Gates are charged with something that does_not seem directly related to Russia collusion and Trump has used that fact to argue that this has nothing to do with his campaignExcept Trump may be getting out ahead of himself Many legal experts think Mueller is putting pressure on these outside figures to get them to cooperateby sharing what they know about Trumps inner circle If true that would explain the FBI knocking on Manaforts door in or the special_counsel CAnd then we get to Papadopoulos His guilty plea is directly related to Russia in that he gave false_statements to the FBI about his interaction with a Russian-connected professor during the campaign Muellerchose to telegraph on Monday thathe has someone on the inside of Trump world advising him which legal experts said underscores that this is far from overSome of Trumps allies have between the prosecutors Mueller has hired and their ties to Democrats Since Muellers_team is operating behind closed doors its been hard to directly rebut thatBut that logic falls into a gaping hole with this indictment Mueller has persuaded a federal_judge to set_up a grand_jury he has presented the evidence his team has found and that independent grand_jury decided to return an indictmentThis is out of Muellers hands Jacobovitz said Its an independent jury They could have declined the indictment but apparently they did notIts a first step and it could be one of many he
